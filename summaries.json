      "description" : "## What problem does this address?\n<!--\nPlease describe if this feature or enhancement is related to a current problem\nor pain point. For example, \"I'm always frustrated when ...\" or \"It is currently\ndifficult to ...\".\n-->\nMost of Block Editor components don't have stories.\nBlock Editor components's Storybook should also be added and updated like the Components.\nrelated #22891\n\n## What is your proposed solution?\n<!--\nPlease outline the feature or enhancement that you want and how it addresses any\nproblem identified above.\n-->\nWe can use this issue to track the addition and updating of the stories for Block Editor.\nYou can add the link to assign yourself to each component.\nAs I know, Block Editor Components list has never existed, so at first, we can start to be based on the directory name.\nThe list was made automatically, and we can ignore the component for native only.\n\nIf you cannot edit the list, please comment on which you made the PR for which directory's components.\n\ncc @WordPress/gutenberg-components \n\n## Best Practices\n\n### 1. Use CSF 3 format\n\nWrite stories as objects, not functions\n\n<details><summary>Do</summary>\n\n```jsx\nexport const Default = {\n\trender: function Template( { onChange, ...args } ) {\n\t\tconst [ value, setValue ] = useState();\n\t\treturn (\n\t\t\t<SomeComponent\n\t\t\t\t{ ...args }\n\t\t\t\tonChange={ ( ...changeArgs ) => {\n\t\t\t\t\tonChange( ...changeArgs );\n\t\t\t\t\tsetValue( ...changeArgs );\n\t\t\t\t} }\n\t\t\t\tvalue={ value }\n\t\t\t/>\n\t\t);\n\t},\n};\n```\n\n</details> \n\n<details><summary>Don't</summary>\n\n```jsx\nconst Template = ( { onChange, ...args } ) => {\n\tconst [ value, setValue ] = useState();\n\treturn (\n\t\t<SomeComponent\n\t\t\t{ ...args }\n\t\t\tonChange={ ( ...changeArgs ) => {\n\t\t\t\tonChange( ...changeArgs );\n\t\t\t\tsetValue( ...changeArgs );\n\t\t\t} }\n\t\t\tvalue={ value }\n\t\t/>\n\t);\n};\n\nexport const Default = Template.bind( {} );\n```\n\n</details> \n\n### 2. Consists of only one component\n \nThe purpose of Storybook is to test a single UI component itself. Therefore, unless there is a special reason, we should not include anything other than that component.\n\n### 3. Don???t create too many stories\n\nWhile it's tempting to expose as many variations of a component as possible, the behavior of the component can be changed in the Controls section.\n\nTherefore, additional stories should only be included if they involve significant visual or behavioral changes.\n\n### 4. About meta data\n\nTo display the source panel by default, specify `'shown'` in [the `meta.parameters.docs.canvas.sourceState` field](https://storybook.js.org/docs/api/doc-blocks/doc-block-canvas#sourcestate).\n\n<details><summary>Example</summary>\n\n```javascript\nconst meta = {\n\t// ...\n\tparameters: {\n\t\tdocs: {\n\t\t\tcanvas: { sourceState: 'shown' },\n\t\t\t// ...\n\t\t},\n\t},\n\t// ...\n};\n```\n\n</details> \n\nDefine the component description via the `meta.parameters.docs.description.component` field instead of a comment.\n\n<details><summary>Example</summary>\n\n```javascript\nconst meta = {\n\t// ...\n\tparameters: {\n\t\tdocs: {\n\t\t\t// ...\n\t\t\tdescription: {\n\t\t\t\tcomponent: 'Component description here...',\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t},\n\t},\n\t// ...\n};\n```\n\n</details> \n\nExplicitly define the type of props via the `meta.argTypes.{propName}.table.type.summary` field.\n\n<details><summary>Example</summary>\n\n```javascript\nconst meta = {\n\t// ...\n\targTypes: {\n\t\t// ...\n\t\tpropName: {\n\t\t\t// ...\n\t\t\ttable: {\n\t\t\t\ttype: {\n\t\t\t\t\tsummary: 'string',\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t},\n\t\t// ...\n\t},\n};\n```\n\n</details> \n\n\nFor private components, you may want to define the following fields to display the badge \uD83D\uDD12 ([Private APIs README](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/blob/trunk/packages/private-apis/README.md)).\n\nCheck [here](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/blob/f1fadbb036f1e702e3a28072444fd0de28a5dc02/packages/block-editor/src/private-apis.js#L57-L100) to see if the component is exported as private.\n\n<details><summary>Example</summary>\n\n```javascript\nconst meta = {\n\t// ...\n\ttags: [ 'status-private' ],\n\t// ...\n};\n```\n\n</details> \n\n### 5. Others\n\nIf the component you're working on doesn't have a README or JDoc, I'd appreciate it if you could do the following to clarify the component's implementation first:\n\n- If there's no README file: This is part of https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/22891. If the component already has JSDoc, you can use it to help write the README.\n- If there's no README and no JSDoc: You'll need to analyze the component's implementation and clarify the types of props and return types. See https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/22891#issuecomment-2543030487 for information on the JSDoc format.\n\n## Block Editor Components directories List\n\n\n<details><summary>Components List</summary>\n\nNote: \uD83D\uDD12 indicates that the component is private.\n\n\n\n- [x] alignment-control #67046\n  - `AlignmentControl`\n  -  `AlignmentToolbar`\n- [x] ~audio-player (for native only)~\n- [ ] autocomplete (`BlockEditorAutocomplete` based on `Autocomplete` from `@wordpress/components`.

Working in the isolated story when iterating on the component (as opposed to working directly in the Gutenberg app) promotes better engineering standards because it forces you to think about encapsulation, clear interfaces, etc.\n- Increase iteration speed. Having a story is much faster for discovery and testing different states. You don't have to dig around the app to see where the component is used, figure out what states exist, and how to reproduce them.\n\nI honestly don't know if there is pure documentation value for the extenders.\n\nI'd like to emphasize that we should write the stories in a way that **keeps maintenance cost at a minimum**. It will quickly become a net-negative if the stories incur a maintenance cost. For example, avoid hardcoded values as much as possible, and try to structure things in a way that will not need fixing when the underlying component code changes. Don't write unnecessary descriptions, as those are another thing that need to be updated manually when things change. Let's start with the simplest possible.", "As a plugin developer, I find Storybook extremely useful.\n\nWhen implementing a UI for a custom block or block editor, I can see what components are exposed, what props are supported, and how they work.\n\nWithout Storybook, it's hard to imagine how something would work unless I actually wrote the code while reading the documentation, or found a place in the Gutenberg repository where the component is actually used.", "I have looked at the PR linked to this issue and I think we need some kind of indicator to unify our implementations and approaches for contributors who are already working on this issue or are planning to work on it.\n\nBelow are my thoughts on best practices, but @WordPress/gutenberg-components, if there are any mistakes, please let me know.\n\n### Use CSF 3 format\n\nWrite stories as objects, not functions\n\n#### Do\n\n```jsx\nexport const Default = {\n\trender: function Template( { onChange, ...args } ) {\n\t\tconst [ value, setValue ] = useState();\n\t\treturn (\n\t\t\t<SomeComponent\n\t\t\t\t{ ...args }\n\t\t\t\tonChange={ ( ...changeArgs ) => {\n\t\t\t\t\tonChange( ...changeArgs );\n\t\t\t\t\tsetValue( ...changeArgs );\n\t\t\t\t} }\n\t\t\t\tvalue={ value }\n\t\t\t/>\n\t\t);\n\t},\n};\n```\n\n#### Don't\n\n```jsx\nconst Template = ( { onChange, ...args } ) => {\n\tconst [ value, setValue ] = useState();\n\treturn (\n\t\t<SomeComponent\n\t\t\t{ ...args }\n\t\t\tonChange={ ( ...changeArgs ) => {\n\t\t\t\tonChange( ...changeArgs );\n\t\t\t\tsetValue( ...changeArgs );\n\t\t\t} }\n\t\t\tvalue={ value }\n\t\t/>\n\t);\n};\n\nexport const Default = Template.bind( {} );\n```\n\n### Consists of only one component\n\nI think the purpose of Storybook is to test a single UI component itself.

If you want this feature, can you help us support it? You can add some logging in the openai api server to print the raw input if a flag is set.", "I also want this feature for debug purposes. However, integrating it into the tokenizer_manager might be challenging because input and input_ids are designed to be mutually exclusive. Avoiding tokenization here and using a \"print-then-encode\" approach could lead to messy code https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/blob/bdb3929dbb8f14d22c4a27ee2d8840751752658c/python/sglang/srt/openai_api/adapter.py#L911\r\n\r\nTo implement this, we would need to update v1_generation, v1_chat_generation, and v1_embedding individually. This is because we cannot defer the logging behavior to tokenizer_manager.generate_request. Instead, we must handle it directly within each of the v1_ handler functions.\r\n\r\nHow about creating an HTTP middleware to log the request body? This approach would be easier to maintain.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@app.middleware(\"http\")\r\nasync def log_request_middleware(request: Request, call_next):\r\n    if tokenizer_manager.server_args.log_requests and request.method == \"POST\":\r\n        try:\r\n            if tokenizer_manager.server_args.log_requests:\r\n                # Log request headers\r\n                logger.info(f\"Request headers: {request.headers}\")\r\n\r\n                # Log request body (if applicable)\r\n                body = await request.body()\r\n                if body:\r\n                    logger.info(f\"Request body: {body.decode('utf-8')}\")\r\n                else:\r\n                    logger.info(\"Request body: (empty)\")\r\n\r\n        except Exception as e:\r\n            # Log the error but do not raise an exception\r\n            logger.error(f\"Error logging request: {e}\")\r\n            # Continue processing the request\r\n\r\n    # Call the next middleware or route handler\r\n    response = await call_next(request)\r\n    return response\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe log will look like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[2025-01-04 18:22:27] INFO:     Started server process [328134]\r\n[2025-01-04 18:22:27] INFO:     Waiting for application startup.\r\n[2025-01-04 18:22:27] INFO:     Application startup complete.\r\n[2025-01-04 18:22:27] INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:30000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)\r\n[2025-01-04 18:22:28] Starting new HTTP connection (1): 172.28.144.1:7890\r\n[2025-01-04 18:22:29] Request headers: Headers({'host': '127.0.0.1:30000', 'accept-encoding': 'gzip, deflate', 'connection': 'keep-alive', 'accept': 'application/json', 'content-type': 'application/json', 'user-agent': 'OpenAI/Python 1.58.1', 'x-stainless-lang': 'python', 'x-stainless-package-version': '1.58.1', 'x-stainless-os': 'Linux', 'x-stainless-arch': 'x64', 'x-stainless-runtime': 'CPython', 'x-stainless-runtime-version': '3.12.8', 'authorization': 'Bearer None', 'x-stainless-async': 'false', 'x-stainless-retry-count': '0', 'content-length': '480'})\r\n[2025-01-04 18:22:29] Request body: {\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"List 3 countries and their capitals.\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Sure, here are 3 countries and their capitals:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"1.

How to add support for a new model\n\nImplement the `MixtureOfExperts` protocol. Specifically, you???ll need to:\n\n- Expose relevant MoE configuration flags.\n- Provide access to expert weights for EPLB to rearrange.\n- Forward EPLB-related arguments into the `FusedMoE` layer.\n\n\uD83D\uDCCC **Note on weight loading:**  \nFor models with **redundant experts**, you???ll need to carefully adjust the weight loading logic. `FusedMoE` returns an `expert_params_mapping` that reflects expert duplication, but you may need to modify the model class to ensure correct loading behavior.\n\n\uD83D\uDD0E Example: See how it???s done in [`deepseek_v2.py`](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/18343/files#diff-420f1cd67991a63cb419ca0e00e6f42cbe825864d0541e0662eeed2f9ddbd021).\n\n---\n\n### ??? How to add support for quantized models\n\nThis is usually even easier???just make sure EPLB-related arguments are properly forwarded in your quantization path.\n\n\uD83D\uDD0E Example: See [`fp8.py`](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/18343/files#diff-5511bfcc9c53f7d96517ad43e4087f6777bef21302da983f42cafae40a866644) for a minimal working change.\n\n---\n\n\uD83D\uDC4B **Want to contribute?**\n\nWe???d love your help in extending EPLB support! Feel free to comment below or open a draft PR???we???re happy to guide you through the process.\n\n### Alternatives\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Before submitting a new issue...\n\n- [x] Make sure you already searched for relevant issues, and asked the chatbot living at the bottom right corner of the [documentation page](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/), which can answer lots of frequently asked questions.",

      "comments" : [ "Hey @hrzn, I would happy to give it a try.\r\n\r\nJust to be clear, I imagine we can parallelise the _iterate and forecast_ part, i.e. the cycle at line 472:\r\n```python\r\nfor _counter, pred_time in enumerate(iterator):\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\nHowever, while this is almost straightforward when `retrain=False`, I wouldn't be sure how to approach it if a retrain is involved due to the fact that a certain trained model should predict only until the next retrain.", "Hi @FBruzzesi, thanks for the proposal!\r\n\r\nIf you want to take a stab at it, you can checkout how parallelisation is done in `gridsearch()` with `num_jobs`.\r\nFor `historical_forecasts()`, we could follow a similar approach. There are two iterators now; an \"outer\" one [here](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/blob/8f3d510d9bf3ad6799df0b82ac3bf86241fc9393/darts/models/forecasting/forecasting_model.py#L735) over the time series and an \"inner\" one [here](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/blob/8f3d510d9bf3ad6799df0b82ac3bf86241fc9393/darts/models/forecasting/forecasting_model.py#L844) iterating over the train/validation splits.\r\nI think we could probably refactor this a bit in order to have the two for loops inside a generator, producing the right elements for each iteration step (e.g. yielding the right split index of the train/val sub-series). We could also extract the processing logic inside an inner function, which would be called from `_parallel_apply()`, so something like:\r\n```python\r\nresults = _parallel_apply(iterator, _train_and_forecast, n_jobs, ...)\r\n```\r\nwhere the `_train_and_forecast()` contains the logic to optionally re-train the model and obtain the forecast.", "Hi @hrzn , I think the issue's stale if that's the case I'd love to pick it up. As for the code itself, I've been browsing it and retrain param definitely raises complexity. \r\nMy current rough implementation overview for making both loops async:\r\n\r\n1. If retrain is bool -> We either always retrain a new model or train it once, either way implementation is straightforward\r\n2. Otherwise:\r\n    * Find the subsequences where the model doesn't need to be retrained\r\n    * Assign each of them a unique id which will be shared among its elements ex. (time_series_index, subsequence_index)\r\n    * Fit a model for each id and save it in a dictionary, indexed by that id (might be memory intensive, but I don't have a better idea)\r\n    * Iterate over time_series asynchronously, get their ids either by bisect -> each TimeSeries has a list holding indexes when the model is retrained, or by iterating over zip(time_series_sequences, time_series_sequence_ids)\r\n    * Create a list where each entry has id (time_series_index, prediction_index) and then create final forecasts from it\r\n\r\nLet me know if this makes sense, btw. with the university winter break ending and this issue being harder than what I'm used to it might take me a while (1-2 months) to put the code together (1-2 months)", "@JanFidor we currently have some plans to refactor `historical_forecasts()` for Torch models and RegressionModels, in order to make better use of batching and vectorization, which should bring drastic speedups, and would also allow more efficient use of multiple CPU cores. Now, there might still be some value in parallelizing cmputation for the other models (typically the \"non-ML\" models where things cannot really be vectorized easily). However my suggestion would be to wait that we first implement the vectorized approaches for ML models. That might bring quite a lot of changes to this function, and we will see more clearly afterwards what remains to be done.\r\nPing @dennisbader ", "@hrzn Sure thing! Changing anything in `historical_forecasts()` just before a major refactor would definitely be a waste of time, I'll stay put for now and revisit the topic if there's an actual usecase for parallelisation after the refactor is merged", "Hey folks - what's the latest on this? ", "Hey, any further plans for this one ?", "The latest updates:\r\n- Historical forecasts were optimized for pre-trained regression and torch forecasting models (the neural networks) with `retrain=False`. \r\n- metrics were optimized and n*20 times faster than before, where n is the number of series components (when the issue was raised)\r\n- additionally, the metrics computation can be parallelized in backtest through `metrics_kwargs` and \"n_jobs\".\r\n\r\nThe only parallelization left to do (which I'm not even 100% sure it will work with all models) is for:\r\n- local models\r\n- regression models and torch forecasting models with `retrain != False`\r\n- regression models with `forecast_horizon > output_chunk_length`: this has to go into the dedicated optimized historical forecasts routine for regression models", "Is there any news about this?" ],

      "description" : "## \uD83E\uDDF1 Devcontainer Setup for Unified Development Environment\n\n### \uD83C\uDFAF Goal\n\nProvide a consistent development environment via Devcontainers to reduce onboarding friction and tooling issues across contributors. This image will be used by all SCORE-related repositories (dozens in total), so it must be robust, reusable, and actively maintained.\n\n---\n\n### ??? Current Situation\n\nWe currently require a number of tools to be installed in addition to Bazel. This includes Python, Graphviz, Bazelisk, and shell autocompletion for Bazel. These tools are not always easy to install correctly across different systems, especially for new contributors.\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDE80 Solution\n\nImplement a reusable Devcontainer setup based on a Docker image that includes all required tools preinstalled. The image should be published to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) and referenced via `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` or `.devcontainer.json` in consuming repositories.\n\n**Target image name:** `ghcr.io/eclipse-score/devcontainer`\n\nThe base image should include:\n\n- Based on an extended Ubuntu image, quite certainly:\n  - `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/python:1.2-3.12`\n- Preinstalled tools:\n  - Python (needed for Bazel formatting bug workaround)\n  - Graphviz\n  - Bazelisk (with current bazel version pre-downloaded)\n  - Shell autocompletion for Bazel\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDEE0??? Concrete Tasks\n\n- [ ] Create a new GitHub repository (name: `eclipse-score/devcontainer`)\n- [ ] Create a `Dockerfile` that installs all required tools\n- [ ] Add GitHub Actions workflow to:\n  - Build the image\n  - Optional: Tag it with semantic version (e.g. `v1.0.0`) and `latest`\n  - Push to GHCR under `ghcr.io/eclipse-score/devcontainer`\n- [ ] Optional: Add typical metadata to the container\n- [ ] Use the image from GHCR in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` or `.devcontainer.json` in at least one repo (e.g. `score`)\n- [ ] Verify that all tools are functional inside the container\n- [ ] Optional: Add documentation (`README.md`) to `eclipse-score/devcontainer`\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDD04 Considered Alternatives\n\nSome tools could theoretically be installed via Bazel, but this was previously evaluated and rejected due to high implementation and maintenance cost. We chose to use system-level tools with clear documentation instead.\n\n---\n\n### \uD83E\uDDE0 Notes\n\n- The image will become the base for all development work across the SCORE ecosystem\n- Keep it generic, stable, and easy to extend.\n- This devcontainer will remain entirely optional, it's just meant to ease the pain of installing all the required tools.\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDCDA References\n\n- Example: [`eclipse-score/score/.devcontainer`](https://github.com/eclipse-score/score/tree/main/.devcontainer)\n- Docs: [Development Environment Setup](https://eclipse-score.github.io/score/main/contribute/development/development_environment.html#autocompletion-in-the-shell)\n",

However, that one is based on Debian instead of Ubuntu. A few of the tools have packages which are created for specific Ubuntu releases only. Also, I'd argue that Ubuntu is more often used in \"commercial contexts\". S-CORE is Open Source, of course, but the primary usage is commercial. Hence, using a commercially supported OS has advantages.", "Fine with me, so far I'm workin in that container, but I don't care which one it is, as long as it's working :-)\n\nIMHO `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:ubuntu` would make sense then.\n\n> Beyond git, this image / Dockerfile includes zsh, [Oh My Zsh!](https://ohmyz.sh/), a non-root vscode user with sudo access, and a set of common dependencies for development.\n\nIt's not a lot.

      "description" : "## Issue Creation Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I understand that my issue will be automatically closed if I don't fill in the requested information\r\n- [x] I have read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\n## Feature Description\r\n\r\n### Describe the feature you'd like to see implemented\r\n\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. How can the requested feature be used to approach the problem it's supposed to solve? -->\r\n<!-- If applicable, add a code snippet showing how your feature would be used in a real use-case -->\r\n\r\nSupport [SQLite STRICT tables](https://www.sqlite.org/stricttables.html)\r\n\r\nCurrently - `{ \"sequelize\": \"^6.29.0\", \"sqlite3\": \"^5.1.4\" }` - if I define a model with an attribute, and create an instance of that model using a value whose type is incompatible with the type of the attribute, the operation succeeds. SQLite documents this as a feature, but provides the `STRICT` table-option to disable it. I request that Sequelize explicitly support `STRICT` tables in SQLite - in particular, provide a mechanism by which to create them.\r\n\r\nThe following code defines two models, `Fruit` and `Vegetable`. It allows Sequelize to generate the schema for `Fruit`, but provides its own for `Vegetable` - including `STRICT` - before `sync()`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport sqlite3 from \"sqlite3\";\r\nimport { Sequelize, DataTypes } from \"sequelize\";\r\n\r\nconst sze = new Sequelize({\r\n  dialect: \"sqlite\",\r\n  storage: \"main.db\",\r\n  dialectOptions: {\r\n    mode: sqlite3.OPEN_READWRITE | sqlite3.OPEN_CREATE | sqlite3.OPEN_FULLMUTEX\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n\r\nconst Fruit = sze.define('Fruit', {\r\n  name: DataTypes.STRING,\r\n});\r\n\r\nconst Vegetable = sze.define('Vegetable', {\r\n  name: DataTypes.STRING,\r\n});\r\n\r\nconst [res, met] = await sze.query(\r\n  \"CREATE TABLE `Vegetables` (\" +\r\n  \"`id` INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, \" +\r\n  \"`name` TEXT, \" +\r\n  \"`createdAt` TEXT NOT NULL, \" +\r\n  \"`updatedAt` TEXT NOT NULL\" +\r\n  \") STRICT;\"\r\n);\r\n\r\nawait sze.sync();\r\n\r\nconsole.log(\"Synced\");\r\n\r\n\r\nconsole.log(\"Fruit str\");\r\nconsole.log(!!await Fruit.create({ name: \"lychee\" }));\r\n\r\nconsole.log(\"Fruit buf\");\r\nconsole.log(!!await Fruit.create({ name: Buffer.from([100]) }));\r\n\r\n\r\nconsole.log(\"Vege str\");\r\nconsole.log(!!await Vegetable.create({ name: \"potato\" }));\r\n\r\nconsole.log(\"Vege buf\");\r\nconsole.log(!!await Vegetable.create({ name: Buffer.from([101]) }));\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt demonstrates the behavior of each table; both `Fruit` are inserted, and the one called `<Buffer 64>`, which is a value that cannot be losslessly converted to `TEXT` is inserted with a `BLOB` value in the `name` column. The second vegetable insert fails, because `STRICT` prevents this mixture.\r\n\r\n```\r\nExecuting (default): CREATE TABLE `Vegetables` (`id` INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, `name` TEXT, `createdAt` TEXT NOT NULL, `updatedAt` TEXT NOT NULL) STRICT;\r\nExecuting (default): SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name='Fruits';\r\nExecuting (default): CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `Fruits` (`id` INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, `name` VARCHAR(255), `createdAt` DATETIME NOT NULL, `updatedAt` DATETIME NOT NULL);\r\nExecuting (default): PRAGMA INDEX_LIST(`Fruits`)\r\nExecuting (default): SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name='Vegetables';\r\nExecuting (default): PRAGMA INDEX_LIST(`Vegetables`)\r\nSynced\r\nFruit str\r\nExecuting (default): INSERT INTO `Fruits` (`id`,`name`,`createdAt`,`updatedAt`) VALUES (NULL,$1,$2,$3);\r\ntrue\r\nFruit buf\r\nExecuting (default): INSERT INTO `Fruits` (`id`,`name`,`createdAt`,`updatedAt`) VALUES (NULL,$1,$2,$3);\r\ntrue\r\nVege str\r\nExecuting (default): INSERT INTO `Vegetables` (`id`,`name`,`createdAt`,`updatedAt`) VALUES (NULL,$1,$2,$3);\r\ntrue\r\nVege buf\r\nExecuting (default): INSERT INTO `Vegetables` (`id`,`name`,`createdAt`,`updatedAt`) VALUES (NULL,$1,$2,$3);\r\nnode:internal/process/esm_loader:97\r\n    internalBinding('errors').triggerUncaughtException(\r\nError\r\n  [stack trace removed]\r\n  name: 'SequelizeUniqueConstraintError',\r\n  errors: [],\r\n  parent: [Error: SQLITE_CONSTRAINT: cannot store BLOB value in TEXT column Vegetables.name] {\r\n    errno: 19,\r\n    code: 'SQLITE_CONSTRAINT',\r\n    sql: 'INSERT INTO `Vegetables` (`id`,`name`,`createdAt`,`updatedAt`) VALUES (NULL,$1,$2,$3);'\r\n  },\r\n  original: [Error: SQLITE_CONSTRAINT: cannot store BLOB value in TEXT column Vegetables.name] {\r\n    errno: 19,\r\n    code: 'SQLITE_CONSTRAINT',\r\n    sql: 'INSERT INTO `Vegetables` (`id`,`name`,`createdAt`,`updatedAt`) VALUES (NULL,$1,$2,$3);'\r\n  },\r\n  fields: [],\r\n  sql: 'INSERT INTO `Vegetables` (`id`,`name`,`createdAt`,`updatedAt`) VALUES (NULL,$1,$2,$3);'\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt should be possible to create the table `Vegetables` without `query(sqlText)`.\r\n\r\n### Describe why you would like this feature to be added to Sequelize\r\n\r\n<!-- Short explanation why this should be part of Sequelize rather than a separate package. -->\r\n\r\nImplementation of this feature requires modifications, not just extensions. For example, the SQLite query generation function for table creation needs to return a different string.\r\n\r\n### Is this feature dialect-specific?\r\n\r\n- [ ] No. This feature is relevant to Sequelize as a whole.\r\n- [x] Yes. This feature only applies to the following dialect(s):\r\n  - `sqlite`\r\n\r\n### Would you be willing to resolve this issue by submitting a Pull Request?\r\n\r\n<!-- Remember that first contributors are welcome! -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, I have the time and I know how to start.\r\n- [x] Yes, I have the time but I will need guidance.\r\n- [ ] No, I don't have the time, but my company or I are [supporting Sequelize through donations on OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/sequelize).\r\n- [ ] No, I don't have the time, and I understand that I will need to wait until someone from the community or maintainers is interested in implementing my feature.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<!-- do not delete this footer -->\r\n\r\n*Indicate your interest in the addition of this feature by adding the \uD83D\uDC4D reaction. Comments such as \"+1\" will be removed.*\r\n",

We need to add more to cover all the code in vllm-ascend, and there are several principles to follow:\n\n1. The overall file tree should be consistent with `vllm_ascend`\n2. The file name should be the original file name with a prefix `test_`\n3. Use `unittest` framework, make good use of mock\n4. The UTs are all running on cpu node, mock the function related to device to host\n\nPlease refer to the official doc on [contributing](https://vllm-ascend.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide/contribution/index.html) and [testing](https://vllm-ascend.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide/contribution/testing.html) to develop, thanks!\n### Unit tests need to add\n\n- [ ] |-- test__version.py\n- [x] |-- test_ascend_config.py\n- [ ] |-- test_attention\n- [ ] |   |-- test_attention.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_attention_v1.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_mla_v1.py\n- [ ] |-- compilation\n- [ ] |   `-- test_piecewise_backend.py\n- [ ] |-- core\n- [ ] |   |-- test_schedule_config.py @nuclearwu\n- [ ] |   `-- test_scheduler.py\n- [ ] |-- device_allocator\n- [ ] |   `-- test_camem.py\n- [ ] |-- distributed\n- [ ] |   |-- test_communicator.py @FieeFlip\n- [ ] |   |-- test_device_communicators @Agonixiaoxiao #1601\n- [ ] |   |   |-- test_pyhccl.py\n- [ ] |   |   `-- test_pyhccl_wrapper.py\n- [x] |   |-- kv_transfer @Agonixiaoxiao \n- [x] |   |   |-- test_simple_buffer.py https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1531\n- [x] |   |   |-- test_simple_connector.py https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1531\n- [x] |   |   |-- test_simple_pipe.py https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1531\n- [ ] |   |   `-- test_utils.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_llmdatadist_connector.py\n- [x] |   `-- test_parallel_state.py   @wangyanhui-cmss https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1460\n- [ ] |-- test_envs.py\n- [ ] |-- lora\n- [ ] |   `-- punica_wrapper @hongfugui\n- [ ] |       `-- test_punica_npu.py @hongfugui\n- [ ] |-- models\n- [ ] |   |-- test_deepseek_dbo.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_deepseek_mtp.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_deepseek_v2.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_qwen2_5_vl.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_qwen2_5_vl_without_padding.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_qwen2_vl.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_qwen3_moe.py\n- [ ] |-- multistream\n- [ ] |   |-- test_base.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_context.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_decorator.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_layers.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_metadata.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_ms_split.py\n- [ ] |-- ops\n- [ ] |   |-- test_activation.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_attention.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_cache.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_common_fused_moe.py\n- [x] |   |-- test_expert_load_balancer.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_fused_moe.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_layernorm.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_rotary_embedding.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_vocab_parallel_embedding.py\n- [ ] |-- patch\n- [ ] |   |-- platform\n- [ ] |   |   |-- patch_0_9_1\n- [ ] |   |   |-- patch_common\n- [ ] |   |   |   `-- test_test_patch_distributed.py\n- [ ] |   |   `-- patch_main\n- [ ] |   `-- worker\n- [ ] |       |-- patch_0_9_1\n- [ ] |       |-- patch_common\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_distributed.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_eagle.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_minicpm.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_multi_step_worker.py\n- [x] |       |   |-- test_patch_sampler.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_spec_decode_worker.py\n- [ ] |       |   `-- test_patch_utils.py\n- [ ] |       `-- patch_main\n- [x] |-- test_platform.py @zhanghw0354 https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1476\n- [ ] |-- quantization\n- [ ] |   |-- test_func_wrapper.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_quant_config.py @nuclearwu\n- [ ] |   |-- test_quantizer.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_w8a8.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_w8a8_dynamic.py\n- [ ] |-- sample\n- [ ] |   |-- ops\n- [ ] |   `-- test_rejection_sampler.py\n- [x] |-- test_utils.py\n- [ ] `-- worker \n- [ ] |-- test_cache_engine.py @machenglong2025\n- [ ] |-- test_draft_model_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_model_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_model_runner_v1.py\n- [ ]  |-- test_mtp_proposer_v1.py @machenglong2025\n- [ ] |-- test_multi_step_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_multi_step_worker.py\n- [ ] |-- test_pooling_model_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_worker.py @zhanghw0354\n- [ ] `-- test_worker_v1.py @zhanghw0354\n",

Since ProbeRunner already stores this reference internally, this integration would be straightforward.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> SourceFile has no finalize/teardown lifecycle, we need to implement one and use in AstAnalyser (probably)\n\n## Example\n\nHere???s a snippet of code that would be moved into the initialize callback of the `isWeakCrypto` probe:\n\n```js\nthis.tracer = new VariableTracer()\n  .enableDefaultTracing()\n  // ????????? this part\n  .trace(\"crypto.createHash\", {\n    followConsecutiveAssignment: true, moduleName: \"crypto\"\n  });\n```\n\nWe don't need to trace `crypto.createHash` if the isWeakCrypto probe is not used.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e7dca6f-1881-423b-9fb1-ab8c55736a7a)",

      "repositoryName" : "dapr/cli",
      "description" : "## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nI would like to think I should be able to ctrl-c to kill the `dapr run` process once I see an err. I don't really care to see it err more after I know what is wrong after seeing 1 err.\r\n\r\n## Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nI am unable to ctrl-c and end the `dapr run` early. I am forced to wait about 1 minute for the command to finish failing. It looks like it did receive my signal to cancel: `terminated signal received: shutting down`, but I feel as though there is room for improvement here, as to a user it looks like it never accepted my `^C^C^C^C^C^C^C`.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce the Problem\r\n\r\nFollow the [README here](https://github.com/dapr/java-sdk/blob/master/examples/src/main/java/io/dapr/examples/querystate/README.md#running-the-example), and do not create the statestore. \r\n\r\nRun the query state example with this command without having a mongo-statestore:\r\n```\r\ndapr run --components-path ./components/state --app-id query-state-example -H 3600 -- java -Ddapr.api.protocol=HTTP -jar target/dapr-java-sdk-examples-exec.jar io.dapr.examples.querystate.QuerySavedState\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt will take its time, and even if you ctrl-c, it will still fail slowly for a while after you try to cancel. See output of running the above command below:\r\n```\r\nFlag --components-path has been deprecated, This flag is deprecated and will be removed in the future releases. Use \"resources-path\" flag instead\r\n??????  Starting Dapr with id query-state-example. HTTP Port: 3600. gRPC Port: 57846\r\n??????

As a result, users will not be able to identify the purpose or destination of the link.\nEmpty links can be confusing for screen reader users, keyboard users, and others relying on assistive technologies, as they have no way of knowing the purpose or destination of the link.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. go to /reference/p5.sound/\n2.  Locate to the following element:\n._linklabel_aobbt_1052 (CSS Selector)\n\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n* The element is a link (<a>) with no visible text content, and no accessible text through aria-label or other means.\n* When tabbing to the link, a screen reader announces only ???link??? without any label or description.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n* All links should have meaningful, descriptive text that communicates their purpose or destination???even when read out of context.

Embedding the guidance inline eliminates context-switching to docs and reduces onboarding time.\n\n---\n\n### \uD83E\uDDED Type of Feature\n\n* [x] Enhancement to existing functionality\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDE4B????????? User Story 1 ??? Creation Buttons\n\n**As a:** Gateway administrator\n**I want:** clear tooltips on every \"Add New ???\" button\n**So that:** I instantly understand what gets created before clicking.\n\n#### ??? Acceptance Criteria\n\n```gherkin\nScenario: Tooltip on \"Add New Server\"\n  Given I am on the \"Virtual Servers Catalog\" panel\n  When I hover OR keyboard-focus the \"??? Add New Server\" control\n  Then a tooltip appears within 200 ms reading\n       \"Creates a new Virtual Server by combining Tools, Resources & Prompts from global catalogs.\"\n  And the tooltip disappears when the control loses hover/focus\n\nScenario: Tooltip on other creation buttons\n  Given I am on each catalog panel (Tools, Resources, Prompts, Gateways, Roots)\n  When I hover/focus the respective \"Add New ???\" control\n  Then I see the tooltip text listed in \"Tooltip Copy Map\" (below)\n```\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDE4B????????? User Story 2 ??? Action Buttons\n\n**As a:** Gateway administrator\n**I want:** hover help for critical row-level actions (?????? Test, \uD83D\uDD04 Activate/Deactivate, \uD83D\uDDD1??? Delete)\n**So that:** I avoid unintended destructive operations.\n\n#### ??? Acceptance Criteria\n\n```gherkin\nScenario: Tooltip on Deactivate action\n  Given a tool row shows \"Deactivate\"\n  When I hover/focus the link\n  Then a tooltip reads \"Temporarily disables this item (can be re-activated).\"\n\nScenario: Tooltip on Delete action\n  Given a row shows \"Delete\"\n  When I hover/focus the link\n  Then a tooltip reads \"Permanently deletes this item ??? cannot be undone.\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDE4B????????? User Story 3 ??? Accessibility & Theme Support\n\n**As a:** keyboard-only or screen-reader user\n**I want:** tooltips to appear on focus and expose ARIA `aria-describedby` text\n**So that:** the guidance is available without a mouse and in both light/dark modes.\n\n#### ??? Acceptance Criteria\n\n```gherkin\nScenario: Keyboard focus\n  When I tab to any actionable element with a tooltip\n  Then the tooltip becomes visible\n  And the element has aria-describedby linking to the tooltip content\n\nScenario: Dark mode\n  Given I toggle dark mode\n  Then tooltip styling remains legible (contrast ratio ??? 4.5:1)\n```\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDCDD Tooltip Copy Map\n\n| Location                | Control              | Tooltip text                                                                               |\n| ----------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Virtual Servers Catalog | **Add New Server**   | Creates a new Virtual Server by combining Tools, Resources & Prompts from global catalogs. |\n| Global Tools            | **Add New Tool**     | Registers a new Tool from an existing REST or MCP endpoint.                                |\n| Global Resources        | **Add New Resource** | Uploads or links a reusable data asset (file, URI, or text).                               |\n| Global Prompts          | **Add New Prompt**   | Creates a reusable message template with parameters.                                       |\n| Gateways / MCP Servers  | **Add New Gateway**  | Registers an external MCP server and imports its catalogs.                                 |\n| Roots                   | **Add New Root**     | Registers a base directory that MCP servers can browse for files.                          |\n| Row action ???

Open the app and try to log in with your username and password\n3. An email verification input field should appear\n4. Make sure email verification input field is focused\n5. Tap on the `Enter` button in the software keyboard of Android\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nThe **IME Action** for the email verification input field should be either `Done` or `Go`. Also, the input field's height shouldn't increase when pressing the `Enter` button.\n\n### Actual behaviour\n\nThe `Enter` **IME Action** is displayed in the Android's soft keyboard, and tapping that increases the input field's height.\n\n### Device name\n\nPixel 6\n\n### Android version\n\nAndroid 14\n\n### Commons app version\n\nMain Branch\n\n### Device logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### Screen-shots\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7177768-7721-405e-a838-90b12a1a6a9c\n\n### Would you like to work on the issue?\n\nPrefer not",

Feel free to drop by [our chat](https://owncast.rocket.chat) if you'd like to discuss in real-time with people.", "## Good First Issue\n\n This item was marked as a good first issue because of the following:\n\n - It's self contained as a single feature or change.\n - Is clear when it's complete.\n - You do not need deep knowledge of Owncast to accomplish it.\n\n\n ### Next Steps\n\n 1. Comment on this issue before starting work so it can be assigned to you. Also, this issue may have been filed with limited detail or changes may have occurred that are worth sharing with you before you start work.\n 2. Drop by our [community chat](https://owncast.rocket.chat/) if you'd like to be involved in more real-time discussion around Owncast to talk about this change.\n 3. Follow the project's getting started tips to make sure you can [build and run the project from source](https://owncast.online/development).\n\n ### Notes\n\n - Development takes place on the `develop` branch.\n - We use Storybook for testing and developing React components. `npm run storybook`. A hosted version [is available for viewing](https://owncast.online/components).\n - If you need to install the Go programming language to run the Owncast backend it's simple from [here](https://go.dev/dl/).\n - Active contributors get an Owncast t-shirt! Ask about it if you feel like you've been contributing and haven't yet been given one.\n\n ### New to Git?\n\n If you're brand new to Git you may want a short primer about the Fork -> Commit -> Pull Request workflow that enables changes to get made collaboratively using git. Visit the [First Contributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) project to learn step-by-step how to commit a change to a Git repository such as this one.", "PR up at #4413" ],

There is no need to use JavaScript on this issue, just plain CSS.\r\n*Note: You should only need to modify the `card.css` file.*\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/assets/82566656/f0244edc-6850-4b66-a668-e92e2e45955b\r\n\r\n### Colors\r\n\r\n-   Use `#ff9f00` for the color of the front-side of the card.\r\n-   Use `#4caf50` for the color of the back-side of the card.\r\n\r\n### Additional Resources\r\n\r\n-   [CSS Animations (MDN Web Docs)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Animations/Using_CSS_animations)\r\n-   [Cross-Browser Testing Tools](https://www.browserstack.com/)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you are using VS Code and have for example Live Server extension, you can simply open `card.html` with the server and check if the rotating effect looks similar as in the video. If it does, you are ready to make a pull request!\r\nIf you do not have Live Server extension, you'll find information about installing and how to use it [here](https://www.donskytech.com/visual-studio-code-live-server/).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions and how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

The actions-user bot will reset the file back to previous state for the next contributor after your commit is merged. So you can just simply start working with the issue right away!*\r\n\r\n### How to get started\r\n\r\nStart by opening the `tasks/django/easy` directory from the root of the project. \r\nThen open `hello_world/hello_world/urls.py` and `hello_world/hello_world_app/views.py` files and start working on your solution!\r\nNotice that there are `hello_world` and `hello_world_app` directories inside of `hello_world` directory which can make it a bit confusing. Make sure you are working with right folders and files!\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nYour task is to create a simple Django view that returns a \"Hello, World!\" message to the browser.\r\n-   You have to implement `/hello` path in `hello_world/hello_world/urls.py` file similar as the `/admin` path is implemented.\r\n\r\n![django-easy1](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/assets/82566656/7cb6279c-dac6-4d2a-9eb2-0cff988ef23b)\r\n-   Also, you have to add return statement inside `hello_world/hello_world_app/views.py` file, which will return the string \"Hello, World!\".\r\n\r\n![django-easy2](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/assets/82566656/1ce59ca3-eac2-4439-931f-57ea5799fd31)\r\n\r\n### How to Run:\r\n\r\n-   Make sure you are in `tasks/django/easy/hello_world` directory in your Terminal.\r\n-   Run the development server: `python manage.py runserver`\r\n-   Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/hello/` in your web browser.\r\n-   You should see \"Hello, World!\" displayed on the screen.\r\n\r\n### Before making a Pull request:\r\n\r\n-   Delete the `SECRET_KEY` in the `tasks/django/easy/hello_world/hello_world/settings.py` file. Otherwise when making the pull request, security checks will notice the secret and fail, which is not crucial because it can still be merged, but it just makes the Pull request experience a bit more enjoyable.\r\n- Normally these kind of projects would use something like `.env` file for storing secret keys and passwords etc in environment variables. In this project there is no need for that, since this is supposed to be just for educational purposes.\r\n- Remember, in real life projects, never expose the API keys, secret keys, any passwords or other environment variables to the public repository. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo work with this issue, you need to have Python and Django installed to your local machine.\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions of installing Python and Django. You can also find there instructions of how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

The actions-user bot will reset the file back to previous state for the next contributor after your commit is merged. So you can just simply start working with the issue right away!*\r\n\r\nOpen the `tasks/html/easy` directory from the root of your project.\r\n\r\nYour task is to insert an h1 tag with the name `John Doe` above the h2 tag in the `simple-tag.html` file.\r\n*Note: Only the `simple-tag.html` file needs modification for this task.*\r\n\r\n![html-easy](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/assets/82566656/d79136f8-a361-4ec5-a3d1-f70958954c58)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you are using VS Code and have for example Live Server extension, you can simply open `simple-tag.html` with the server and check how the page looks. After the task is done, you are ready to make a pull request!\r\nIf you do not have Live Server extension, you'll find information about installing and how to use it [here](https://www.donskytech.com/visual-studio-code-live-server/).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions and how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

See [this line](https://github.com/MCPJam/inspector/blob/main/client/src/hooks/helpers/types.ts#L3-L8) of code. \n2.

Add a tooltip to the buttons when you hover over them. Use the existing `TooltipTrigger` and `TooltipContent` components to achieve this. \n2. The buttons are in `ToolsTab.tsx`, specifically [these lines of code](https://github.com/MCPJam/inspector/blob/main/client/src/components/ToolsTab.tsx#L233-L268). \n3. Bonus points if you can refactor the ToolsTab component and make it more organized \n\n### First time contributing? \nPlease checkout our [CONTRIBUTIONS.md](https://github.com/MCPJam/inspector/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions on how to set up as a contributor.

So far, 11,939,962 scripts is been re-run with both Cek machines. Of 11 billion evaluations, around 200,000 evaluations are effected; this is ~2% of the all evaluations.\n\nBelow is the distribution of percent changes of these 200,000 evaluations: \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5a99bf0-aef7-4b64-87be-c679def308e4)\n\nSo, it's mostly 0~1% improvement. 2.86% is the maximum. Also, this only CPU budget; memory budget did not change at all. Note, these points are evaluation, not unique validators; some validators were evaluated multiple times with different script contexts. \n\nThe result makes sense. If `equalsData` is used to check equality of data-encoded datatype, like comparing equality of `TxOutRef`, the assumption is that the structure of them are identical, so it needs to go over all values making no changes to the cost. The only use case where new costing would benefit is where validator is comparing two different arbitrary data where at least one has an unknown structure. In real world validator, source of this datum of unknown structure would be `Datum` and `Redeemer`, but most validator would compare `Datum` or `Redeemer` to be equal with some set value and fail if they are not equal. This means, the only  scripts that benefits from this costing changes are the ones that expects its `Datum` or `Redeemer` to be not equal to some set value, which is pretty rare as shown." ],

React generator has at least one integration test  \n- ??? Generated React code integrates into a functional React component  \n- ??? Integration test runs successfully in the CI pipeline  \n- ??? The test adheres to the CLI's integration test pattern\n\n---\n\n### Additional Notes\n\nThis test ensures that the React generator produces code that works correctly in a modern front-end stack and helps prevent regressions related to JSX integration or runtime behavior.\n",

This could be useful since ide can autocomplete the signature of methods when overloading one.\r\n\r\nSomething like\r\n```py\r\nclass TypeCheckResource:\r\n  \"\"\"Superclass of a Resource for typing purposes\"\"\"\r\n  if TYPE_CHECKING:\r\n    def on_get(self, req: Request, resp: Response, **path_args: Any) -> None:\r\n      \"\"\"Handles the GET method\"\"\"\r\n    ...\r\n```", ">  once the `add_route` call happens the class is already defined.\r\n\r\nTrue, but in the current implementation if that class had say:\r\n```py\r\nclass MyResource:\r\n    def on_get(self, req: str, bad: int)\r\n\r\napp.add_route(uri_template, MyResource())\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen it would still type check okay (and the IDE wouldn't complain), because there is currently no typing for `resource` in:\r\nhttps://github.com/falconry/falcon/blob/4910dd73ecd1b9c8cf6cae045b26ad432fa56128/falcon/routing/compiled.py#L150\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nA super class (or even better an [ABC](https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html)) would work,\r\nbut it would require* everyone to explicitly to [`register`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html#abc.ABCMeta.register) (or subclass) `TypeCheckResource`.\r\n\r\n\\* assuming the goal would be to change the signature of `add_route` to ?????? , so that is type checked correctly.\r\n```py\r\ndef add_route(self, uri_template: str, resource: TypeCheckResource,...\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe nice thing about protocols is that we could add the `resource: Resource` type to `add_route` and no one would _have_* to change their code, except in the case that:\r\n1. They already have type annotations in their resource class, and:\r\n2. Those type annotations are incorrect.\r\n\r\nPut another way: it would allow graceful adoption of typing, without forcing everyone to do it.\r\n\r\n\\* incidentally protocols do also allow for [explicitly declaring an implementation](https://peps.python.org/pep-0544/#explicitly-declaring-implementation) if someone wanted to verify the types of a resource class before they tried to use it in `add_route`.\r\n\r\n... but that's all academic until/unless https://github.com/python/typing/issues/601 happens \uD83D\uDE11 ", "I'll try to help with it :)", "I can work on this issue", "@zodecky that sounds great!\r\nLet's just check with Ond??ej V??zner, @VOndrej42 do you have any code left from the Sprint in Prague maybe?", "Here's all the stubs I've collected, if it helps:\r\nhttps://github.com/JEFuller/falcon-types\r\n\r\n", "Thanks for sharing @davetapley :+1: \r\n\r\nOn that note, could you test Falcon [`4.0.0b2`](https://pypi.org/project/falcon/4.0.0b2/) out of the box without any other additional hints or typeshed packages for Falcon, and see if it works with your app?", "@vytas7 amazing, looks good, a few issues incoming, but regardless thanks for all the hard work \uD83D\uDE4F\uD83C\uDFFB " ],

      "description" : "When a project uses `.pyc` imports, the source may not exist. In that case, when there are no analyzable source or stubs available, we probably shouldn't return an error on imports that can't be resolved, since we can't do the usual trick of inferring type annotations from unannotated code. There is no decompiled code for us to use!\n\nInstead, we should use this logic: when we see a `<file>.pyc` import, but no non-`pyc` candidate, we should automatically perform the work of `replace_import_with_any`.\n\nWe'll likely want to do that by updating the [`FindResult`](https://github.com/facebook/pyrefly/blob/fffb8477b0ce8d4cb4eff311db2589fa3564c90d/pyrefly/lib/module/finder.rs#L33) to add a new variant for `.pyc` results, which when searching are lower precedence than `.pyi`, but higher than `NamespacePackages`.\n\nWe should also update the [configuration documentation](https://github.com/facebook/pyrefly/blob/fffb8477b0ce8d4cb4eff311db2589fa3564c90d/website/docs/configuration.mdx?plain=1#L265) to mention that we do this, since this behavior might be unexpected.\n\n---\n\nYou can test this yourself with the following: \n1. `uv venv venv && source venv/bin/activate && pip install requests && cd $(python3 -c \"import site; print(site.gesitepackages()[0])\")/requests`\n    - Note: this attempts to cd into the site directory that `requests` was installed into. If it was the wrong site package directory, then inspect other `site.getsitepackages()` directories to find the `requests` directory.\n2. `python3 -m compileall *`\n    - Note: you can also have the same effect as this by passing in `--compile` to `pip install requests`\n4. `rm *.py && mv __pycache__/* . && rm -rf __pycache__`\n5. `python3 -c 'import os; [os.rename(file, \".\".join([part for part in file.split(\".\") if \"cpython\" not in part])) for file in os.listdir()]'`\n\nThe above should set up requests to look like a compiled library.",

(Currently running on EVO192 with 6.5 - not encrypted FW)\r\nNow upgrade request, no additional configuration of 150+ needed\r\n\r\nCopying the screenshot of it\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106034385/228909855-4b88928e-ae2a-49fe-9557-d3ce687094db.png)\r\n\r\nSo this is a dedicated firmware v5.06.016 for ip150+ with support with all the new panels and firmware.\r\n\r\nThe only thing you should do is to enter \"special firmware access code \"IP150PCN\" durring the upgrade process of IP150+.\r\nIt is possible from inField and Paradox Gold App.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106034385/228911586-9e00432f-bc9f-4516-9c43-352ce4164777.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106034385/228911614-f29d0b41-9496-4bb0-aeb4-e5c5f15ee27a.png)\r\n\r\nin the Paradox Gold App is available in installer section\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106034385/228911768-7d9caee5-71bf-4e05-be51-4bc39157112e.png)\r\n\r\nStatement from paradox!\r\nUse the \"IP150PCN\" beta key to downgrade the module to v.5.06.016 for closed network operation.\r\nv5.06.016 has a web interface for network setup.

      "comments" : [ "# :wave: Important: PLEASE READ :wave:\n\nThis issue has been labeled as a **good first issue** and is available for anyone to work on.\n\nIf this is your first time contributing to an open source project, some aspects of the development process may seem unusual, arcane, or some combination of both.\n\n1.  **You cannot \"claim\" issues.** People new to open source often want to \"claim\" or be assigned an issue before beginning work. The typical rationale is that people want to avoid wasted work in the event that someone else ends up working the issue. However, this practice is not effective in open source, as it often leads to \"issue squatting\", in which an individual asks to be assigned, is granted their request, and then never ends up working on the issue. Accordingly, you are encouraged to communicate your intent to address this issue, ideally by providing a rough outline as to how you plan to address the issue or asking clarifying questions, but, at the end of the day, we will take running code and rough consensus in order to move forward quickly.\n2.  **We have a very high bar for contributions.** We have very high standards for contributions and expect all contributions???whether new features, tests, or documentation???to be rigorous, thorough, and complete. Once a pull request is merged into stdlib, that contribution immediately becomes the collective responsibility of all maintainers of stdlib. When we merge code into stdlib, we are saying that we, the maintainers, commit to reviewing subsequent changes and making bugfixes to the code. Hence, in order to ensure future maintainability, this naturally leads to a higher standard of contribution.\n\nBefore working on this issue and opening a pull request, please read the project's [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md). These guidelines and the associated [development guide](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/docs/contributing/development.md) provide important information, including links to stdlib's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), license policy, and steps for setting up your local development environment.\n\nTo reiterate, we **strongly** encourage you to refer to our contributing guides **before** beginning work on this issue. Failure to follow our guidelines significantly decreases the likelihood that you'll successfully contribute to stdlib and may result in automatic closure of a pull request without review.\n\nSetting up your local development environment is a critical first step, as doing so ensures that automated development processes for linting, license verification, and unit testing can run prior to authoring commits and pushing changes. If you would prefer to avoid manual setup, we provide pre-configured [development containers](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/tree/develop/.devcontainer) for use locally or in GitHub Codespaces.\n\nWe place a high value on consistency throughout the stdlib codebase. We encourage you to closely examine other packages in stdlib and attempt to emulate the practices and conventions found therein.\n\n-   If you are attempting to contribute a new package, sometimes the best approach is to simply copy the contents of an existing package and then modify the minimum amount necessary to implement the feature (e.g., changing descriptions, parameter names, and implementation).\n-   If you are contributing tests, find a package implementing a similar feature and emulate the tests of that package.\n-   If you are updating documentation, examine several similar packages and emulate the content, style, and prose of those packages.\n\nIn short, the more effort you put in to ensure that your contribution looks and feels like stdlib???including variables names, bracket spacing, line breaks, etc???the more likely that your contribution will be reviewed and ultimately accepted. We encourage you to closely study the codebase **before** beginning work on this issue.\n\n:sparkles: Thank you again for your interest in stdlib, and we look forward to reviewing your future contributions. :sparkles:\n" ],

reading messages from a Pub/Sub subscription (with `beam.io.gcp.pubsub.ReadFromPubSub`), parsing the records and then writing to BigQuery with:\n\n```python\n        parsed_messages | \"Write to BigQuery\" >> beam.io.WriteToBigQuery(\n            table=FULL_TABLE_ID,\n            schema=TABLE_SCHEMA,\n            write_disposition=beam.io.BigQueryDisposition.WRITE_APPEND,\n            method=beam.io.WriteToBigQuery.Method.STORAGE_WRITE_API,\n            with_auto_sharding=True,\n        )\n```\n\nUsing `apache-beam==2.66.0` with the DataflowRunner on a streaming pipeline with the `streaming_mode_at_least_once` mode. We're using a custom dataflow image following the instructions in the [docs](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/build-container-image). \n\nFrom my testing setting `with_auto_sharding` to False still resulted in the the errors I posted in the comment above. One arg for `WriteToBigQuery` that seemed to reduce the frequency of the errors was to set `triggering_frequency` to a value above 5 seconds. I also set some custom metric counters and it doesn't appear that we're loosing any data as the retries by the workers are working and all the streaming data is landing in the BigQuery sink.\n\nLet me know if there's anything else that would be helpful or steps I can take, thanks!\n\n" ],

      "description" : "### What happened?\r\n\r\n![???????????? 2024-10-27 172423](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67362294-40c0-4af6-a4e9-40b06f9ec9e8)\r\nBased on the concept of `resizePolicy`, it is expected behavior that `resizePolicy` cannot be assigned to ephemeral containers, as they do not support resource requests or limits.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the Kubernetes v1.31 API documentation, there is no clear indication that the `resizePolicy` option is disallowed for ephemeral containers, which may lead to confusion for users.\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c480ec78-4c3d-4190-8339-e10e03bed9ca)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/10b178ba-299b-4e06-a9dc-aa139851cbb6)\r\n\r\n### `pkg/apis/core/validation/validation_test.go`\r\n```go\r\nfunc TestValidateEphemeralContainers(t *testing.T) {\r\n...\r\n...\r\n...\r\n\t{\r\n\t\t\t\"Container uses disallowed field: ResizePolicy\",\r\n\t\t\tline(),\r\n\t\t\t[]core.EphemeralContainer{{\r\n\t\t\t\tEphemeralContainerCommon: core.EphemeralContainerCommon{\r\n\t\t\t\t\tName:                     \"resources-resize-policy\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\tImage:                    \"image\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\tImagePullPolicy:          \"IfNotPresent\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\tTerminationMessagePolicy: \"File\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\tResizePolicy: []core.ContainerResizePolicy{\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t{ResourceName: \"cpu\", RestartPolicy: \"NotRequired\"},\r\n\t\t\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t\t}},\r\n\t\t\tfield.ErrorList{{Type: field.ErrorTypeForbidden, Field: \"ephemeralContainers[0].resizePolicy\"}},\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t...\r\n\t...\r\n\t...\r\n```\r\nAs shown in the code above, it is explicitly stated that `resizePolicy` cannot be assigned to ephemeral containers.\r\nThis restriction is not reflected in the API documentation, potentially leading users to believe they can apply `resizePolicy` to ephemeral containers. Including this limitation in the documentation would improve clarity and enhance the user experience.\r\n\r\n### What did you expect to happen?\r\n\r\nThe Kubernetes v1.31 API documentation should clearly state that `resizePolicy` cannot be assigned to ephemeral containers, as they do not support resource requests or limits. This clarification would prevent users from mistakenly assuming that `resizePolicy` can be applied to ephemeral containers and help avoid configuration errors.\r\n\r\n### How can we reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)?\r\n\r\n1. Go to the Kubernetes v1.31 API documentation.\r\n2. [Navigate to the section discussing `resizePolicy` for containers.](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.31/#containerresizepolicy-v1-core)\r\n3. [Review the documentation regarding ephemeral containers.](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.31/#ephemeralcontainer-v1-core)\r\n4. Observe that there is no mention or clarification that `resizePolicy` cannot be applied to ephemeral containers, leading to potential misunderstandings.\r\n\r\n### Anything else we need to know?\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Kubernetes version\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ kubectl version\r\nClient Version: v1.31.1\r\nKustomize Version: v5.4.2\r\nServer Version: v1.31.1\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n\r\n### Cloud provider\r\n\r\n<details>\r\nOn-Premises\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### OS version\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n```console\r\n# On Linux:\r\n$ cat /etc/os-release\r\nRETTY_NAME=\"Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS\"\r\nNAME=\"Ubuntu\"\r\nVERSION_ID=\"22.04\"\r\nVERSION=\"22.04.4 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)\"\r\nVERSION_CODENAME=jammy\r\nID=ubuntu\r\nID_LIKE=debian\r\nHOME_URL=\"https://www.ubuntu.com/\"\r\nSUPPORT_URL=\"https://help.ubuntu.com/\"\r\nBUG_REPORT_URL=\"https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/\"\r\nPRIVACY_POLICY_URL=\"https://www.ubuntu.com/legal/terms-and-policies/privacy-policy\"\r\nUBUNTU_CODENAME=jammy\r\n\r\n$ uname -a\r\nLinux masternode-virtual-machine 6.8.0-47-generic #47~22.04.1-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Wed Oct  2 16:16:55 UTC 2 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n\r\n### Install tools\r\n\r\n<details>\r\nkubeadm\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n\r\n### Container runtime (CRI) and version (if applicable)\r\n\r\n<details>\r\ncontainerd\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n\r\n### Related plugins (CNI, CSI, ...) and versions (if applicable)\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n",

Add keyboard shortcut handler in `ChatApp.tsx`:\n  ```tsx\n  // In the existing handleKeyDown function\n  if ((e.metaKey || e.ctrlKey) && e.key === 'Backspace') {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    if (currentSessionId && !isWelcomeState) {\n      // Trigger same deletion flow as SessionPanel delete button\n      // Show confirmation dialog for sessions with messages\n    }\n  }\n```\n  2. Update shortcuts modal in ChatApp.tsx:\n\n```tsx\n  // Add to existing shortcuts array\n  { key: isMac ? '??????' : 'Ctrl+???', desc: 'Delete current session' }\n```\n  3. Handle deletion logic:\n\n  - Use existing deleteSession function from ChatContext\n  - Implement same confirmation dialog as SessionPanel\n  - Return to welcome state after deletion\n\n  Files to modify\n\n  - src/app/webui/components/ChatApp.tsx (keyboard handler + shortcuts modal)\n  - Test the functionality matches existing delete behavior\n\n  UX Considerations\n\n  - Should follow same confirmation flow as existing delete buttons\n  - Shortcut only active when there's a current session (not in welcome state)\n  - Clear feedback when deletion completes\n\n  This improves workflow by allowing quick session deletion without opening the sessions panel.\n\n## Testing Steps\n\nrefer `src/app/webui/README.md` for steps to set up the webUI locally for testing\n",

Pinging a server actually shows up in the activity pane, but it's not obvious that happens. \n\n## How to fix\n1. We want to automatically open the History pane every time the user clicks ping \n2. This logic lives in `History.tsx`\n3. Paste the following in `History.tsx`: \n```\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const lastRequest = requestHistory[requestHistory.length - 1].request;\n    const lastRequestMethod = JSON.parse(lastRequest).method;\n    if (lastRequestMethod && lastRequestMethod === \"ping\") {\n      setIsHistoryCollapsed(false);\n    }\n  }, [requestHistory]);\n```\n4. What this does is it listens for request histories. If the most recent action is a ping, we want to open up the history pane. This works, but its a bit hacky. Feel free to improve the logic, but you can also just submit as is. ",

When you install the control plane and the data plane in the same cluster, the default data plane points to the same K8s cluster. \n\nYou can optionally use a different Kubernetes (K8s) cluster and refer to it in your default data plane. \n\n#### BuildPlane `default`\nWe introduced the BuildPlane concept in https://github.com/openchoreo/openchoreo/issues/217#issuecomment-2917158174.

Each transformation function returns a pandas.Series:\n\n\n\nWhen I run this code with scikit-learn 1.6, I get the following error:\n\nAfter investigation, I found that the issue occurs because each transformer returns a Series, not a DataFrame. If I update the functions to return DataFrame objects instead, the error disappears.\n\nInterestingly, in scikit-learn 1.4, the same code works correctly even when the functions return Series.\n\n\nDo you have any explanation for why this changed between version 1.4 and 1.6 ?\n\nThanks in advance for your help!\n\n### Steps/Code to Reproduce\n\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import FunctionTransformer, FeatureUnion\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef compute_cumulative_mean_age(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:\n    return (\n        df[\"age\"]\n        .astype(float)\n        .groupby(df[\"id\"])\n        .expanding()\n        .mean()\n        .droplevel(level=\"id\")\n        .reindex(df.index)\n        .rename(\"cumulative_mean_age\")\n    )\n\ndef compute_cumulative_mean_weight(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:\n    return (\n        df[\"poids\"]\n        .astype(float)\n        .groupby(df[\"id\"])\n        .expanding()\n        .mean()\n        .droplevel(level=\"id\")\n        .reindex(df.index)\n        .rename(\"cumulative_mean_weight\")\n    )\n\ndef compute_features(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:\n    feature_union = FeatureUnion(\n        [\n            (\"cumulative_mean_age\", FunctionTransformer(compute_cumulative_mean_age)),\n            (\"cumulative_mean_weight\", FunctionTransformer(compute_cumulative_mean_weight))\n        ]\n    ).set_output(transform=\"pandas\")\n\n    return feature_union.fit_transform(X=df).astype(float)\n\ndef transform(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:\n    return compute_features(df)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    np.random.seed(42)\n    df = pd.DataFrame({\n        'id': [1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8],\n        'age': np.random.randint(18, 70, size=10),\n        'poids': np.random.randint(50, 100, size=10)\n    })\n\n    print(transform(df))\n```\n\n### Expected Results\n\n```pytb\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"C:\\Users\\XXX\\PycharmProjects\\fraude_detection_pec_audio\\tmp.py\", line 73, in <module>\n    print(transform(df=df))\n          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"C:\\Users\\XXX\\PycharmProjects\\fraude_detection_pec_audio\\tmp.py\", line 55, in transform\n    return compute_features(\n           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"C:\\Users\\XXX\\PycharmProjects\\fraude_detection_pec_audio\\tmp.py\", line 45, in compute_features\n    .fit_transform(\n     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"C:\\Users\\XXX\\PycharmProjects\\fraude_detection_pec_audio\\.venv\\Lib\\site-packages\\sklearn\\utils\\_set_output.py\", line 332, in wrapped\n    return _wrap_data_with_container(method, data_to_wrap, X, self)\n           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"C:\\Users\\XXX\\PycharmProjects\\fraude_detection_pec_audio\\.venv\\Lib\\site-packages\\sklearn\\utils\\_set_output.py\", line 307, in _wrap_data_with_container\n    return adapter.create_container(\n           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"C:\\Users\\XXX\\PycharmProjects\\fraude_detection_pec_audio\\.venv\\Lib\\site-packages\\sklearn\\utils\\_set_output.py\", line 135, in create_container\n    X_output = _create_pandas_dataframe_from_non_pandas_container(\n               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"C:\\Users\\XXX\\PycharmProjects\\fraude_detection_pec_audio\\.venv\\Lib\\site-packages\\sklearn\\utils\\fixes.py\", line 428, in _create_pandas_dataframe_from_non_pandas_container\n    return pd.DataFrame(X, index=index, copy=copy)\n           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"C:\\Users\\XXX\\PycharmProjects\\fraude_detection_pec_audio\\.venv\\Lib\\site-packages\\pandas\\core\\frame.py\", line 722, in __init__\n    mgr = ndarray_to_mgr(\n          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"C:\\Users\\XXX\\PycharmProjects\\fraude_detection_pec_audio\\.venv\\Lib\\site-packages\\pandas\\core\\internals\\construction.py\", line 349, in ndarray_to_mgr\n    _check_values_indices_shape_match(values, index, columns)\n  File \"C:\\Users\\XXX\\PycharmProjects\\fraude_detection_pec_audio\\.venv\\Lib\\site-packages\\pandas\\core\\internals\\construction.py\", line 420, in _check_values_indices_shape_match\n    raise ValueError(f\"Shape of passed values is {passed}, indices imply {implied}\")\nValueError: Shape of passed values is (20, 1), indices imply (10, 1)\n```\n\n### Actual Results\n\n```pytb\n    raise ValueError(f\"Shape of passed values is {passed}, indices imply {implied}\")\nValueError: Shape of passed values is (20, 1), indices imply (10, 1)\n```\n\n### Versions\n\n```shell\nsklearn: 1.6.0\nnumpy: 1.26.4\npandas: 1.5.3\n```",

      "comments" : [ "I would argue that the previous beahviour worked by chance but it was a bug. Scikit-learn transformers API expect to return an array of shape `(n_samples, n_features)`. Having a single dimension is really ambiguous because we cannot guess if it is a single sample or a single feature. For instance, if you use `set_output(transform=\"default\")`, then you will get an array of shape `(20,)` where I would argue that the `FeatureUnion` failed.\n\nSo here, I think that the fact that we raise an error is actually fine. The error message is a bit tricky thought. The fact it does not raise with `set_output(transform=\"default\")` is actually annoying I think.\n\nSo one way would be to validate the output of `FunctionTransformer` being sure it should be 2-D. However, we sometime want this transformer to be lenient so I wonder if the behaviour should be driven by a parameter, similarly to the `validate` parameter but for the output.", "@jeremiedbb @ogrisel do you have any thoughts regarding if `FunctionTransformer` should be permissive regarding the shape of the output or if we should strictly follow the API of other transformers.\n\nI'm thinking that we usually want this transformer to be permissive on the input side.", "Note that the mentioned code already raises 2 informative warnings before raising the final exception:\n\n```python\n/Users/ogrisel/code/scikit-learn/sklearn/preprocessing/_function_transformer.py:311: UserWarning: When `set_output` is configured to be 'pandas', `func` should return a pandas DataFrame to follow the `set_output` API  or `feature_names_out` should be defined.\n  warnings.warn(warn_msg.format(\"pandas\"))\n/Users/ogrisel/code/scikit-learn/sklearn/preprocessing/_function_transformer.py:311: UserWarning: When `set_output` is configured to be 'pandas', `func` should return a pandas DataFrame to follow the `set_output` API  or `feature_names_out` should be defined.\n  warnings.warn(warn_msg.format(\"pandas\"))\n```\n\nThe function transformer should not return a pandas series but a pandas dataframe.\n\nMaybe we could change this to accept series and automatically wrap them as dataframes because there is no ambiguity in this particular case.\n\nIf not, I agree that we should at least improve the error message.\n\nLet me try to simplify the reproducer to make it minimal.", "Here is a minimal reproducer:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import FunctionTransformer\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import FeatureUnion\n\n\ndata = pd.DataFrame(dict(a=range(3), b=range(3)))\nFeatureUnion(\n    [\n        (\"a\", FunctionTransformer(lambda df: df[\"a\"])),\n        (\"b\", FunctionTransformer(lambda df: df[\"b\"])),  # exception not raised if you remove this line.\n    ]\n).set_output(transform=\"pandas\").fit_transform(data)\n```\n\nNote that the `FeatureUnion` requires 2 series, otherwise there are no exceptions, only the warnings.", "Actually, here is the real bug in my opinion: if you remove the `.set_output(\"pandas\")` from the above snippet, the code works without failing or raising warnings but outputs meaningless results:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import FunctionTransformer\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import FeatureUnion\n\n\ndata = pd.DataFrame(dict(a=range(3), b=range(3)))\nFeatureUnion(\n    [\n        (\"a\", FunctionTransformer(lambda df: df[\"a\"])),\n        (\"b\", FunctionTransformer(lambda df: df[\"b\"])),\n    ]\n).fit_transform(data)\n```\n```\narray([0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2])\n```\n\nInstead, `FeatureUnion` should raise an explicit error message to make it explicit that some transformers output 1d data-structures instead of the expected 2d.", "I think the `FeatureUnion._hstack` method should be changed to raise an informative error message if some elements in `Xs` are not 2D data-structures. We should also check that their `.shape[0]` match the expected number of samples measured on the `X` parameter passed to `FeatureUnion.transform` or `FeatureUnion.fit_transform`.\n\nEDIT: the error message of the exception should mention the name of the transformer that generated invalid output shapes along with the observed shape and the expected number of data points.", "hello i am Ahsan , i am new to open source , i would like to contribute .", "/take" ],

      "description" : "RASTER.createRaster() allows **kwargs, but if I am not mistaken, the kwargs are not processed in the method itself. This creates the problem that false args can be passed which then disappear unnoticed with as kwargs, and not only directly to createRaster() but also to createRasterLike() where the matter is much more critically as this method essentially depends on relevant kwargs. Example: When you have a ```data``` array with floats between 0.5 and 1.5 and save it as such:\n```python\ngk.raster.createRasterLike(\n    source=\"SOME_RASTER.tiff\",\n    data=data,\n    output=\"THE_NEW_RASTER.tiff\",\n    dType=float\n)\n```\nyou will not get any notification yet save a raster full of ones (1) instead of the correct float values since the arg should have been ```dtype=float``` instead of ```dType=float```. This is hard to find and usually too late.\nThis issue was originally created by: @chrisjwin",

      "description" : "<!--\nThank you for suggesting a new recipe for OpenRewrite!\nFeel free to delete any sections that don't apply to your request.\n-->\n\n## What problem are you trying to solve?\n\nGradle recommends using lazy task registration (tasks.register(...)) over eager task creation (task ...) to avoid unnecessary initialization during the configuration phase, which can improve build performance and is better aligned with modern Gradle best practices. IntelliJ IDEA does offer autofix suggestions for this change, but only on a per-line basis???mass cleanup across a project is not supported via code suggestions.\n\n## What precondition(s) should be checked before applying this recipe?\n\nNone???this change can be applied universally across all Gradle versions that support the tasks.register(...) syntax.\n\n## Describe the situation before applying the recipe\n\n```groovy\ntask allDeps(type: DependencyReportTask)\n```\n\nor\n\n```groovy\ntask allDeps(type: DependencyReportTask) { \n     group = 'reporting'\n     description = '...'\n     // additional configuration\n}\n```\n\n## Describe the situation after applying the recipe\n\n```groovy\ntasks.register(\"allDeps\", DependencyReportTask)\n```\n\nor\n\n```groovy\ntasks.register(\"allDeps\", DependencyReportTask) { \n     group = 'reporting'\n     description = '...'\n     // additional configuration\n}\n```\n\n## Have you considered any alternatives or workarounds?\n\nThis can be done manually or line-by-line using IntelliJ's quick fixes, but there is currently no automated way to perform this change across an entire codebase or multiple projects.\n\n## Any additional context\n\nThis change aligns with modern Gradle practices. While IntelliJ offers autofixes for single lines, a recipe in OpenRewrite would enable automated and large-scale migration of legacy Gradle scripts to use lazy task registration. It should be relatively straightforward to implement when needed.\n\n## Are you interested in [contributing this recipe to OpenRewrite](https://github.com/openrewrite/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-new-recipes)?\n\nNot at this time, unless prompted by customer need.\n",

I would love to be proven wrong). We would need to migrate to a self-hosted git server to do that. So, cool idea, but not happening.\r\n\r\nAdding a check to CI is the only possibility I can think of. This isn't ideal because we're using a shared repo (instead of keeping separate personal forks) so once a problem file hits CI it's already in the repo and will affect everyone. But we can make it choke if your branch introduces (or has? subtle distinction) a large file in it, and have it tell you to rebase it away.\r\n\r\nOnce a file is rebased away (and it has to be [truly gone](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository) -- from all branches and the `reflog` too and everyone's local copies) then `git gc` should clean it up. There's built in grace periods so it will take a while -- up to a month -- to naturally delete, but you can override them with `git reflog expire --expire=now --all` and `git gc --prune=now` and hopefully if you introduce a problem file CI can catch it before any one else checks out the branch.\r\n\r\nAdding a check in Github Actions might be even better, because github actions can run on all sorts of events; it would be ideal if an Action would let us reject a push.\r\n\r\n", "I'm very pro the Actions workflow method!

Thank you!", "@alvaromartmart are you still looking for help on this?", "@peterlazzarino I am!\r\nWhile the current state of the definition file suits my needs, there are some tasks I would like to work on at some point:\r\n> Disclaimer: As I stated on the OP, I wrote the definition file based on the official documentation, mostly. At some points I went to the code to better understand some things that were not clear to me, but 95% was me *trusting* that the documentation is up to date with the implementation.\r\n- [ ] Reviewing the current definitions. Maybe not thoroughly, but I don't use the whole range of OpenSeadragon features, so there are things I might have missed:\r\n    - [ ] There are a lot of methods/constructors with optional parameters, which in my head translates to several function signatures. I tried to include as many supported signatures in the definition file, but some may be missing.\r\n    - [ ] I don't consider myself the greatest js developer in the world, so feedback is welcome. For instance, I'm not always sure when to use an interface over a type aliases. \r\n- [x] There are no tests. I have not investigated yet the proper way to write ts definition file tests.\r\n- [ ] There is just one big declaration file, it may be a good idea to spread it between several, feature-related files, and export them all together.\r\n- [ ] OSD plugins support: I have not used any plugins yet and have not looked into how they are implemented, so I am not sure how easy it will be to include plugin definitions too.\r\n\r\nLooking further down the road:\r\n* I think including the code documentation in the definition file would be great, as we would be getting intellisense in VSCode and others, making it much easier to work with OpenSeadragon.\r\n* Publishing the definition file to DefinitelyTyped, or including it on the OpenSeadragon repo itself.\r\n\r\nSo the TL; DR version is: anyone willing to help with this stuff, feel free to contact me, I'm open for collaborators ;) ", "Very helpful!

Should there be a process for updating the types?", "@alvaromartmart thank you for making a PR with the installation instructions; I'll get that deployed soon.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts on how we should maintain the types going forward?\r\n\r\nI'm working with @Dan503 on an OpenSeadragon-based comic viewer using TypeScript, and he had a few bits he needed to add to our local copy of the definitions. You can see those changes here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pixfabrik/driftory-viewer/pull/5/commits/350b5560a363b76707ceb0c273bc04b134702dbe\r\n\r\nDoes that seem like a reasonable change to make to the \"official\" version? How do we go about that? A new PR on https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped?", "> Does that seem like a reasonable change to make to the \"official\" version?\r\n\r\nThe exact change I made was more of a quick hack to just do the bare minimum to get my copy working so it could probably be better. I don't have enough seadragon or typescript knowledge to do a quality fix. The types in the official version should get fixed though.\r\n\r\n> How do we go about that? A new PR\r\n\r\nPersonally I think it would be easier to just manually maintain a local `.d.ts` file as part of this repository rather than make PRs against the `@types` library. \r\n\r\nIt would automatically get downloaded when users npm install OpenSeadragon. \r\n\r\nAlso, if you ever make changes to the API, updating the types is as simple as updating the local file as part of the API changes. No need to make a PR against a third party repository that you don't have control over.", "> Personally I think it would be easier to just manually maintain a local .d.ts file as part of this repository rather than make PRs against the @types library.\r\n\r\nThat does sound appealing! I don't know enough about the TypeScript ecosystem to know if that's a common scenario. @alvaromartmart any thoughts on that?", "Yes, I think that would be much better than having to keep the types at DefinitelyTyped in sync (specially considering that OpenSeadragon releases patch versions, and DefinitelyTyped [only considers minor versions](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped#how-do-definitely-typed-package-versions-relate-to-versions-of-the-corresponding-library) in order to determine which types correspond to the library version ).\r\n\r\nWhen I have the time I'll take a look at the missing types @iangilman mentioned (sorry, I forgot about it). And I can investigate a bit more about what would imply adding the type definitions to the repo (I'm specially concerned about plugins support, but I have to check first)", "@alvaromartmart (and anyone else here interested) maybe it's time to revisit moving the TypeScript definitions into this repository?

This is available from the page menu button on the left side of the location bar. I personally forget it exists, but it is a no-code solution.

[Craig Hockenberry explains how to use it in CSS](https://furbo.org/2024/07/04/dynamic-type-on-the-web/). Android also has such a setting, so I wonder if browsers can offer that to pages or if they do it automatically. This would be really nice, but only after bringing text size in line with common body text.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: I set my system text size up to 120%, so lots of sites' text looks small to me. However, text on Lobsters looks smaller than most.", "@pushcx I'm starting work on this. My proposed solution is to make the entire div which covers the both the arrow and the score clickable. That combined area is about 30px which is good enough, in contrast to the arrow alone which is 18px.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that anyone who clicks on that area wants to make a vote so it'll not obstruct any other user actions. I'll send a PR soon.", "That sounds like a great approach, I look forward to your PR. I think you'll have to make the `div` and `a` to keep it working without javascript.", "This [article on accessible fonts](https://accessibe.com/blog/knowledgebase/ada-compliant-fonts#character-size) recommends \"A safe bet for a WCAG-conforming font size is 16px (or [1em](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/em) or [1rem](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/css-rem))\". (thanks to gj1118 on [today's office hours stream](https://push.cx/stream/2025-03-24))\n\nSimilar to how we have CSS variables for colors we reuse, we should define variables for our [font size scale](https://webtypography.net/3.1.1). The most important text on the site is the comment text, so we should pick a good size for that and pick every other size as a variation on it (headlines, bylines, header/footer, etc).\n\n@holsta suggested a quick experiement, we removed all the `font-size` declarations, most of the `line-height`, and the `.comment_text p { padding }` and the resulting page looked quite good. There's enough variation in color and spacing that the site structure was still obvious. \n\nThinking of #642 I tried moving the `comment_folder` underneath the score - the change is a bit jarring, but I think it could become comfortable with experience, it sort of fits semantically as a replacement for downvote, and it reclaims horizontal space that's especially precious on mobile.", "> The most important text on the site is the comment text, so we should pick a good size for that and pick every other size as a variation on it (headlines, bylines, header/footer, etc).\n\nI believe the most accessible and user-friendly option is to let the user dictate their preferred font size. As long as `font-size` isn't overwritten in the root element, rem units respect the browser setting for default font size. Comment text should probably have a size of 1rem while other text elements could have some other multiple of rem.\n\nThis [article on CSS units](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/surprising-truth-about-pixels-and-accessibility/) does a good job of explaining the issue, and it also presents some solutions to help adapt to rem units.", "That sounds entirely reasonable.\n\nI did an experiment on an office hours stream a little while ago (no link handy, sorry) where I just deleted every `font-size` from the css and the site looked quite good! We don't use many variations in font size, and the ones we have may not communicate much." ],

      "description" : "### Issue Description\n\nI am trying to mount a podman secret as a file using kube play, however an error is being produced:\n`Error: failed to create volume \"my-volume\": error unmarshaling JSON: while decoding JSON: json: cannot unmarshal string into Go value of type v1.Secret`\n\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\n\nSteps to reproduce the issue - I am using rootless podman\n1. Create a text file: \n`echo \"My Secret File\" >> my_secret_file.txt`\n2. Create a secret from the file:\n`podman secret create my-secret-file ./my_secret_file.txt`\n3. Create a kube.yaml file: mytest.yaml\n```\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  annotations:\n  labels:\n    app: mytest\n  name: mytest\nspec:\n  containers:\n  - image: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9-minimal:latest\n    command: [\"sleep 1000\"]\n    name: app\n    securityContext:\n      runAsNonRoot: true\n    volumeMounts:\n    - mountPath: /my_secret_file.txt\n      name: my-volume\n  volumes:\n  - name: my-volume\n    secret:\n      secretName: my-secret-file\n```\n4. Run the file\n`podman kube play mytest.yaml`\n\n### Describe the results you received\n\nI received an error:\n\n```\nError: failed to create volume \"my-volume\": error unmarshaling JSON: while decoding JSON: json: cannot unmarshal string into Go value of type v1.Secret\n```\n\n### Describe the results you expected\n\nI would have expected for the pod/container to run and be able to look into the pod and see a file:\n`/my_secret_file.txt`\n\n### podman info output\n\n```yaml\nhost:\n  arch: amd64\n  buildahVersion: 1.39.4\n  cgroupControllers:\n  - memory\n  - pids\n  cgroupManager: systemd\n  cgroupVersion: v2\n  conmon:\n    package: conmon-2.1.12-1.el9.x86_64\n    path: /usr/bin/conmon\n    version: 'conmon version 2.1.12, commit: c0564282e9befb7804c3642230f8e94f1b2ba9f8'\n  cpuUtilization:\n    idlePercent: 97.94\n    systemPercent: 0.72\n    userPercent: 1.34\n  cpus: 8\n  databaseBackend: sqlite\n  distribution:\n    distribution: rhel\n    version: \"9.6\"\n  eventLogger: file\n  freeLocks: 2047\n  hostname: myhost.my.org\n  idMappings:\n    gidmap:\n    - container_id: 0\n      host_id: 894400513\n      size: 1\n    - container_id: 1\n      host_id: 231072\n      size: 65536\n    uidmap:\n    - container_id: 0\n      host_id: 894403853\n      size: 1\n    - container_id: 1\n      host_id: 231072\n      size: 65536\n  kernel: 5.14.0-570.21.1.el9_6.x86_64\n  linkmode: dynamic\n  logDriver: k8s-file\n  memFree: 6739845120\n  memTotal: 32990842880\n  networkBackend: netavark\n  networkBackendInfo:\n    backend: netavark\n    dns:\n      package: aardvark-dns-1.14.0-1.el9.x86_64\n      path: /usr/libexec/podman/aardvark-dns\n      version: aardvark-dns 1.14.0\n    package: netavark-1.14.1-1.el9_6.x86_64\n    path: /usr/libexec/podman/netavark\n    version: netavark 1.14.1\n  ociRuntime:\n    name: crun\n    package: crun-1.21-1.el9_6.x86_64\n    path: /usr/bin/crun\n    version: |-\n      crun version 1.21\n      commit: 10269840aa07fb7e6b7e1acff6198692d8ff5c88\n      rundir: /run/user/894403853/crun\n      spec: 1.0.0\n      +SYSTEMD +SELINUX +APPARMOR +CAP +SECCOMP +EBPF +CRIU +YAJL\n  os: linux\n  pasta:\n    executable: /usr/bin/pasta\n    package: passt-0^20250217.ga1e48a0-9.el9_6.x86_64\n    version: \"\"\n  remoteSocket:\n    exists: true\n    path: /run/user/894403853/podman/podman.sock\n  rootlessNetworkCmd: pasta\n  security:\n    apparmorEnabled: false\n    capabilities: CAP_CHOWN,CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE,CAP_FOWNER,CAP_FSETID,CAP_KILL,CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE,CAP_SETFCAP,CAP_SETGID,CAP_SETPCAP,CAP_SETUID,CAP_SYS_CHROOT\n    rootless: true\n    seccompEnabled: true\n    seccompProfilePath: /usr/share/containers/seccomp.json\n    selinuxEnabled: true\n  serviceIsRemote: false\n  slirp4netns:\n    executable: /usr/bin/slirp4netns\n    package: slirp4netns-1.3.2-1.el9.x86_64\n    version: |-\n      slirp4netns version 1.3.2\n      commit: 0f13345bcef588d2bb70d662d41e92ee8a816d85\n      libslirp: 4.4.0\n      SLIRP_CONFIG_VERSION_MAX: 3\n      libseccomp: 2.5.2\n  swapFree: 0\n  swapTotal: 0\n  uptime: 25h 10m 40.00s (Approximately 1.04 days)\n  variant: \"\"\nplugins:\n  authorization: null\n  log:\n  - k8s-file\n  - none\n  - passthrough\n  - journald\n  network:\n  - bridge\n  - macvlan\n  - ipvlan\n  volume:\n  - local\nregistries:\n  search:\n  - registry.access.redhat.com\n  - registry.redhat.io\n  - docker.io\nstore:\n  configFile: /home/bmwilli/.config/containers/storage.conf\n  containerStore:\n    number: 1\n    paused: 0\n    running: 1\n    stopped: 0\n  graphDriverName: overlay\n  graphOptions: {}\n  graphRoot: /var/lib/containers/users/bmwilli/storage\n  graphRootAllocated: 214639316992\n  graphRootUsed: 10743459840\n  graphStatus:\n    Backing Filesystem: xfs\n    Native Overlay Diff: \"true\"\n    Supports d_type: \"true\"\n    Supports shifting: \"false\"\n    Supports volatile: \"true\"\n    Using metacopy: \"false\"\n  imageCopyTmpDir: /var/tmp\n  imageStore:\n    number: 4\n  runRoot: /run/user/894403853/containers\n  transientStore: false\n  volumePath: /var/lib/containers/users/bmwilli/storage/volumes\nversion:\n  APIVersion: 5.4.0\n  Built: 1749033784\n  BuiltTime: Wed Jun  4 10:43:04 2025\n  GitCommit: \"\"\n  GoVersion: go1.23.9 (Red Hat 1.23.9-1.el9_6)\n  Os: linux\n  OsArch: linux/amd64\n  Version: 5.4.0\n```\n\n### Podman in a container\n\nNo\n\n### Privileged Or Rootless\n\nRootless\n\n### Upstream Latest Release\n\nNo\n\n### Additional environment details\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional information\n\nWhile this is a trivial example, the real use case is that we create podman secrets for a servers cert/key/ca and mount them into a container to be used.",

We need your help to make Ghostfolio fully accessible to Portuguese-speaking users!\r\n\r\nHere???s how you can participate in the translation work:\r\n\r\n1. Open the translation file at https://github.com/ghostfolio/ghostfolio/blob/main/apps/client/src/locales/messages.pt.xlf\r\n2. Search for entries with `state=\"new\"`\r\n3. Translate the content of the `<target>` element\r\n4. Change the state from `\"new\"` to `\"translated\"`\r\n5. Create a pull request with your translations\r\n\r\nYou don???t need to translate everything at once. Even small contributions are incredibly valuable and easier for us to review.\r\n\r\nYour efforts will make a big difference. Many thanks in advance for your help!",

Possible Implementation\r\n\r\nPlaces in the code that use `EntityRefLink`/`EntityRefLinks` are already covered.\r\n\r\nBut there's still a fair number of places that just plain render `metadata.name`, or use `humanizeEntityRef`, or use some custom logic like that. Those should generally try to use the `EntityDisplayName` React component if possible, or use `EntityPresentation.promise` when in non-React code (which becomes available after #24595 is merged).\r\n\r\nWe'd appreciate the help with digging through the Backstage core and plugins, finding places where the presentation API should be used.\r\n\r\n### \uD83D\uDC40 Have you spent some time to check if this feature request has been raised before?\r\n\r\n- [X] I checked and didn't find similar issue\r\n\r\n### \uD83C\uDFE2 Have you read the Code of Conduct?\r\n\r\n- [X] I have read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\r\n\r\n### Are you willing to submit PR?\r\n\r\nNo, but I'm happy to collaborate on a PR with someone else",

After reviewing the codebase, I have a couple of questions.\r\n\r\n- Since humanizeEntityRef is a function returning a string, how is it suggested to replace EntityDisplayName, which is a React component?\r\n- I have lookup the place using EntityDisplayName, but I can't figure out how it related to the usage of humanizeEntityRef.\r\n\r\nThank you for the patience!", "Hi!\r\n\r\nYeah as I alluded to in the issue description \"There are some cases where you aren't yet in a React tree\"; those cases may need some rewriting where possible (moving work out of a function and instead into a child helper component or similar), or if you find that this isn't working out at all, we'd like to see examples of those cases to see if there's something we should do to extend or alter the API interface to cater to those cases.\r\n\r\nEssentially, the _desired_ end result is that there's no custom rendering of `humanizeEntityRef` or plain `metadat.name` and similar anywhere. Getting all the way there may or may not need alterations to the presentation API.\r\n\r\nEDIT: https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/24595 adds the promise based API", "This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity.

Usually this occurs when an app is buggy and only sends the leaf certificate without its chain, and explicitly trusting the leaf's issuing intermediate CA seems to fix the problem for them. Crucially, when that intermediate is then rotated their app will break.\r\n\r\nWe could add a toggle, defaulting to false, such as `allowIntermediateCertificates`. If false, it would parse every certificate and ensure that it's self-signed. There might be other ways of achieving the same goal.\r\n\r\nHaving this in from the start could prevent so many misconfigurations by unsuspecting cluster admins.\r\n\r\n(Complication: If we added a list of publicly trusted certs it'd probably need to default to allowing intermediates in that list by default - but we could definitely default to disallowing intermediates everywhere else)",

      "description" : "Transmuting pointers, using `unsafe` sections, and padding elements to different cache lines is quite tricky in Rust, and not always straightforward & safe in C++ too. The following \"map-reduce\"-like operations can be introduced:\n\n```rs\npub fn try_map<T, U, F>(\n    &self,\n    inputs: &[T],\n    map: F,\n) -> Result<Vec<Padding64<U>, A>, ForkUnionError>\nwhere ...\n```\n\nThe full set of operations may include: `try_map`, `try_map_reduce`, `try_map_filter_reduce`. The `try_map_reduce` and `try_map_filter_reduce` should be much cheaper to run, than combining `try_map` with subsequent separate reduction. In optimized versions, we can keep just one \"folding reduction result\" privately per thread, and can be outputted into a smaller container the size of the thread pool - no the `inputs` container.\n\nRelevant considerations:\n\n- What kinds of `inputs` containers can be accepted, and have sub-linear iteration cost, so that we can cheaply split the work between multiple worker threads?\n- Should we use the same allocator with which the `ForkUnion` was created or allow passing an additional one for the exported execution results?\n- For non-flat `inputs`, should the method be called `try_flat_map`?\n",

Computing the full inverse matrix is computationally expensive and somewhat contradictory to the iterative sparse methods we???re testing.\n\nCould you suggest an alternative approach for `error_est`?\nFor example, I???m considering replacing it with a simpler, lightweight estimate such as:\n\n`error_est = {some num > 0}* n1 * n2`\n", "This is an error estimate based on the maximum absolute value of the inverse matrix. It could read in fact\n```python\nerror_est = np.linalg.norm(Bmat.flat, np.inf)\n```\nwhich is the inf-norm of the vectorized matrix. This does not seem to give a sharp estimate, given that it is multiplied by a small number just below (`tol = 1e-5`). Maybe @jowezarek could shed some light on this?", "@anushkasinghh @yguclu \nThanks for bringing this up, this code snipped is ridiculously complicated and doesn't do what it's supposed to do :')\n\nThe explicit matrix inverse was never truly needed, and yet there's no time to gain as the entire test ran in < 3 seconds on my machine.\n\nThis particular part of the test was designed to test whether power operations (**0, **1, **2) work with inverse linear operators (ILOs).\n\nThe poorly executed idea of the test was the following:\n```python\n# arbitrary tolerance\ntol = \n\n# Define 2-norm of vector using inner (as proposed by Yaman)\nnorm2 = lambda v: sqrt(v.inner(v))\n\n# Psydac objects, solver with tolerance = tol\nu\nB_ILO = inverse(B, 'cg', tol=tol)\n\n# First test: Check whether B_ILO**0 is the identity matrix (B_ILO**0 = id?)\n\nerror = (B_ILO**0) @ u - u\nassert norm2(error) < 1e-15 # error should really be zero\n\n# Second test: Check whether B_ILO**1 really computes the inverse up to accuracy (B_ILO**1 = B_ILO?)\n# I.e., we expect B @ B_ILO**1 @ u to be equal to u + err, err a vector of norm less than tol\n\nerror = B @ B_ILO**1 @ u - u\nassert norm2(error) < tol\n\n# Third test: Now checking whether B_ILO**2 is really equal to a double application of B_ILO (B_ILO**2 = B_ILO @ B_ILO?)\n# B @ B @ B_ILO @ B_ILO @ u = B @ ( B_ILO @ u + err1 ) = u + err2 + B @ err1\n# where both err1 and err2 are vectors of norm less than tol, hence\n# | B @ B @ B_ILO @ B_ILO @ u - u | = | err2 + B @ err1 | < | err2 | + | B @ err1 | < tol + |B|_{inf} * tol = (1 + |B|_{inf}) * tol\n\nadjusted_tol = ( 1 + np.max(np.abs(B.toarray())) ) * tol\nerror = B @ B @ B_ILO**2 @ u - u\nassert norm2(error) < adjusted_tol", "So if I understand correctly, the old error estimate was:\n```\nerror_est = 2 + n1 * n2 * np.max([np.abs(b_inv_arr[i]) for i in range(len(b_inv_arr))])\nassert norm2((B @ bi22) - bi12) < error_est * tol\n```\n\n@jowezarek 's suggestion improves this by incorporating a more accurate error bound:\n```\nerror_est = (1 + norm(B)) * tol # or error_est = (1 + np.max(np.abs(B.toarray())) ) * tol\nerror = B @ B @ B_ILO**2 @ u - u\nassert norm2(error) < error_est\n\n```\nThis should yield a more reliable tolerance without significant performance cost.\n" ],

      "description" : "### Why do we need this improvement?\n\nCurrently, the website lacks a mechanism for users to easily share blog posts on social media platforms. This limits the reach and visibility of the content, making it harder for readers to promote the blogs organically to a broader audience.\n\n### How will this change help?\n\nThis change will ease the sharing of blog amongst social platforms.\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### How could it be implemented/designed?\n\nAdd social sharing buttons to each blog post. These buttons should allow users to share the post on popular platforms such as:\n\n    Twitter\n    LinkedIn\n\nEach button should generate a pre-filled sharing link, including the blog post title, URL, and possibly hashtags. For example:\n\n```Twitter: https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Check+out+this+blog!&url=https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/2024-annual-summary#social-media```\n\nThe buttons should be visually appealing, lightweight, and non-intrusive. They can be displayed at the top or bottom of each blog post.\n\n### \uD83D\uDEA7 Breaking changes\n\nYes\n\n### \uD83D\uDC40 Have you checked for similar open issues?\n\n- [x] I checked and didn't find a similar issue\n\n### \uD83C\uDFE2 Have you read the Contributing Guidelines?\n\n- [x] I have read the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/asyncapi/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n### Are you willing to work on this issue?\n\nYes I am willing to submit a PR!",

      "description" : "### Description\n\nAmazon Systems Manager (SSM) is used by system admins to manage AWS resources like EC2. It also provided ability for companies to run scripts on the EC2 machines securely using it's RunCommand feature. Adding SSM RunCommand Operator to the Amazon provider package will unlock migration to Airflow from legacy job scheduling frameworks like AutoSys\n\n### Use case/motivation\n\nI work with a few customers that are in the process of migrating jobs from AutoSys and other legacy frameworks to Airflow. For these customers, a lot of their existing jobs are in shell scripts running on EC2. When they migrate to Airflow, they are looking for an easy way to lift those scripts and run on Airflow. SSHOperator could be an option for this but in many corporate environments, SSH is disabled for security reasons. One of the secure ways AWS recommends executing a remote script on EC2 is by using SSM RunCommand.\n\n### Related issues\n\n_No response_\n\n### Are you willing to submit a PR?\n\n- [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n",
