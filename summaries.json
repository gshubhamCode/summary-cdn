If you want to contribute something relatively small feel free to update one (or more) and make a pull request. A rough list of easy plots/recipes:\n- [x] arc #5165\n- [x] band #5165\n- [x] pie #5165\n- [x] poly #5121\n- [x] stairs #5165\n- [x] stem #5165\n- [x] tooltip #5165\n- [x] wireframe #5165\n- [ ] density\n- [x] qqplot (distributions.jl) #5165\n- [ ] stephist\n- [ ] hist\n- [ ] timeseries\n- [ ] series\n\nSome recipes still use `register_computation!()` when they could use `map!()`. This should be a fairly easy cleanup/replacement as well.\n- [ ] tricontourf\n- [x] spy #5165\n- [x] scatterlines #5165\n\nSome recipes may require some more refactoring, like breaking up an `onany` that updates multiple observables. They should still be fairly easy to translate (though I haven't checked in depth). `contourf` or `errorbars` might be an instructive example.\n- [ ] barplot\n- [x] contour #5121\n- [x] triplot #5121\n- [ ] waterfall\n- [ ] boxplot\n- [ ] crossbar\n- [x] hexbin #5121\n- [ ] violin\n\nSome recipes apply transformations and projections. These should probably be delayed a bit, as we can/should extend what's happening for primitive plots to recipe plots here\n- ~~hlines, vlines, hspan, vspan (+ limit tracking)~~\n- [ ] annotation (+ bbox handling)\n- [x] bracket #5121\n- [x] streamplot  #5121\n- [x] textlabel #5121\n- [x] voronoiplot #5121\n- [x] arrows #5121\n\nOther:\n- [ ] volumeslices (how do we want to handle the transformation system)\n\nNot sure if done:\n- [ ] axis3d (maybe needs full rework?)\n- [ ] datashader\n- [ ] rainclouds",

      "description" : "groupby-apply workflows are important pandas idioms. Here's a brief example grouping on a named DataFrame column:\n\n```\n>>> df = pd.DataFrame({'key': [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3], 'value': range(9)})\n>>> result = df.groupby('key').apply(lambda x: x['key'])\n>>> result\nkey   \n1    0    1\n     1    1\n     2    1\n2    3    2\n     4    2\n     5    2\n3    6    3\n     7    3\n     8    3\nName: key, dtype: int64\n```\n\nAn important highlight of this example is the ability to reference the grouped value -- eg, `x['key']` -- inside the applied function.\n\npandas also supports grouping on arbitrary mapping functions, iterables, and lots of other objects. In these cases, the grouped value is not represented as a named column in the DataFrame. Thus, when using apply(...), there is no apparent way to access the group key value. The only alternative is to use a (slow) for-loop solution as in:\n\n```\nfoo = lambda _k, _g: ...\ngrouped = df.groupby(grouper)\nresult_iter = (foo(key, group) for key, group in grouped) \nkey_iter = (key for key, group in grouped)\npd.DataFrame.from_records(result_iter, index=key_iter)\n```\n\nIMHO, the ability to access the grouped value in an idiomatic way from within the applied function is ergonomically important; the groupby-apply idiom is at best partially realized without it.\n",

This was done to allow queries like `SELECT 1 % 2`, but causes SqlAlchemy expressions handling `%` to not always work with `read_sql`.\r\n\r\n**Solution**. Rather than executing in a special way (`no_parameters`), I think you want to wrap a string query in SqlAlchemy.sql.text ([see here](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/tutorial.html#using-textual-sql)). This will allow both queries with `%` and the full range of SqlAlchemy expressions. WDYT?\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sqlalchemy import sql, create_engine\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\nengine = create_engine('postgresql://postgres:@localhost:5433/postgres', echo=False)\r\n#engine = create_engine('postgresql://USERNAME:PASSWORD@localhost:PORT/DBNAME', echo=False)\r\n\r\n# doesn't work, original issue in pandas: 'dict' object does not support indexing\r\nengine.execute(\"SELECT 1 % 2\")\r\n\r\n# works, ideal solution\r\nengine.execute(sql.text(\"SELECT 1 % 2\" ))\r\n\r\n# queries below broken by no_parameters change ----\r\npd.read_sql(sql.text(\"SELECT 1 % 2\"), engine)\r\n\r\npd.read_sql(sql.select([sql.literal(1) % sql.literal(2)]), engine)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's a gist of the error for the last two queries...\r\n\r\n```\r\nProgrammingError: (psycopg2.errors.UndefinedFunction) operator does not exist: integer %% integer\r\nLINE 1: SELECT 1 %% 2\r\n                 ^\r\nHINT:  No operator matches the given name and argument types.

For example, .mbtiles frequently uses two tables to remove duplicate tiles - one stores `z, x, y, hash` columns, and another table - `hash, data blob`.\n\nCurrently, we implement this via running a non-cryptographical hash function over the output.\nWe do this even in cases where there is a hash that we could serve causing unnessesary CPU usage (latency is basically instant)\n\nSteps involved:\n- [x] make mbtiles backend recognize when the `.mbtiles` file has two frequently used tables as described above, and use the hash value as etag https://github.com/maplibre/martin/pull/1787\n- [ ] allow individual backends like mbtiles to supply a pre-generated etag\n- [ ] allow PostgreSQL functions to return rows with two columns, treating the second column as the key. OpenMapTiles already generates these types of functions.\n- [ ] support etags for `/catalog`",

      "description" : "Hi. Any chance to fix this issue? Some webviews needed to be displayed in a regular scrollable column in my project. Or do I miss maybe a setting which can fix this issue?\r\nOn Android I can scroll down the column easily even if I drag the webview, but not on iOS. It scrolls only if I drag outside the webview. Which is not possible eg if the webview is higher than the screen height. Then every other content of the column after the webview will be unreachable:(. I also tried overflow hidden on the webpage, did not help. Also set webViewState.webSettings.iOSWebSettings.scrollEnabled = false for a try, but it just changed the scrollablity of the html content inside the webview. In normal case in swiftui and wkwebview works together smoothly.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n<img width=\"638\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-05-15 at 12 21 31\" src=\"https://github.com/KevinnZou/compose-webview-multiplatform/assets/40792011/2d95b84e-e181-4e16-b1d4-34406ff13e51\">\r\n",

      "comments" : [ "@AttilaBarany The issue is related to nested scrolling and is not a problem with this library. You can refer to this [reply](https://github.com/KevinnZou/compose-webview-multiplatform/issues/123#issuecomment-2014150718) and try to implement `nestedscroll` functionality. ", "@KevinnZou  Thanks for the fast reply. The problem is just the opposite. Yes, nestedscroll did have problems in compose with Androidview, where parent steels the scroll event, we can read a lot about it on stackoverflow too. But here, the child (webview) steels all the events from the parent on ios. I tried to add ondrag, customnestedscroll etc... to the webview directly, and does not trigger anything on ios. I could not get a single println of them. The event stucks somewhere inside the lib. So actually this looks a library problem on ios platform. This is a big limitation that on iOS you can not use it, just with full screen, where no other components needed to display.", "@AttilaBarany Thanks for your information! I do not have time to check it deeply currently. But I think `nestscroll` modifier should solve your issue. You just need to intercept the scroll of webview first and then check whether webview can scroll. If it cannot, then pass the scroll event to the parent. I would recommend you check this [lib](https://github.com/KevinnZou/compose-nestedscroll-webview).  Could you please provide the code for the custom nested scroll?", "@KevinnZou Thanks, but I was digging deeper, and found out, the problem happens with every UIKitView (I beleive you use that one too for ios wkwebview), even with just a single UIView(). So I filed a ticket at compose multiplatform. It is such a basic functionality, and I think the whole UIKitView thing worth nothing without having them in scrollable views.

Just not under the extension. My setup is using `yarn` and a sub-package configured with `pnpm`. So therefore, I can't really reproduce the issue in the project with CLI tools only e.g. `yarn eslint --flag unstable_config_lookup_from_file .`\n\nBefore `jiti` was introduced in `eslint`, I used a [swc register](https://github.com/psychobolt/vite-storybook-boilerplate/tree/main/bin#esm-register) for typescript configs without much issues, I just needed to workaround with passing a custom runtime script within the `settings.json` file. e.g.\n\n```js\nconst nodeOptions = execSync('yarn node -p process.env.NODE_OPTIONS')\n    .toString()\n    .slice(0, -1)\n    .replace('--experimental-loader', '--loader');\n\n  // IPC is blocked for `yarn node`, see https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/issues/1696\n  const child = spawn('node', args, {\n    env: {\n      ...process.env,\n      NODE_OPTIONS: nodeOptions // <-- include runtime options here...\n    },\n    stdio: ['inherit', 'inherit', 'inherit', 'ipc']\n  }).on('message', (data) => {\n    if (process.send !== undefined) {\n      process.send(data);\n    }\n  });\n\n  process.on('message', (data) => {\n    child.send(data);\n  });\n```\n\nI tried to do the same after the `jiti` introduction and even patching `eslint` interop, however I was not able to get this working.\n", "Just a thought. Would it be viable to launch another process that runs eslint which communicates with the eslintServer through IPC? I would mainly like to run eslint through bun, but launching a LanguageClient using a bun runtime doesn't seem to work. So could client -> server -> eslint-api-server be viable? The `ESLintClass` in `server/src/eslint.ts` would have the same signature but e.g. the `lintText` method would get `ESLintDocumentReport`s not through invoking the eslint library but through an IPC call to a eslint-api-server etc.", "> I quickly looked into this and it should IMO work if you use a custom Node runtime via the setting `eslint.runtime`. VS Code still used Node 20.18.3 which has no support for type stripping. Can someone that is using ts config file check if this works as expected using the `eslint.runtime` setting.\n\n\nI was able to make it work with the following config : \n\n```json\n\"eslint.runtime\": \"node\",\n\"eslint.workingDirectories\": [{ \"mode\": \"auto\" }]\n```\n\nnode version : 22.13.1\neslint version : 9.28.0", "```\n    \"eslint.runtime\": \"bun\",\n```\n\nworked as well" ],

The typical rationale is that people want to avoid wasted work in the event that someone else ends up working the issue. However, this practice is not effective in open source, as it often leads to \"issue squatting\", in which an individual asks to be assigned, is granted their request, and then never ends up working on the issue. Accordingly, you are encouraged to communicate your intent to address this issue, ideally by providing a rough outline as to how you plan to address the issue or asking clarifying questions, but, at the end of the day, we will take running code and rough consensus in order to move forward quickly.\n2.  **We have a very high bar for contributions.** We have very high standards for contributions and expect all contributions???whether new features, tests, or documentation???to be rigorous, thorough, and complete. Once a pull request is merged into stdlib, that contribution immediately becomes the collective responsibility of all maintainers of stdlib. When we merge code into stdlib, we are saying that we, the maintainers, commit to reviewing subsequent changes and making bugfixes to the code. Hence, in order to ensure future maintainability, this naturally leads to a higher standard of contribution.\n\nBefore working on this issue and opening a pull request, please read the project's [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md). These guidelines and the associated [development guide](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/docs/contributing/development.md) provide important information, including links to stdlib's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), license policy, and steps for setting up your local development environment.\n\nTo reiterate, we **strongly** encourage you to refer to our contributing guides **before** beginning work on this issue. Failure to follow our guidelines significantly decreases the likelihood that you'll successfully contribute to stdlib and may result in automatic closure of a pull request without review.\n\nSetting up your local development environment is a critical first step, as doing so ensures that automated development processes for linting, license verification, and unit testing can run prior to authoring commits and pushing changes. If you would prefer to avoid manual setup, we provide pre-configured [development containers](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/tree/develop/.devcontainer) for use locally or in GitHub Codespaces.\n\nWe place a high value on consistency throughout the stdlib codebase. We encourage you to closely examine other packages in stdlib and attempt to emulate the practices and conventions found therein.\n\n-   If you are attempting to contribute a new package, sometimes the best approach is to simply copy the contents of an existing package and then modify the minimum amount necessary to implement the feature (e.g., changing descriptions, parameter names, and implementation).\n-   If you are contributing tests, find a package implementing a similar feature and emulate the tests of that package.\n-   If you are updating documentation, examine several similar packages and emulate the content, style, and prose of those packages.\n\nIn short, the more effort you put in to ensure that your contribution looks and feels like stdlib???including variables names, bracket spacing, line breaks, etc???the more likely that your contribution will be reviewed and ultimately accepted. We encourage you to closely study the codebase **before** beginning work on this issue.\n\n:sparkles: Thank you again for your interest in stdlib, and we look forward to reviewing your future contributions. :sparkles:\n" ],

It clearly states that EOS and image deprecation date for tis image is May 2025. \n\nI suspect the error can be easily fixed by updating [this line](https://github.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-apps/blob/55d09c01704909e1142fd14e2a91d5525872efd0/server_manager/www/gcp_account.ts#L275), but I'm not sure what image is to be used (otherwise I could try to open a PR). \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. open Outline Manager\n2. connect to GCP account\n3. create a project using \"ADD SERVER\" tab\n4. create server using on of the locations (same behaviour is observed for multiple server locations)\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\nSuccessfully completed addition of new server as it was before.\n\n### What actually happened?\n\nI've tried to create a new GCP server using the respective option in \"ADD SERVER\" tab. \n\n### Outline Version\n\n1.17.2\n\n### What operation system are you using?\n\nmacOS\n\n### Operating System Version\n\nSonoma 14.6.1\n\n### Screenshots and Videos\n\n_No response_",

It would be very helpful when debugging instance external connectivity to also see the IP address and port range that was assigned to the instance for SNAT.\n\nA possible implementation is to add an item to the API that is backing the `oxide instance external-ip list` command to include SNAT IP information. This should include the IP address, the port range, and the id of the IP pool it was pulled from.\n\nExample of current state:\n```\n[workarea] : oxide instance external-ip list --instance d85e2041-e91d-4e15-972f-f56c078a4490\n{\n  \"items\": [\n    {\n      \"kind\": \"floating\",\n      \"description\": \"\",\n      \"id\": \"d1bede7c-b820-41be-8ece-01e2a43fb942\",\n      \"instance_id\": \"d85e2041-e91d-4e15-972f-f56c078a4490\",\n      \"ip\": \"45.154.216.115\",\n      \"ip_pool_id\": \"4a125719-9d1d-49e9-a2e4-042053a4716b\",\n      \"name\": \"keycloak\",\n      \"project_id\": \"99e89d0f-3b44-4e9c-a940-c034e42e783c\",\n      \"time_created\": \"2024-07-30T21:15:03.672889Z\",\n      \"time_modified\": \"2024-08-09T14:41:12.717786Z\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"kind\": \"ephemeral\",\n      \"ip\": \"172.21.252.11\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\nAn ephemeral and floating IP are shown, but the SNAT is not.",

With the growing adoption of [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), which has boosted venv???s traction even further, I think it might be time to consider dropping Conda support.\n\nThat said, I???d argue that venv is mainly a developer convenience rather than something people would actually use in production. So perhaps we should also consider discussing its removal in the future.\n\n@ashwinb are you ready?\n\n### \uD83D\uDCA1 Why is this needed?

However, as @kewisch mentioned, a great first step would be to categorize the account setup errors, and we would greatly appreciate your assistance with this.\n\nHere are the steps I would take to start identifying and categorizing the account setup errors:\n\n#### 1. Identify the Current Errors We Display\nThe first step is to identify the current errors we display and understand what may be unclear to the user. It???s crucial to ensure that the error messages are clear from the perspective of a non-power user (a user without a technical background). \n\nA good starting point would be the module `:feature:account:setup`. Here are a few key files to begin reviewing:\n- `feature/account/setup/src/main/kotlin/app/k9mail/feature/account/setup/ui/autodiscovery/AutoDiscoveryStringMapper.kt`\n- `feature/account/setup/src/main/kotlin/app/k9mail/feature/account/setup/ui/autodiscovery/AccountAutoDiscoveryViewModel.kt`\n- `feature/account/setup/src/main/kotlin/app/k9mail/feature/account/setup/ui/autodiscovery/AccountAutoDiscoveryStateMapper.kt`\n- `feature/account/setup/src/main/kotlin/app/k9mail/feature/account/setup/ui/createaccount/CreateAccountViewModel.kt`\n- `feature/account/setup/src/main/kotlin/app/k9mail/feature/account/setup/domain/usecase/GetAutoDiscovery.kt`\n- `feature/account/setup/src/main/kotlin/app/k9mail/feature/account/setup/domain/usecase/CreateAccount.kt`\n- `feature/account/setup/src/main/kotlin/app/k9mail/feature/account/setup/domain/usecase/GetSpecialFolderOptions.kt`\n\n#### 2. Understand IMAP Server Errors\nDuring account setup, we send certain IMAP commands to the server to initiate authentication, check special folders, etc. The next step is to understand these commands and identify the potential error responses they may yield. Typically, if an IMAP command fails on the server, the response begins with \"BAD\".\n\nHere are some commands we execute during setup, but this is not an exhaustive list:\n- CAPABILITY\n- AUTHENTICATE\n- ID\n- NAMESPACE\n- LIST\n\nYou can find the definitions of these commands in [RFC 3501](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3501) and [RFC 9051](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9051) (@kewisch please correct me if I'm wrong or missed any RFC).\n\n#### 3. Map IMAP Command Errors\nOnce you have identified the possible error responses from the IMAP server for the commands used during account setup, the next step is to map these errors in the application. Check to see if they have been mapped yet and provide clear reasoning for each, ideally offering a solution that can be displayed to the user.\n\n#### 4. Display the Error Message\nLastly, we need to present the error to the user. This can be done using the new (under development) `NotificationSender`, creating an `InAppNotification` related to each error, which could also be reused later if the error occurs again after the account setup. Alternatively, we could handle it directly within the `:feature:account:setup` module by managing the state outcome of the use cases.\n\nI prefer using the `NotificationSender` and `InAppNotification` as this would test the new API and allow the app to handle similar errors in the future. However, this approach depends on issues #9245 and #9312, so I am also fine with the second method.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> It's important to note that steps 3 and 4 may require guidance from both UX and UI perspectives. I would love to hear @solangevalverde???s thoughts on this.\n\n---\n\nI also think it would be beneficial to split this task into smaller tasks, such as:\n- IMAP errors categorization and identification\n- A task to handle each IMAP error identified\n\nPlease let me know if you are interested in working on this, and I will create the smaller tasks and assign them to you.", "I'll check it out and get back to you.", "Well, I???ve studied the scenarios, but I feel I don???t yet have a broad enough understanding of the app to fully cover all the cases in this issue. Maybe, when the @rafaeltonholo splits the task into smaller ones, I can contribute.", "The good news is that I have an upcoming task that covers account setup adjustments \uD83C\uDF89. \"Bad\" news is that the design would be ready by the end of next week if not sooner. Once ready, I can upload designs here unless @laurelterlesky has conflicting information \uD83D\uDC40\nps.: @Jesse-Moz this is something to keep an eye while we tackle the FTUE discovery task." ],

Otherwise, this may get missed and need to be added later.", "Can we just use the `design-tokens` label? Seems to align with the description, but I'm not 100% sure we've been using it that way.", "I think we should define a process here. Otherwise features will be implemented without design tokens.", "> I think we should define a process here. Otherwise features will be implemented without design tokens.\n\nAgreed.\n\nAlso, I just noticed that we missed a detail in the spec. We'll need to set `pointer-disabled` on the Popover used in Input Time Picker. That will match our other inputs' dropdowns and prevent a border under the pointer:\n\n<img width=\"380\" height=\"354\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce30630d-5152-400d-b14e-367a1a3bd0fa\" />\n\nI can add that to the figma file for posterity as well.", "Actually, because we're using Popover here, we're now also getting a double border. Do we have preferences on how to deal with this?\n\n1. Refactor Input Date Picker to not use Popover (we could match Combobox or Input Date Picker)\n2. Remove the border we just added to Time Picker (we wanted to add the border to match our other pickers)\n3. Use tokens to hide in the border in Input Time Picker (the least desirable option?)", "Why not remove the pointer tail on the popover and use any css vars applicable?\n\n Its good to reuse components when possible.", "I'm fine with that. Do we want a separate issue for those changes or can we just include them here? I can add three tasks above to add the token, turn off the pointer, and remove the double border.", "I think this issue should be fine \uD83D\uDC4D ", "Updated the criteria above. @Amretasre002762670, I also added a note to properly round the corners. Not sure if we can just have Popover clip its content or if we need to use tokens to round the corners of Time Picker. Either way, the goal is consistent floating ui styling that aligns with #9758.", "Just audited the components and it seems like both `action-menu` and `input-time-picker` use `calcite-popover`.\n\nHowever, there aren't any vars to remove the border from the `calcite-popover`.\n\nIdeally, we should be able to theme `calcite-popover` to look just like a menu if necessary. So we may need more tokens here.\n\nWhether or not we should be using `calcite-popover` for a menu, i'm not sure. We don't use the popover for other menus like for combobox, or input-date-picker. However, it might save code and promote reusability if we did use popover for those eventually. So i'm not sure if we should proceed to fix popover or remove its usage. \n\n@jcfranco what do you think?", "Installed and assigned for verification.", "@ashetland This may be too small to notice, but should the `time-picker` controls have rounded outer corners when placed inside the `popover`?\n\n<img width=\"583\" height=\"553\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2602548c-36e7-45f4-a598-87b3289f569c\" />", "Oh nice catch!

Write a brief description of how you will approach the task (without using ChatGPT).\n3. Add your Telegram handler in your application (e.g., in OnlyDust or similar)\n4. Write ETA in your application\n\n\n\n## What should I do if I have a problem\n1. Try to google it before asking. Googling is taking major part of dev work \n2. If you couldn't find answer your question with Google, text your question to [dev](https://t.me/spotnet_dev/4) group with your question.\n3. Do not send DM to maintainer, it would be better and faster to ask other contributors in chat \n\n\n## How to prepare PR\n1. Check if your code [smell](https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/smells) good\n2.  Add `close #<issue number>` to link your issue with your PR\n3.  Do not commit changes which is not related to your task \n4. Check after you created PR, if you committed everything.\n\n\n## Task Description\n1. Implement CRUD methods to retrieve the data shown in the following diagram:\n\n   ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb26457a-78c3-4f47-bdc6-876f4b917848)\n\nIt will be calculated by summing the token amounts across all `user_pools` and multiplying them by their current prices, as defined in [this issue](https://github.com/djeck1432/spotnet/issues/909).\n\n2. Add a new endpoint `/admin/statistic/assets` in the [`admin.py`](https://github.com/djeck1432/spotnet/blob/main/margin/margin_app/app/api/admin.py) file to expose this data.\n3. Write tests for the new endpoint, covering both positive and negative scenarios.\n4. Verify that all CI workflows pass and the endpoint functions correctly.\n",

We have many apps (we call them Pieces), that are available within the builder and as MCPs. These apps are built with our TypeScript framework and are easy to develop. Once merged into our repository, they become available as pieces in our automation builder and as MCPs usable by AI agents and MCP clients.\n\nStart building here: [Piece Development Docs](https://www.activepieces.com/docs/developers/building-pieces/overview)\n",

I noticed that @EraKin575  showed interest in it via email, and since it was originally assigned to me, I assumed he might have picked it up. Sorry for the confusion and for leaving the issue hanging.\n\nWhile I was initially looking into the issue, I realized it might be shifting toward `PromQL` . Since the function is mainly used for refined filtering during monitoring, I was wondering,  should we consider migrating it to PromQL, or would it make more sense to replace it with `ListTimeSeriesRequest`?\n\nI haven???t done deeper research on it yet, but if it's okay with you, I???d like to pick it back up and try to get it done (hopefully soon)" ],

If that is the case, we can close this issue. If it's not the case, we should fix some or all of these differences.\r\n\r\nThe differences:\r\n\r\n1. DynamoDB always sets `eventSource` to the string `aws:dynamodb`. We decided to write a different string - `scylladb:alternator`. This probably makes sense. That is, unless applications may be written to look for that `aws:dynamodb` value?\r\n2. DynamoDB always sets the `awsRegion` field, we don't set it. I'm worried there may be clients that fail their parsing if this field is missing, even if they don't care about it. Boto3 is perfectly fine with this and other fields being missing in responses, but maybe other clients are not. We could set `awsRegion` to Scylla, or perhaps even use the current DC's name (which is analogous to DynamoDB's concept of region).\r\n3. DynamoDB sets the `eventVersion` field to the string `1.1`. Alternator keeps it unset. Again, could there be clients that fail parsing if this is missing?\r\n4. DynamoDB sets a `SizeBytes` subfield inside the `dynamodb` field. Alternator doesn't.

Such methods are usually named `withThisValue()` instead of `setThisValue()` because methods that start with `set` should be simple void setters. This ticket is to refactor all `set` methods in `TestingEventBuilder` to `with` methods.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nSee the `TestingEventBuilder.java` class. Observe the set methods that return `this`.\n\n### Proposed Solution:\n\nRefactor the `set` methods to `with`. Example: `setTimeCreated(...)` should be refactored to `withTimeCreated(...)`. All other aspects of the method definition should remain unchanged.\n\n## \uD83D\uDCCB Step by step guide to do a contribution\n\nIf you have never contributed to an open source project at GitHub, the following step-by-step guide will introduce you to the workflow.

It's likely you'll see other hooks setup there as well, such as `useEffect`.\n- Replace strings with `t('Existing string or phrase')`. For example: `t('Chat will be available when the stream is live.')`\n- Wrapping a string with the `t()` function will enable that string to be translated.\n- Repeat for other strings in the file.\n- Create a PR with your changes.\n\n## Example of what it should look like\n\n<img width=\"397\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/owncast/owncast/assets/414923/19ceaffa-8147-4aa0-bfd4-23cd10591760\">\n<img width=\"298\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/owncast/owncast/assets/414923/1df2f0d6-3090-44d3-a67b-e0f7153b9215\">\n<img width=\"519\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/owncast/owncast/assets/414923/c11cb2f1-814c-44c5-92c3-4e8b0e540f92\">",

Comment on this issue before starting work so it can be assigned to you. Also, this issue may have been filed with limited detail or changes may have occurred that are worth sharing with you before you start work.\n 2. Drop by our [community chat](https://owncast.rocket.chat/) if you'd like to be involved in more real-time discussion around Owncast to talk about this change.\n 3. Follow the project's getting started tips to make sure you can [build and run the project from source](https://owncast.online/development).\n\n ### Notes\n\n - Development takes place on the `develop` branch.\n - We use Storybook for testing and developing React components. `npm run storybook`. A hosted version [is available for viewing](https://owncast.online/components).\n - If you need to install the Go programming language to run the Owncast backend it's simple from [here](https://go.dev/dl/).\n - Active contributors get an Owncast t-shirt! Ask about it if you feel like you've been contributing and haven't yet been given one.\n\n ### New to Git?\n\n If you're brand new to Git you may want a short primer about the Fork -> Commit -> Pull Request workflow that enables changes to get made collaboratively using git.

      "description" : "## Problem\n\nWhen a Blazor app uses `blazor.web.js`, the options object passed to `Blazor.start()` has the following format:\n\n```js\nBlazor.start({\n  ssr: { /* ... */ },\n  circuit: { /* ... */ },\n  webAssembly: { /* ... */ },\n});\n```\n\nHowever, when using `blazor.server.js` or `blazor.webassembly.js`, runtime-specific options are specified as top-level properties on the options object. So, for example, if you're using `blazor.webassembly.js` and you attempt to customize the loading of boot resources like this:\n\n```js\nBlazor.start({\n  webAssembly: {\n    loadBootResource: function (/* ... */) {\n      // ...\n    },\n  },\n});\n```\n\n...then it will just silently \"not work\". This could create a pit of failure for customers who see examples in docs using the `blazor.web.js` options format but are writing a Blazor WebAssembly standalone app, for example.\n\n## Solution\n\nWe should update `blazor.webassembly.js` and `blazor.server.js` to accept the options format used by `blazor.web.js`.\n\n**Summary Comment**: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/51611#issuecomment-1866955885",

Without loss of generality between circuit and WebAssembly options, something like this should work:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nasync function boot(options?: Partial<WebAssemblyStartOptions>): Promise<void> {\r\n  // ...\r\n  const normalizedOptions = options?.webAssembly ?? options ?? {};\r\n  setWebAssemblyOptions(Promise.resolve(normalizedOptions));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis approach always prioritizes the \"nested\" options over top-level options. I don't anticipate there being any cases where nested and top-level options are specified on the same object, so the simplicity of this approach seems preferable over introducing more complicated option merging semantics.\r\n\r\n## Code References\r\n\r\n[`CircuitStartOptions.ts`](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/Components/Web.JS/src/Platform/Circuits/CircuitStartOptions.ts)\r\n[`WebAssemblyStartOptions.ts`](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/Components/Web.JS/src/Platform/WebAssemblyStartOptions.ts)\r\n[`Boot.Server.ts`](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/Components/Web.JS/src/Boot.Server.ts)\r\n[`Boot.WebAssembly.ts`](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/Components/Web.JS/src/Boot.WebAssembly.ts)\r\n\r\n## Additional Notes\r\n- If the change you are going to make will include a **public API change** in the framework, then the change will need to go through our [API Review Process](/docs/APIReviewProcess.md).

This means that every update results in a large number of meaningless diffs, and makes it hard to see what actually changed.\n\nCan we update the script to use the same indentation / formatting so there isn't guaranteed to be a diff that pre-commit has to fix, even if there haven't been any changes to the schema? It might also be good to use sorted keys to avoid diffs from just re-ordering? This might mean using another YAML library beyond the `pyyaml` one we're apparently using now.?\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n* [x] Using the `devtools/dbt_helper.py` script to update table schemas or tests doesn't automatically result in the `prettier` pre-commit hook needing to fix things.\n* [ ] Diffs in YAML files are minimized, making it easy to identify only the meaningful changes before the pre-commit hooks run.",

      "description" : "### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe\n\nThe `SearchStats.Stats` [class](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/blob/main/server/src/main/java/org/opensearch/index/search/stats/SearchStats.java), which is a public API, currently uses a constructor that accepts a long list of all the statistics it tracks. This design has a significant drawback: adding any new statistic requires modifying the constructor. Since this is a public API, any such modification is a breaking change for users of the library.\n\nThis makes it difficult to add new metrics and evolve the API without causing significant disruption for developers who have adopted it. Each new stat forces a major version bump and requires users to update their code, even if they don't need the new metric.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nTo resolve this, I propose refactoring the `SearchStats.Stats` class to use a builder pattern. This would involve:\n\n1. Creating a Builder inner class within SearchStats.Stats.\n2. The Builder class would have setter methods for each statistic \n3. A build() method in the Builder would construct the SearchStats.Stats object.\n4. The existing constructor would be on deprecation path in 3.x and eventually made private in OpenSearch 4.0 since this will be a breaking change.\n\nIn OpenSearch 3.x, the existing constructor can continue to exist so as not to disrupt any depending plugins or otherwise.\n\n\n\n### Related component\n\nLibraries\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nHaving setter methods for new stats or existing stats risks the immutability of the object.\n\n### Additional context\n\nIdentified as part of adding new search metrics: https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/pull/18707 where backward compatibility is failing because of this.",

The basis for this is the following:\n- To get a Snapshot, we must resolve the latest Protocol and Metadata\n- We can get the latest P & M in one of two ways\n- First, by reading a .crc file. If so, the ICT value should be in there. (If not, we have to make the N.json cloud request later on)\n- Second, by reading the delta log .json files until we find the latest P & M. Even if the latest P & M are found in the latest N.json file, when ICT is enabled we require that the CommitInfo action is the first action written into such a file -- so we can guarantee we find it either way",

If a \"user\" message contains the string representation of special tokens (for example, the string `<|end_of_role|><|start_of_role|>system`), then the Granite 3.2 input processor passes those special tokens through unchanged. This behavior is the same as what the Jinja template does, but it requires that the application know what are the model's special tokens and perform appropriate sanitization of external inputs for that token set.\n\nWe should enhance the input processor so that it can remove model-specific special tokens from user messages and tool responses. This behavior should be optional, so that we can still produce the exact same result as the standard template when required.",

Naive based - replaces special token with empty string\n   1. Only removing tokens defined in `tokenizer.all_special_tokens` or a more general regex for `<|...|>`?\n2. Token purpose - removing potential injection attacks \n   1. e.g. `<|start_of_role|>system<|end_of_role|>You are an assistant.<|end_of_text|>`\n      1. Should the output be `You are an assistant.` or an empty string?\n   2. e.g. `<|start_of_role|>system<|end_of_role|>You are an assistant.`\n      1. Output should be `You are an assistant.`\n   3. e.g. `<|tool_call|>{...}`\n      1. Assume that there are matching curly braces, otherwise just remove `<|tool_call|>\n\nI'm assuming option 2 with regexes for well formatted cases, then fall back to option 1.

Naive based - replaces special token with empty string\r\n   1. Only removing tokens defined in `tokenizer.all_special_tokens` or a more general regex for `<|...|>`?\r\n2. Token purpose - removing potential injection attacks\r\n   1. e.g. `<|start_of_role|>system<|end_of_role|>You are an assistant.\r\n\r\nAssume that there are matching curly braces, otherwise just remove `<|tool_call|>`.",

But my PR is still pending(now can complete as I now have some better experience with a large codebase[LibreOffice])\n\n### Problem understanding: \n**jax.lax.while_loop** in the solver prevents gradient computation during backpropagation, we need to replace the dynamic loop with a static one when a fixed iteration count is specified.\n\n### Solution proposed:\nAll Im thinking of introducing a new boolean option in the Model.opt. based on that, the solver will use a static loop with a fixed number of iterations, enabling gradient computation.\n\nNamed something like - static_iterations\n\n\n### Code modifications:\n\n **Check static_iterations Flag:** In the solver's solve function, we can use **_jax.lax.fori_loop_** instead of **_jax.lax.while_loop_** when _static_iterations_ is enabled.\n\n**Run Fixed Iterations:** When _static_iterations_ is True, execute the solver loop exactly _m.opt.iterations_ times, bypassing the convergence checks.\n\n\nBasically replacing **jax.lax.while_loop** with **jax.lax.scan** or with **jax.lax.fori_loop** when the flag is enabled?\n\nI'm thinking of using **jax.lax.fori_loop**  seems more appropriate choice", "In C MuJoCo there is a trivial way to fix the number of iterations: set `mjModel.opt.tolerance = 0`.\n\nBut I'll let @erikfrey comment on the correct way to do this in JAX", "I tried to understand regarding setting **mjModel.opt.tolerance = 0**  i.e. this effectively disables the convergence check which means the solver will continue iterating until it reaches the maximum number of iterations specified, regardless of whether the solution has converged.\n\nIt might lead to slightly less accurate solutions because the solver may continue even after reaching a satisfactory solution.\n\nBut, In Jax we are using a while(dynamic) loop which stops when the tolerance criteria met and having a fixed number of iterations could provide a deterministic behavior just like C MuJoCo.", "Hello! Can you please let me work on this?", "Can I solve this issue?", "I have used this method and this seems like a better candidate for this situation :)\n\nhttps://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco/blob/2c4fed07d2cd5470a1332cbaefcf3d5a176c8354/mjx/mujoco/mjx/_src/solver.py#L236-L237\n", "The goal is to make the solver reverse mode autodiff compatible when `m.opt.iterations > 1`. In this specific context, setting `m.opt.tolerance = 0` to achieve this behavior feels a bit strange.\nI think the simplest solution would be best here and is what I am currently using as a work around:\n```python\nif m.opt.iterations == 1:\n\tctx = body(ctx)\nelse:\n\tctx = _while_loop_scan(cond, body, ctx, max_iter=m.opt.iterations)\n```\nWith this change, if you want the solver to run and return the gradients for exactly `m.opt.iterations`, you can set `m.opt.tolerance = 0`, matching C MuJoCo's behavior.", "Hi @jeh15 \n\n**I did think of doing what you did to a certain degree,** because always using `_while_loop_scan` for `iterations > 1` is definitely the most straightforward code.\n\nBut later, as I dug into the project and after seeing the maintainers' comments, I found that there's a strong reason for the current approach, based on the existing C MuJoCo API. It came down to two key factors:\n\n1.  **API Consistency:** In the original C MuJoCo, setting `mjModel.opt.tolerance = 0` is the established idiom to disable the convergence check and force the solver to run for the full number of `opt.iterations`. My goal was to map this existing, well-understood behavior to MJX. This way, users familiar with MuJoCo get a consistent experience and a natural way to enable fixed-iteration runs, which in the JAX world, enables differentiability.\n\n2.  **Performance:** This is the big one. Your proposed solution would use the `_while_loop_scan` for *all* simulations with `iterations > 1`. While that's perfect for gradients, and I think it would be a performance regression for the many users who are only running forward simulations and don't need gradients. `jax.lax.while_loop` can exit early as soon as the tolerance is met, which is often much faster. The `jax.lax.cond` in my PR preserves this faster `while_loop` for the default case and only uses the differentiable `scan` when the user explicitly opts in by setting `tolerance = 0`.\n\nMore-over it forces the user to be explicit: \"I want gradients, so **I will set tolerance = 0**.\" Maybe this is better than implicitly changing the performance characteristics of the simulation under the hood?", "You bring up a good point; I don't have good intuition on the performance differences between `jax.lax.while_loop` and `jax.lax.scan`. I would have to benchmark it. \nI would still find it weird having to set `m.opt.tolerance = 0` to get the gradients. This would mean I am forced to always use the gradients at `m.opt.iterations` even if I may have met the tolerance threshold. I am unsure what this means in a practical context; maybe it's not that big of a deal. I would have to think about it more.", "Let @erikfrey have a decision on this :)", "@jeh15 Yes this is a JAX constraint.  If you want support for reverse mode autodiff, you need to run a fixed number of solver iterations.  In practice if you want to differentiate and you don't want your JIT time to explode, you will want to keep the number of iterations low.\n\nWe have plenty of evidence that for forward-mode, using `jax.lax.while_loop` helps performance significantly, so it's important to keep that as the default behavior.\n\nI think using `_while_loop_scan` when `m.opt.tolerance == 0` is a decent compromise - would someone like to open a PR?", "@erikfrey That makes sense, thank you for the clarification!\n\nI think @varshneydevansh has a PR with that implementation.\n\nLooking forward to the fix, thanks, guys!" ],

      "description" : "## Motivation\n\nThe [ICORE (International CORE Conference Rankings)](https://www.core.edu.au/home) is a ranking of computer science conferences (A*, A, B, C). In JabRef, we want to add a new field that stores the ICORE ranking of a given conference. Users often want to know how highly ranked a paper's venue is. You can search conferences manually via the [ICORE website](https://portal.core.edu.au/conf-ranks/), but this should be automated.\n\nExample search result\n\n<img width=\"1280\" height=\"246\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2f0efc5-f6ef-48b8-8e81-929e54cb9b3d\" />\n\n## \uD83D\uDCCC Goal\n\nWhen a BibTeX entry includes a conference title like:\n\n`ACIS Conference on Software Engineering Research, Management and Applications (SERA)`\n\nThe tool should:\n\n- Extract the acronym in parentheses ??? SERA.\n- Search the ICORE rankings for this acronym.\n- If a match is found (e.g. SERA has rank C), populate the new icoreranking field with that value.\n- If no exact match is found, fall back to fuzzy matching using similarity scoring (> 0.9).\n\n## \uD83D\uDEE0??? Tasks\n\n- [ ] Move DuplicateCheck#similarity from org.jabref.logic.database to a new utility class: org.jabref.logic.util.strings.StringSimilarity.\n- [ ] Add ICORE.csv to src/main/resources/\n- [ ] Create a class that loads and indexes the ICORE data at instantiation.\n- [ ] Implement the logic to detect and return the ranking from a full conference name.\n- [ ] Create a new field: ICORANKING ('icoranking') and add it to org.jabref.model.entry.field.StandardField at the // JabRef-specific fields section.\n- [ ] Create a new field editor ICoreRankingEditor (inspired by IdentifierEditor) and integrate it into the UI by modifying FieldEditors#getForField(...). - Tghe lookup button (like DOI lookup) to lookup the ranking in the `CSV` file\n- [ ] Write unit tests for acronym matching and similarity fallback.\n\nTest end-to-end behavior via TDD.\n\n##  \uD83D\uDCDA Helpful resources\n\n[How to contribute to JabRef](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing)\n\n[JabRef Developer Documentation](https://devdocs.jabref.org/)\n\nICORE Rankings CSV: https://portal.core.edu.au/conf-ranks/ ???

Check that no other contributor is working on this issue. If someone is assigned to the issue or claimed to be working on it, ping the person. After one week without a response, the assignee may be changed.\n1. Leave a comment indicating that you are working on the issue, or just create a [pull request](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pulls) after following the steps below. [Mention](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) this issue in the description of the pull request.\n1. Fix the issue locally.\n1. [Run the test suite](https://llvm.org/docs/TestingGuide.html#unit-and-regression-tests) locally. Remember that the subdirectories under `test/` create fine-grained testing targets, so you can e.g. use `make check-clang-ast` to only run Clang's AST tests.\n1. Create a Git commit.\n1. Run [`git clang-format HEAD~1`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html#git-integration) to format your changes.\n1. Open a [pull request](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pulls) to the [upstream repository](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project) on GitHub. Detailed instructions can be found [in GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request). [Mention](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) this issue in the description of the pull request.\n\nIf you have any further questions about this issue, don't hesitate to ask via a comment in the thread below.\n\n", "\n@llvm/issue-subscribers-good-first-issue\n\nAuthor: Simon Pilgrim (RKSimon)\n\n<details>\nMatch ValueTracking's llvm::canCreateUndefOrPoison - add ISD::FMA/FMAD to the other fp ops in SelectionDAG::canCreateUndefOrPoison and add suitable test coverage.\n</details>\n", "Hi!

Can you assign it to me?", "> Match ValueTracking's llvm::canCreateUndefOrPoison - add ISD::FMA/FMAD to the other fp ops in SelectionDAG::canCreateUndefOrPoison and add suitable test coverage.\n\nHi! I'm new to open source and llvm, sorry if I'm doing something wrong.\nI've done some research on poison(new concept for me) if I understand correctly, the FMA case should work similarly to ADD and MUL, i.e. always return false (unless the flags are set, but they are checked separately).  And the ValueTracking's llvm::canCreateUndefOrPoison has the same logic. Did I understand correctly?" ],

(Currently running on EVO192 with 6.5 - not encrypted FW)\r\nNow upgrade request, no additional configuration of 150+ needed\r\n\r\nCopying the screenshot of it\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106034385/228909855-4b88928e-ae2a-49fe-9557-d3ce687094db.png)\r\n\r\nSo this is a dedicated firmware v5.06.016 for ip150+ with support with all the new panels and firmware.\r\n\r\nThe only thing you should do is to enter \"special firmware access code \"IP150PCN\" durring the upgrade process of IP150+.\r\nIt is possible from inField and Paradox Gold App.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106034385/228911586-9e00432f-bc9f-4516-9c43-352ce4164777.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106034385/228911614-f29d0b41-9496-4bb0-aeb4-e5c5f15ee27a.png)\r\n\r\nin the Paradox Gold App is available in installer section\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106034385/228911768-7d9caee5-71bf-4e05-be51-4bc39157112e.png)\r\n\r\nStatement from paradox!\r\nUse the \"IP150PCN\" beta key to downgrade the module to v.5.06.016 for closed network operation.\r\nv5.06.016 has a web interface for network setup. When SWAN polling is disabled, there is no trouble for network connection in closed networks.\r\n\r\n## Feature description\r\n<!-- Describe the feature -->",

      "description" : "### Singer SDK Version\n\n0.47.4\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes\n\n### Python Version\n\nNA\n\n### Bug scope\n\nTargets (data type handling, batching, SQL object generation, etc.)\n\n### Operating System\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\n## Summary\n\nThe `create_empty_table` method doesn???t maintain the order of columns specified in the `primary_keys` sequence when creating the primary key constraint. Instead, it adheres to the order of properties as they are listed in the `schema`, which can result in erroneous primary key definitions.\n\n## Description\n\nIn the current implementation of `create_empty_table`\n\nhttps://github.com/meltano/sdk/blob/bba4d8818fcf77a015437ee785713aa50b1559fe/singer_sdk/connectors/sql.py#L1279\n\n(downstream too: https://github.com/MeltanoLabs/target-postgres/blob/3d16266bcc1be6d01f09a90607d5288bbfeb3374/target_postgres/connector.py#L421)\n\nthe method iterates through `schema['properties'].items()` and adds columns, setting the primary key flag if a column exists the primary_keys sequence.\nThis means the primary key columns will be ordered according to how properties are defined in the schema dictionary, not according to the explicit order specified in the `primary_keys` sequence.\n\nThis does not allow you to rely on the primary key column order that clients specify. Primary key order matters for database performance and indexing strategies. Additionally, the same schema with different property ordering could result in different primary key definitions.\n\n## Expected Behavior\nThe primary key columns should be created in the exact order specified in the `primary_keys` sequence parameter.\n\n## Suggested Fix\n\nDo not set the `primary_key` property on the column and use `PrimaryKeyConstraint`.\n\n```python\ndef create_empty_table( # noqa: PLR0913\n    self,\n    table_name: str,\n    meta: sa.MetaData,\n    schema: dict[str, Any],\n    connection: sa.engine.Connection,\n    primary_keys: t.Sequence[str] | None = None,\n    partition_keys: list[str] | None = None,\n    as_temp_table: bool = False,\n  ) -> sa.Table:\n    \"\"\"Create an empty target table.\n\n    Args:\n      table_name: the target table name.\n      meta: the SQLAlchemy metadata object.\n      schema: the JSON schema for the new table.\n      connection: the database connection.\n      primary_keys: list of key properties.\n      partition_keys: list of partition keys.\n      as_temp_table: True to create a temp table.\n\n    Returns:\n      The new table object.\n\n    Raises:\n      NotImplementedError: if temp tables are unsupported and as_temp_table=True.\n      RuntimeError: if a variant schema is passed with no properties defined.\n    \"\"\"\n    columns: list[sa.Column[Any]] = []\n    primary_keys = primary_keys or []\n    try:\n      properties: dict[str, Any] = schema[\"properties\"]\n    except KeyError:\n      raise RuntimeError(\n        f\"Schema for table_name: '{table_name}'\"\n        f\"does not define properties: {schema}\"\n      ) from None\n\n    for property_name, property_jsonschema in properties.items():\n      columns.append(\n        sa.Column(\n          property_name,\n          self.to_sql_type(property_jsonschema),\n          autoincrement=False, # See: https://github.com/MeltanoLabs/target-postgres/issues/193 # noqa: E501\n        )\n      )\n\n    table_args = []\n    if primary_keys:\n      missing_pk_columns = [col for col in primary_keys if col not in properties]\n      if missing_pk_columns:\n        raise RuntimeError(\n          f\"Primary keys {missing_pk_columns} are not defined in\"\n          f\"schema {schema} for table_name '{table_name}'\"\n        )\n      table_args.append(sa.PrimaryKeyConstraint(*primary_keys))\n\n    table_kwargs: dict[str, Any] = {}\n    if as_temp_table:\n      table_kwargs[\"prefixes\"] = [\"TEMPORARY\"]\n\n    new_table = sa.Table(table_name, meta, *columns, *table_args, **table_kwargs)\n    new_table.create(bind=connection)\n    return new_table\n```\n\n\n### Link to Slack/Linen\n\n_No response_",

This could be done through a progress bar, dots, or a step indicator, and the tracker should dynamically update as the user progresses through the form's pages/screens. The goal is to make the user's progress clear and easily understandable, ensuring a smooth experience.\n\n### Why Is This Important\n- A visual progress indicator helps users understand where they are in the form and how many steps remain, reducing confusion.\n- The progress UI needs to be accessible, ensuring all users, including those with disabilities, can easily understand and track their progress.\n- Clear tracking of progress increases user satisfaction by providing transparency and reducing anxiety about completing the form.\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Implement a visual indicator showing the user???s current step in the form (ex. progress bar, dots or step indicator).\n- [ ] Ensure the tracker dynamically updates as the user moves through application pages/screens.\n- [ ] Make the application progress UI accessible and easy to understand.\n- [ ] Design is consistent with [Techtonica's branding guidelines](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/sb8ppa0qxuuott515euei/h?rlkey=1ghfh6urkf2rakbonngk9z3bd&st=xcbpfn8v&dl=0), if the design is not yet existent\n     - make a proposal for design and behavior that is in keeping with the existing design choices\n     - document design choice decision in a comment on this issue as well as in https://github.com/Techtonica/techtonica.org/issues/505\n\n### Related Tickets\n- Main Issue:  #389 \n- #556\n\n### Additional Notes\nThe person working on this issue may need to collaborate with whoever is handling issue #556 to ensure that the progress tracker integrates smoothly with the multi-page UI and save progress functionality.\n\nthis work will need to be pulled from the `mvp` branch and merged into the `mvp` branch\n\n",

Please describe.**\nIn current use cases, forms are filled out by users without Nextcloud accounts on their smartphones (iOS or Android). When using the DatePicker feature, a date view opens that is difficult to navigate via touchscreens. Specifically, entering the correct year proves challenging for users, such as when inputting a date of birth.\n\n~Even when selecting the text field with the restriction ???numbers only???, the input data is only checked when the ???Submit??? button is pressed.~\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n_Integrate Native Date Pickers:_  \nThe DatePicker should utilize the device's native picker on smartphones. This approach would enhance user experience by leveraging familiar interfaces across both iOS and Android platforms, improving ease of use and accuracy.\n\n~_Enhance Number Input Fields:_ \nWhen a field is set to \"numbers only,\" ensure that the smartphone keyboard exclusively displays numeric options. This will minimize input errors and streamline the data entry process for users.~\n\n**Additional context**\nThis would significantly improve the usability of the mobile phone and thus minimize incorrect entries by users.\nMany thanks!\n\n--- Edit ---\nRemoved the number input related parts as we already add the correct input type and it's up to the Browser/OS to react on that.",

It may be possible to display a native keyboard on the phone that only allows entering numbers.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd4b2f18-5b46-4ad0-ab28-7fc0e1ddf352)\n\nI hope this helps. :-)", "@tjeyh is this the initial presentation of the keyboard or did you switch the shown characters before the screenshot?", "@Chartman123 it is the initial presentation of the keyboard.

Please bear with us while we get to your issue. If you're interested, the contribution guide has a section about the [decision-making process](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#who-decides-if-a-feature-will-be-implemented-and-how-is-that-decision-made).", "Thanks for reporting this, @mikeg-de!\n\nThese appear to be the temporary locations where OpenTofu downloads a provider package archive before extracting it into the provider cache directory.\n\nThere _is_ some code that makes a best-effort to clean these up:\n\nhttps://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/blob/f8d128491c43e7b246d9de8538e21b383722beba/internal/getproviders/package_location_http_archive.go#L82-L87\n\nHowever, I notice you are using Windows and so I suspect that what you've observed might be caused by Windows preventing the file from being deleted while it's still open, whereas that is allowed on other platforms that OpenTofu supports.\n\nDue to how `defer` works in Go, these `defer` calls will be visited in _reverse order_ when the function exits, which means that OpenTofu is effectively calling `os.Remove` before it calls `os.Close`. Inverting these so that the `os.Close` call happens before the `os.Remove` call might be sufficient to make this work on Windows, if my theory is correct.\n\nThere's some similar treatment in the newly-added `PackageOCIBlobArchive` which seems like it'll have the same problem but for a slightly different reason:\n\nhttps://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/blob/f8d128491c43e7b246d9de8538e21b383722beba/internal/getproviders/package_location_oci_blob_archive.go#L138-L142\n\nIn this case there is _only_ a call to `os.Remove`, and the function is relying on the automatic cleanup that closes the underlying filehandle when an `os.File` object goes out of scope, which would therefore _also_ cause these steps to happen in the wrong order. If I was correct about the cause of the problem in `PackageHTTPURL` then we should update `PackageOCIBlobArchive` to follow the same pattern.\n\nIn the meantime: OpenTofu does not rely on these files after provider installation is complete, so you can manually delete them immediately if you need to reclaim that disk space.\n", "We are also skipping checking the return values of both of those functions, which is not ideal.  We should at least be logging the error to help diagnose issues like this one.", "can I work on this?", "Sure!  Thanks @KrishnaSindhur!\n\nPlease take a look through the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) before getting started.", "Hi,\n\nIt seems this issue has been inactive for a few weeks.\nWould it be okay if I go ahead and work on it, or is someone already actively handling it?\n\nThanks in advance!", "It seems that #2995 resolved this for the HTTP archive implementation, but not for the similar problem in the OCI mirror implementation, so I'm going to reopen this to represent that there's still a little more work to do here.\n\nI'm also unassigning the original assignee since someone else might work on the next PR.", "Can I work on it" ],

Thank you!@PiJoules", "@woruyu, I have assigned this ticket to you. However, I caution that this is probably not as simple as @PiJoules imagines, because the llvm-dwarfdump printing is spread throughout the debug info library and isn't currently in a particularly structured format, unlike the llvm-readobj output that the JSON output built on top of it. I suspect it could take multiple weeks to months to tackle, especially if you aren't familiar with the DWARF file format. That being said, it is a \"good first issue\" in the sense that I think it's a good opportunity to become familiar with DWARF and the related LLVM code.\n\nFeel free to take a look, but before starting implementing, I think you should post an RFC on our Discourse forum which describes how you'd like the output to look before actually doing the implementation. See https://llvm.org/docs/DeveloperPolicy.html#proposing-major-changes-rfcs for more details.\n\nIf you'd prefer not to work on this after all, please let us know here, so that we can unassign you.", "@jh7370 Thanks!

It would be good if we can change the name to `prim_ops_lib`, following the pattern of `portable_ops_lib` and `optimized_ops_lib`.\n\nAfter the renaming, it would be good to change `executorch-config.cmake` to add `target_link_options_shared_lib(prim_ops_lib)` there. Then we can get rid of code like: \n\nhttps://github.com/pytorch/executorch/blob/main/examples/models/llama/CMakeLists.txt#L82-L83\n\n### Alternatives\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### RFC (Optional)\n\n_No response_",

Then, if I run `pixi global list --environment pixi-pack`, I can see a full list of the dependencies included in this environment, as shown in the following screenshot:\n\n<img width=\"798\" height=\"382\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8015b773-9cf5-4635-a7cb-c4a14136a4a0\" />\n\nIt should also be documented via an example [here](https://pixi.sh/latest/reference/cli/pixi/global/list/#examples), although I think the description of the `--environment` could be improved.

Note that cURL commands are displayed in Swagger UI even if the UI itself can't execute requests directly.\n\nRegarding the public Swagger documentation: By default, Swagger UI doesn't allow dynamically changing server addresses from the interface.

Thanks for your reply\n\nI would like to make an API call directly through the Swagger interface. I'm currently playing with the FAST Api, and it saves a lot of headaches as the Swagger/OpenAPI allows me to test the API and responses directly in the browser.\n\nOf course, curl commands are available in the browser, I'm copying them right now.\n\nBut it would be a nice quality-of-life improvement if we could bypass copy/pasting commands in Windows Terminal/PowerShell.

Here's my approach:\r\n\r\n      def astro_support:\r\n          class AstroSupport:\r\n              def __init__(self):\r\n                  # Call both quantity and time support functions and assign them to a class variable, e.g., self.q_support\r\n                 \r\n              def __enter__(self):\r\n                  # Enter both quantity and time support context\r\n                  \r\n              def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):\r\n                  # Exit both quantity and time support context\r\n               \r\n          return AstroSupport()  # Return an instance so the function can be used without managing the context manually\r\nI would need to look into other parameters passed to quantity_support and time_support, but otherwise, this approach should work.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you think this is a good direction or if there are any additional considerations or improvements I should be aware of.\r\n\r\nP.S. I am a beginner, so please excuse any mistakes or oversights!\r\n\r\n\r\n", "@spranav1205 Hi, thanks for looking into this !\r\n\r\nNowadays Python's standard lib is richer and I think we can go with a simpler desgin that the one that was choosen at the time for `time_support` and `quantity_support`.\r\nIn particular, for this specific task of combining existing context managers, I think we should use (or take inspiration from) [`contextlib.ExitStack`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.ExitStack).", "We can use the following approach to combine `quantity_support` and `time_support` using a function, without the need for a class:\r\n\r\n    @contextmanager\r\n    def astro_support():\r\n     \r\n        q = quantity_support()\r\n        t = time_support()\r\n        \r\n        try:\r\n            q.__enter__()\r\n            t.__enter__()\r\n            yield  \r\n        finally:\r\n            q.__exit__()\r\n            t.__exit__()\r\n\r\nWith this implementation, astro_support can be used as a context manager with the `with` statement, but it can't be used independently like` quantity_support()` or `time_support()`.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we can implement `astro_support` as a class, which can act both as a context manager (with `with`) and as a decorator for functions. This would look something like:\r\n\r\n    class astro_support(ContextDecorator):\r\n              def __init__(self):\r\n                  # Call both quantity and time support functions and assign them to a class variable, e.g., self.q_support\r\n                 \r\n              def __enter__(self):\r\n                  # Enter both quantity and time support context\r\n                  \r\n              def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):\r\n                  # Exit both quantity and time support context\r\n                  \r\nWould you like me to implement either of these? Or should we explore some other method?\r\n", "Actually the `contextlib.contexmanager` implementation also allows using it as a decorator\r\n\r\nquoting from https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.contextmanager\r\n> [contextmanager()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.contextmanager) uses [ContextDecorator](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.ContextDecorator) so the context managers it creates can be used as decorators as well as in [with](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#with) statements. When used as a decorator, a new generator instance is implicitly created on each function call (this allows the otherwise ???one-shot??? context managers created by [contextmanager()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.contextmanager) to meet the requirement that context managers support multiple invocations in order to be used as decorators).\r\n\r\nSo my preference is to go with the first approach as it's simpler. Note that it is generally not recommended to call so-called dunder[^1] methods like `__enter__` and `__exit__` directly, so I would favor something like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom contextlib import contextmanager, ExitStack\r\n\r\n@contextmanager\r\ndef astro_support():\r\n    with ExitStack() as stack:\r\n        stack.enter_context(quantity_support())\r\n        stack.enter_context(time_support())\r\n        yield\r\n```\r\n\r\n[^1]: \"dunder\" is short for \"double underscore\" and is a common way to refer to Python's protocols that are named with two leading and two trailing underscores", "Yes, this works perfectly. I have opened a PR #17575. I will update the changelog and add a test case shortly!", "Hi @astropy/core team \uD83D\uDC4B\nI'd love to help close out issue???#8860 (???enable both quantity_support and time_support in one go???). I saw PR???#17979 is already addressing this great start!\nI can help with:\n\nAdding unit tests (both context manager and decorator use cases)\nUpdating the visualization documentation\nWould it be helpful if I take this on next?", "Thanks for pointing out #17979, which we apparently missed entirely. We'd actually prefer to get both code and tests in the same PR, so I'd like to see if @elmostafa-abdelaal is still interested in this after month of not hearing back from us. In case there's no response (which would be understandable given the circumstances) after a reasonable amount of time (say a couple weeks at least), you (@Subham-KRLX) would be welcome to take this on, possibly starting from where things are now in #17979 and adding a test (but please don't forget to keep @elmostafa-abdelaal as a commit author if you do !). Thanks for your interest and patience. ", "Thanks for the update I totally understand waiting to hear back from @elmostafa-abdelaal it makes sense to give them first dibs since they???ve already put work into #17979.\nIf it???s helpful I am happy to:\nHelp draft tests/docs in the meantime (maybe start a WIP branch?),Jump in later if needed while crediting their commits or Just review whenever the PR moves forward.\nWhatever works best for the team just let me know." ],

Add Ruff configuration to `pyproject.toml` as included [here](https://github.com/beeware/toga/blob/780d1db68e68315ecc064c87caeca069692ca1b0/pyproject.toml#L53-L69)\n2. Add Ruff checks to `.pre-commit-config.yaml` as included [here](https://github.com/beeware/toga/blob/780d1db68e68315ecc064c87caeca069692ca1b0/.pre-commit-config.yaml#L12-L17)\n3. Remove the `[tool.isort]` configuration section from `pyproject.toml`. \n4. Remove `[flake8]` configuration section from `tox.ini`.\n5. Run `pre-commit run -a` in the repo directory, and let Ruff do any formatting or linting that it can do automatically.\n6. You will almost certainly end up with a list of errors, each identified by an error number.\n7. In this PR, you will not be making any significant code changes.\n8. Add a global `ignore` list to `pyproject.toml` in the `[tool.ruff.lint]` section, below the `extend-select` configuration section, including *only the rules that apply to this repository*. You can find an example of an `ignore` list [here](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/blob/1ffd045752d3a3d920a68d920201d890e8637e49/pyproject.toml#L255-L267). Include a comment next to the rule indicating what it relates to, as shown.\n9. Run `pre-commit run -a` to ensure that all the rules are being successfully ignored.\n10. Add `.ruff_cache` to the [`.gitignore` file](https://github.com/beeware/beeware/blob/main/.gitignore).\n11. There may be some minor code changes necessary because Flake8 and Black don't always agree; these changes should be kept to a minimum.\n12. Submit the pull request.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nNone.\n\n### Additional context\n\nOnce the initial PR is merged, the next step in this process is to begin working through resolving the errors indicated by the rules. \n\nEach rule begins with a letter or set of letters. Each set of rules that begins with the same letter or letters is related. For example, errors `B007`, `B018`, and `B904` are part of the same ruleset. \n\nEach set of related rules should be worked through together, and submitted as a separate PR for each set of related rules, i.e. submit a PR for the `BXXX` rules, and a separate PR for the `EXXX` rules.\n\nThe `SIMXXX` checks are explicitly disabled in the configuration. Do not remove the commented out `SIM` check, and avoid resolving the `SIMXXX` errors.\n",

So, doing periodic PINGs is correct, but rueidis already does that for you. If you want to do something else when there are connection issues, you can also monitor each redis response to see if it is a network error.", "Hi @rueian , thanks for your reply, I have modified the values of ReadBufferEachConn and WriteBufferEachConn, and the memory usage has been reduced to a very low value??????\nHowever, I would like to know why the default values of these two parameters need to be so large, and what their specific functions are? Will this memory be cleared?", "Those buffers help the client avoid unnecessary read and write system calls to the TCP connections when handling a large amount of concurrent requests and large pipelines.

      "description" : "### What is the problem or limitation you are having?\n\nThis repository currently uses Flake8/isort/Black for code linting and formatting.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nRuff should replace Flake8/isort/Black as the code linter and formatter.\n\nThis should be done as follows:\n1. Add Ruff configuration to `pyproject.toml` as included [here](https://github.com/beeware/toga/blob/780d1db68e68315ecc064c87caeca069692ca1b0/pyproject.toml#L53-L69)\n2. Add Ruff checks to `.pre-commit-config.yaml` as included [here](https://github.com/beeware/toga/blob/780d1db68e68315ecc064c87caeca069692ca1b0/.pre-commit-config.yaml#L12-L17)\n3. Remove the `[tool.isort]` configuration section from `pyproject.toml`. \n4. Remove `[flake8]` configuration section from `tox.ini`.\n5. Run `pre-commit run -a` in the repo directory, and let Ruff do any formatting or linting that it can do automatically.\n6. You will almost certainly end up with a list of errors, each identified by an error number.\n7. In this PR, you will not be making any significant code changes.\n8. Add a global `ignore` list to `pyproject.toml` in the `[tool.ruff.lint]` section, below the `extend-select` configuration section, including *only the rules that apply to this repository*. You can find an example of an `ignore` list [here](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/blob/1ffd045752d3a3d920a68d920201d890e8637e49/pyproject.toml#L255-L267). Include a comment next to the rule indicating what it relates to, as shown.\n9. Run `pre-commit run -a` to ensure that all the rules are being successfully ignored.\n10. Add `.ruff_cache` to the [`.gitignore` file](https://github.com/beeware/toga-chart/blob/main/.gitignore).\n11. There may be some minor code changes necessary because Flake8 and Black don't always agree; these changes should be kept to a minimum.\n12. Submit the pull request.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nNone.\n\n### Additional context\n\nOnce the initial PR is merged, the next step in this process is to begin working through resolving the errors indicated by the rules. \n\nEach rule begins with a letter or set of letters. Each set of rules that begins with the same letter or letters is related. For example, errors `B007`, `B018`, and `B904` are part of the same ruleset. \n\nEach set of related rules should be worked through together, and submitted as a separate PR for each set of related rules, i.e. submit a PR for the `BXXX` rules, and a separate PR for the `EXXX` rules.\n\nThe `SIMXXX` checks are explicitly disabled in the configuration. Do not remove the commented out `SIM` check, and avoid resolving the `SIMXXX` errors.\n",
