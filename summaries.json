      "description" : "### Describe the Bug\n\nThe Backup YAML example in [our doc website](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.9.0/snapshots-and-backups/backup-and-restore/create-a-backup) does not work. Because Longhorn mutator webhook requires providing [the correct `metadata.labels`](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn-manager/blob/16f796214eb359cdb9f9efbe577a2de68144081b/webhook/resources/backup/mutator.go#L63-L67) while the doc does not mention that.\n\nThere are 2 solutions for this:\n- Simply updating the doc by adding `metadata.labels` for the example YAMLs\n- The mutator should figure out and set up the labels automatically based on the input `spec.snapshotName`\n\nNow I may prefer the latter one since this solution can both\n- provide a better user experience\n- and forcibly ask the mutator to check the volume and snapshot existence before backup creation\n\n### To Reproduce\n\n1. Create and attach a volume\n2. Create a random snapshot\n3. Apply the following backup YAML provided by the doc:\n```\napiVersion: longhorn.io/v1beta2\nkind: Backup\nmetadata:\n  name: backup-example\n  namespace: longhorn-system\nspec:\n  backupMode: full\n  snapshotName: <volume snapshot name>\n  labels:\n    app: test\n```\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe backup should be created correctly\n\n### Support Bundle for Troubleshooting\n\n```\nubuntu:~$ kubectl apply -f backup.yaml\nError from server (InternalError): error when creating \"backup.yaml\": Internal error occurred: failed calling webhook \"mutator.longhorn.io\": failed to call webhook: post \"https://longhorn-admission-webhock.longhorn-system.svc:9502/v1/webhook/mutation?timeout=10s\": EOF\n```\n\n### Environment\n\n- Longhorn version: master-head (07/02/2025)\n\n### Additional context\n\nThis issue was found by community contributor @nzhan126  when she tried to test a backup-related fix. \n\n### Workaround and Mitigation\n\nSet up `matadata.labels` for the backup YAML. For example:\n```\napiVersion: longhorn.io/v1beta2\nkind: Backup\nmetadata:\n  name: backup-example\n  namespace: longhorn-system\n  labels:\n    backup-volume: <volume name>\nspec:\n  backupMode: full\n  snapshotName: <volume snapshot name>\n  labels:\n    app: test\n```\n",

These manual steps create friction for new users and go against Docker's principle of providing a complete, automated setup experience.\n\n## Current Manual Steps\n\nAfter running `docker-compose up --build -d`, users must manually execute:\n\n```bash\ndocker exec -it samarium_app npm run dev\ndocker exec -it samarium_app composer dump-autoload\ndocker exec -it samarium_app php artisan migrate\ndocker exec -it samarium_app php artisan key:generate\ndocker exec -it samarium_app php artisan storage:link\ndocker exec -it samarium_app php artisan db:seed\n```\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nThe Docker setup should be fully automated - users should only need to run:\n1. `cp .env.docker.example .env`\n2. `docker-compose up --build -d`\n\nAfter these commands, the application should be ready to use without any additional manual intervention.\n\n",

While it is not explicitly stored in the footer, it can be estimated by analyzing the number of pages via the `OrdinalIndex` and calculating the average page size.  \n\nIt might be worthwhile to include a few functions for inspecting a column's metadata.\n\nFurther more, we can also consider add these column stats into the optimizer statistics system, stored in the `_statistics_.column_statistics` table.\n\n",

As of now, Souvlaki leaves it up to the user to change the URL depending on the platform.\r\n\r\nFor Linux, we follow the MPRIS specification, which actually doesn't say much cover art apart from what's in [here](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/mpris-spec/metadata/#mpris:arturl). It only says that local files should start with `file://` and that it should be an UTF-8 string, which is enforced by Rust. Maybe you can look in the source code of desktop managers such as GNOME or KDE, since these read the field to display it on their media player controls.\r\n\r\nFor Windows, we use the _SystemMediaTransportControlsDisplayUpdater_, which has [a thumbnail property](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.media.systemmediatransportcontrolsdisplayupdater.thumbnail?view=winrt-22621#windows-media-systemmediatransportcontrolsdisplayupdater-thumbnail). It accepts multiple formats, but we choose to create it using an URI. If setting an URL starting with `file://`, the file is automatically loaded by souvlaki.\r\n\r\nFor MacOS, you can look into [these lines](https://github.com/Sinono3/souvlaki/blob/384539fe83e8bf5c966192ba28e9405e3253619b/src/platform/macos/mod.rs#L131-L137) of the implementation. These lines refer to creating an [MPMediaItemArtwork](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mediaplayer/mpmediaitemartwork) object.\r\n\r\nI hope this is of use to you. If you find a good way to put this information in the docs, consider opening a pull request \uD83D\uDE42", "Documented in 5b89e4bae455e5aed07e2f57f9d8a5b92e62ecf5", "As a FYI and because not much is documented in the respective platforms and at least verified on Linux-MPRIS-dbus-KDE, the format of `data:MIMETYPE;base64,BASE64DATA` seems to work without problems.\nAnd i have not yet seen complaints of it not working in windows, mac or other linux environments.\nBy the way, [mpv-mpris](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/mpv-mpris/) seems to also use this format on linux.\n\n[termusic souvlaki cover_art setting](https://github.com/tramhao/termusic/blob/4fa58b87f15f5d87f705de2b38998563d28ba480/playback/src/mpris.rs#L73-L91).\n[MDN data: URLs - URIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Reference/Schemes/data)", "> As a FYI and because not much is documented in the respective platforms and at least verified on Linux-MPRIS-dbus-KDE, the format of `data:MIMETYPE;base64,BASE64DATA` seems to work without problems.

If unavailable (e.g., in development), default to `Cartography/dev`.\n\n**Benefits**:\n\n* Easier debugging and tracing of requests in API logs\n* Improves compatibility with vendors that expect or validate user-agents\n* Aligns with standard HTTP client practices\n\n**Suggested implementation**:\n\n* Introduce a small utility (e.g., `build_session()`) in `cartography.util` to initialize a `requests.Session` with the appropriate `User-Agent`\n* Refactor existing intel modules to use this session instead of directly instantiating `requests.Session()`",

Update the task servers to remove the manual activation and deactivation. We do need to take some care that the instantiation of the interfaces then are ordered since some subscription callbacks might depend on some publishers activation or existence. So we should be creating all exporters (i.e. action clients, service clients, publishers) before  consumers (i.e. actions, services, subscribers) -- and deactivating all consumers before exporters (inverted). \n\nOn top, in the nav2 lifecycle node, we should autoactivate if the node is already activated when an interface is created (see `nav2::Publisher` for example)\n\n",

Since we only update the annotations in node's metadata, i think we can refactor it to use `Patch`.\n\n**Solution**:\n\n1. Please do some research to make sure that replacing `Update` with `Patch` does not change the behavior of current impl.\n2. If it is possible to using `Patch`, then refactor the code in this package. \n3. Pass the test in this package.\n4.

Yes we should definitly leave the get_uri method as it is (not get_url as it doesn’t exist yet) and implement a new get_url method which would then be called by the existing get_sqlalchemy_engine.\r\n\r\nYes, adding new method is the way to go. How to do it, should be proposed and discussed in the PR, we have 20+ sql providers, and I think the proposal should be complete and explain how to deal with cases that can/cannot be mapped. Also the method should explicily - IMHO - call our sqlalachemy, (`getSqlAlchemyURI` ?) and likely allow variations - from what I understand SQLAlchemy can have different URLs not only for different databases, but also for different drivers. Also some of our Connections allows to add different kinds of extras and parameters - not only hosts but other parameters that might be used and passed differently to different drivers.\r\n\r\nIf we decide to introduce a new \"standard\" method, in a product like Airflow and common API like DBApiHook, the proposal should provide answers to all the questions that users might ask in order to be mergable. It does not have to handle all of those but at least get enough error handlling and interface specification to explain what is the transition from the Connection form (in all those cases we have DBAPI implementation) -> SQLAlchemy URL.  Which variations are handled, how it should work, how to map engine args etc. \r\n\r\nI don't think it can be handled by a single implementation, it's more a scaffloiding + implementation for all the implementations and it should be designed nicely with al least a handful (if not all) implementation from the above list to be quite sure that we will be able to handle those cases. \r\n", "\r\n> Hey Andrey think there is some confusion here.

For example, instead of `/nix/store/<long string>/bin/.firefox-wrapped --name firefox`, I could configure it to just show `bin/firefox-wrapped --name firefox`.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nUsing a different distro would solve this but I don't wanna.\n\n**Additional context**\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c08d3137-e71b-492c-b81c-1c86827c9803)",

We need to add more to cover all the code in vllm-ascend, and there are several principles to follow:\n\n1. The overall file tree should be consistent with `vllm_ascend`\n2. The file name should be the original file name with a prefix `test_`\n3. Use `unittest` framework, make good use of mock\n4.

Check that no other contributor has already been assigned to this issue. If you believe that no one is actually working on it despite an assignment, ping the person. After one week without a response, the assignee may be changed.\n1. In the comments of this issue, request for it to be assigned to you, or just create a [pull request](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pulls) after following the steps below. [Mention](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) this issue in the description of the pull request.\n1. Fix the issue locally.\n1. [Run the test suite](https://llvm.org/docs/TestingGuide.html#unit-and-regression-tests) locally. Remember that the subdirectories under `test/` create fine-grained testing targets, so you can e.g. use `make check-clang-ast` to only run Clang's AST tests.\n1. Create a Git commit.\n1. Run [`git clang-format HEAD~1`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html#git-integration) to format your changes.\n1. Open a [pull request](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pulls) to the [upstream repository](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project) on GitHub. Detailed instructions can be found [in GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

Forked and cloned the repository, then searched the codebase for `readline` usage to find the core input handling logic.\n2.  Identified `useKeypress.ts` (for raw keypress events) and `InputPrompt.tsx` (for input logic) as the key files.\n3.  To see what the application receives, I temporarily modified the code to log every keypress event to a `debug.log` file.\n4.  **Key Finding:** My initial debugging proved that on a default macOS Terminal, `Shift+Enter` sends the exact same sequence (`\\r`) as a regular `Enter` press, making the two indistinguishable.\n\n### Attempted Fix & The Final Discovery\n\nBased on the initial finding, I attempted a code-only fix by teaching the application to listen for a different key combination, `Shift+Down`, which often sends a unique sequence on other terminals.\n\n1. The Code I Tested\nI modified `useKeypress.ts` to listen for the `Shift+Down` sequence (`\\x1b[1;2B`) and `InputPrompt.tsx` to handle a `key.shift` flag.\n\n```typescript\n// In useKeypress.ts, I added a check:\nif (key.sequence === '\\x1b[1;2B') {\n  key.name = 'return';\n  key.shift = true;\n}\n```\n```typescript\n// In InputPrompt.tsx, I added the key.shift check:\nif (key.ctrl || key.meta || key.shift || charBefore === '\\\\' || key.paste) {\n  // ... newline logic\n}\n```\n\n2. The Result: It Also Failed\nThis proof-of-concept did not work. To understand why, I used the `cat` command to see what my terminal was actually sending when I pressed `Shift+Down`.\nFinal Proof: The terminal sent `^[[B`, which is the standard escape code for a plain Cursor Down key.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis investigation leads to a definitive conclusion: the default macOS Terminal is more limited than anticipated. It appears to strip the `Shift` modifier information from both the `Enter` key and the arrow keys, making a code-only fix for a `Shift+Key` newline combination unfeasible on this specific platform, although i think this might work on other platforms which by default register shift + down as '\\x1b[1;2B' but i cant really test it.\n\nThis might explain why `Ctrl+J` is a common suggested alternative, as it sends a universal newline character (`\\n`) that doesn't rely on modifier key parsing.\n\nAs this is my first contribution, my analysis could be wrong, and I apologize for the detailed-but-failed attempt. Given these findings, what is the desired path forward? Any information from the internal `b.corp.google.com` link about how other terminals are supported would still be very helpful.\n\nThank you for your time and guidance.", "Just to add, I personally use the Warp Terminal on Mac. By default, Warp allows you to add a new-line using either of the following:\n\n* ⇧ + ↵ Enter\n* ⌥ + ↵ Enter\n\nBut once you are running Gemini, it doesn't work with either approach.

This can result in a token length that exceeds the limits set by the system. Here are some steps you can take to address this issue:您在使用 Dify 中的 Volcengine 插件时遇到的 \"标记太长 \"错误可能与处理大数据输入（如转换为 base64 编码的图像）有关。这可能导致标记长度超出系统设置的限制。以下是解决此问题的一些步骤：\n> \n> 1. **Reduce Image Size**: Try reducing the size of the images before uploading them to Dify. This can help prevent the base64 encoded data from exceeding the token limit.**减小图片大小 **：在将图片上传到 Dify 之前，请尝试减小图片大小。这有助于防止 base64 编码数据超出令牌限制。\n> 2. **Check Token Limits**: Ensure that the token limits for your model and API requests are configured correctly. Dify imposes a generation length limit of 2k tokens for reasoning models, which might be relevant if your workflow involves such models [[1]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/17120).**检查令牌限制 **：确保正确配置模型和 API 请求的令牌限制。Dify 为推理模型规定了 2k 标记的生成长度限制，如果您的工作流涉及此类模型，则可能与此相关 [[1]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/17120) 。\n> 3. **Switch Model Provider**: If you're using the `openai_api_compatible` provider, consider switching to a different model provider that might handle larger token sizes more effectively [[2]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/18657).**切换模型提供程序 **：如果您正在使用 `openai_api_compatible` 提供程序，请考虑切换到不同的模型提供程序，这样可以更有效地处理更大的标记大小 [[2]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/18657) 。\n> 4. **Review Workflow Configuration**: Double-check your workflow configuration to ensure that all parameters and settings are optimized for handling the data sizes you're working with.**审查工作流程配置 **：仔细检查您的工作流程配置，确保所有参数和设置都经过优化，以处理您正在处理的数据大小。\n> \n> By implementing these suggestions, you should be able to mitigate the \"token too long\" error and improve the stability of your plugin operations.通过实施这些建议，您应该可以减少 \"标记太长 \"错误，并提高插件运行的稳定性。\n> \n> _To continue talking to [Dosu](https://dosu.dev), mention [@dosu](https://github.com/dosu).要继续与 [Dosu](https://dosu.dev) 通话，请提及 。_\n> \n> Help Dosu learn!

      "description" : "We are in the process of moving this repository to Read the Docs, and to do that we need to convert our pages from Markdown to RST. This issue is to transfer the Onboarding section: [https://contribute.mautic.org/on-boarding](https://contribute.mautic.org/on-boarding). You can also update and improve the content on these pages if you like - do check with the team leads first to ensure it's relevant.\r\n\r\nYou can do this in the current repo, as we've got a folder set up, `/docs`, which will be used for Read The Docs.\r\n\r\nYou can build this documentation locally by cloning this repository, and following these steps: https://github.com/mautic/user-documentation/tree/5.x?tab=readme-ov-file#build-documentation-locally. Change into the /docs folder and then (assuming you have DDEV and Docker/Colima installed) type `ddev config` and select `build/html `as the root folder when configuring DDEV. Then when complete, type `ddev start` and it'll give you the link to your local testing environment.\r\n\r\nIf you need to make a link file to add an external URL, please use the command line tool 'make link'. This will generate a reference macro and a link file for you.\r\n\r\nFor internal linking check the docs on using the [:ref: role](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/cross-referencing-with-sphinx.html#the-ref-role) for linking within the same document, and using [:doc: to link across pages](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/cross-referencing-with-sphinx.html#the-doc-role).\r\n\r\n**Please note: if you see folders called .revs these are old version control files from Grav. Ignore them! (they should be deleted) and instead work on the actual files.**\r\n\r\nWhen you've converted the file/s, **they need to live within the /docs folder**. We can create a structure using sub-folders to organise the sections. You also need to add the pages to the Table of Contents in the index.rst file for them to show on the menu. Docs on the ToC can be found [here](https://sublime-and-sphinx-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/indices.html).\r\nWe highly recommend that you use VS Code with Vale installed. Let us know if you have any problems.\r\n\r\nSome useful resources: \r\n- https://sublime-and-sphinx-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest guide to Sphinx/RST formatting\r\n- https://sublime-and-sphinx-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/references.html#use-the-external-links-extension how to do external links - always check the /docs/links directory first! You can use the terminal command '`make link`' to create the link file automagically.\r\n\r\nThere are many MD to RST tools out there which can help speed up the process, however you will still need to review your output to ensure it passes our Vale grammar rules. Headings must always be unique, as well.\r\n\r\nWe use the following for headings:\r\n\r\n```\r\nH1 ###\r\nH2 ***\r\nH3 ===\r\nH4 ---\r\nH5 ~~~\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease ask in #t-education on Slack if you get stuck with anything!",

As a response, we are porting crash commands to drgn, adding a `--drgn` option to onboard users to drgn's more advanced functionality.\n\n# Contributing\n\nThe porting process is being tracked in https://github.com/users/osandov/projects/2. If you would like to work on a command, comment here (or reach out to @osandov) and we will create a new issue to track that command. Commands with many options can be split up further.\n\nCurrently, this work is in the `commands` branch, which is still a work in progress and will be rebased often. It will eventually be merged into the `main` branch.\n\n# Guidelines\n\n* The output format and behavior of each crash command should be recreated relatively closely in order to prioritize onboarding for crash users. However, we can deviate from crash if needed.\n* New functionality should be added as drgn helpers as much as possible. Ideally, commands should mainly call helpers and format output.\n* Every command should have a `--drgn` option that prints how to do the equivalent operation using drgn APIs.\n* Commands should be added to modules under `drgn/commands/_builtin/crash`. Feel free to create a new module if appropriate.\n* Test cases should be added under `tests/linux_kernel/crash_commands` for every command. Since most functionality should be in helpers with thorough unit tests, test cases for commands can be basic smoke tests.\n\nSee `_crash_cmd_mount()` in `drgn/commands/crash/_builtin/fs.py` and `TestMount` in `tests/linux_kernel/crash_commands/test_fs.py` for examples.",

      "description" : "**1. Overview:**\n\nEnsure robust and up-to-date integration of the OpenAI API as a core LLM provider within the `voltagent` framework, utilizing the official `openai` Node.js SDK. This involves verifying support for the latest OpenAI models (GPT-4, GPT-3.5 variants), features (like tool calling, JSON mode), and ensuring the implementation aligns perfectly with the `LLMProvider` interface and `voltagent` conventions.\n\n**2. Goals:**\n\n*   Implement or verify a dedicated `OpenAIProvider` class adhering to the `LLMProvider` interface.\n*   Support core generation functionalities (`generateText`, `streamText`, `generateObject`, `streamObject`) using OpenAI models.\n*   Utilize the latest official `openai` Node.js SDK.\n*   Correctly map `voltagent` generation options (model, temperature, max tokens, tool choice, etc.) to OpenAI API parameters.\n*   Implement robust support for OpenAI's tool calling mechanism, mapping seamlessly to `voltagent`'s tool definition and execution flow.\n*   Support OpenAI's JSON mode for reliable structured output generation (`generateObject`/`streamObject`).\n*   Handle authentication using OpenAI API keys.\n*   Integrate OpenAI-specific error handling and response parsing.\n\n**3. Proposed Architecture & Components:**\n\n*   **`OpenAIProvider`:** A class (potentially existing but needing review/update) within `agent/providers` implementing `LLMProvider`. It should:\n    *   Use the official `openai` Node.js library.\n    *   Handle API client initialization (API key, potentially base URL for proxies).\n    *   Implement `generateText`, `streamText`, `generateObject`, `streamObject`, correctly formatting requests (messages, tools, model parameters) and parsing responses/streams.\n    *   Specifically handle the `tool_calls` and `tool_results` message flow for tool usage.\n*   **Provider Registration:** Ensure `OpenAIProvider` is correctly registered and selectable.\n*   **Configuration:** Allow users to select 'openai' as the provider, specify models (e.g., 'gpt-4-turbo', 'gpt-3.5-turbo'), and provide API keys.\n*   **Tool Mapping:** Refine the logic that translates `voltagent` tool definitions into the format expected by the OpenAI API's `tools` parameter and processes `tool_calls` responses.\n\n**4. Affected Core Modules:**\n\n*   `agent/providers`: `OpenAIProvider` class implementation/refinement.\n*   `agent/types`: Ensure types accurately reflect OpenAI's request/response structures, especially for tools.\n*   `ToolManager`: Interaction with `OpenAIProvider` for formatting tool definitions and handling tool calls.\n*   `Agent`/`Agent Options`: Configuration for provider selection, models, and credentials.\n*   Requires the `openai` dependency.\n\n**5. Acceptance Criteria (Initial MVP / Refinement):**\n\n*   Users can configure an `Agent` to use `OpenAIProvider` with various GPT models (e.g., GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-3.5 Turbo) and an API key.\n*   `agent.generateText()` and `agent.streamText()` work correctly.\n*   `agent.generateObject()` and `agent.streamObject()` utilize OpenAI's JSON mode successfully.\n*   Agents can reliably use tools defined in `voltagent`, with requests and responses correctly handled via the OpenAI tool calling API.\n*   Relevant options (temperature, max tokens, tool choice) are passed correctly.\n*   Integration uses the current version of the official `openai` SDK.\n*   Documentation reflects the updated/verified OpenAI integration details.\n\n**6. Potential Challenges & Considerations:**\n\n*   Keeping up with frequent updates and changes in the OpenAI API and SDK.\n*   Ensuring the tool calling implementation is robust and handles various edge cases (multiple tool calls, errors).\n*   Mapping `voltagent`'s internal state/history accurately to the sequence of messages expected by OpenAI, especially when including tool results.\n*   Handling differences in behavior or features across different OpenAI models.\n*   Cost management and monitoring token usage for OpenAI API calls.",

For instance if the network is congested and the tx was evicted, then we likely just need to retry and continue to use the fee estimator to get a more up to date fee. If our account is out of funds to pay for gas however, retrying isn't going to do anything and we should return to the user. \n\nI'm not sure tbh how the TxClient handles this as is, but ideally we should reuse that logic as much as possible. Meaning, if we can treat each chunk in a similar way to a single chunk, and retry/return to the user in the same ways, that seems like a great start.", "> we should likely retry, however it depends on the reasoning for the failure.

If our account is out of funds to pay for gas however, retrying isn't going to do anything and we should return to the user.\n\nGotcha.

Users need to specifically opt into using the splitting for now as that is signing and submitting multiple txs. Presumably it would do so using existing submission logic.\n\nfwiw, we just started work on the TxClient to improve handling failures, so we don't need to write any additional failure handling logic with splitting.\n" ],

      "description" : "### \uD83E\uDDED Epic\n\n**Title:** Configurable Connection-Retry Back-off for Database & Redis  \n**Goal:** Prevent gateway startup failures caused by slow-to-start services by making retry limits and intervals fully configurable. \n**Why now:** In containerised deployments Postgres (or any other SQL backend) and Redis often take several seconds to accept TCP connections. Today the gateway gives up on the first failure, crashing with `psycopg2.OperationalError: connection … refused`. Operators need a simple way—via environment variables, just like `DB_POOL_SIZE`, `CACHE_TYPE`, etc.—to tune how many times and how often the gateway retries before aborting.\n\n---\n\n### \uD83E\uDDED Type of Feature\n\n- [x] Enhancement to existing functionality\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDE4B‍♂️ User Story 1\n\n**As a:** DevOps engineer running MCP Gateway in Kubernetes  \n**I want:** to set `DB_MAX_RETRIES` and `DB_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS` for any SQLAlchemy-backed database  \n**So that:** the application patiently waits until the database container is ready, instead of crashing and restarting in a loop\n\n#### ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n```gherkin\nScenario: Database retries during startup\nGiven MCP Gateway starts with DB_MAX_RETRIES=10 and DB_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS=5000\nAnd the database is not yet ready\nWhen the first connection attempt fails\nThen the gateway should log \"DB connection failed (attempt 1/10), retrying in 5 s\"\nAnd it should retry every 5 s\nAnd after 10 failed attempts it should exit with a clear error message\n```\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDE4B‍♂️ User Story 2\n\n**As a:** Site Reliability Engineer using Redis caching  \n**I want:** analogous knobs `REDIS_MAX_RETRIES` and `REDIS_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS`  \n**So that:** the gateway’s cache layer behaves consistently with the database layer\n\n#### ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n```gherkin\nScenario: Redis retries respect custom settings\nGiven REDIS_MAX_RETRIES=15 and REDIS_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS=2000\nAnd Redis is unavailable\nWhen the cache subsystem initialises\nThen it must retry up to 15 times at 2 s intervals\nAnd surface a single aggregated error if all attempts fail\n```\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDE4B‍♂️ User Story 3\n\n**As a:** Platform administrator  \n**I want:** sensible defaults (3 retries × 2000 ms) so I don’t have to set anything for typical installs  \n**So that:** small deployments gain resilience out-of-the-box\n\n#### ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n```\n\nScenario: Defaults work when variables are unset\nGiven none of the four *_RETRIES or *_INTERVAL_MS variables are set\nWhen the gateway cannot reach the database\nThen it retries 3 times with 2 s between attempts\n\n```\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDCD0 Design Sketch (optional)\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\nsubgraph Settings\nENV[\".env / ENV vars\"]\nend\nENV --> Config[config.py load Settings]\nConfig -->|DB config| DBClient[SQLAlchemy Engine]\nConfig -->|Cache config| RedisClient[Redis Async Client]\n\nDBClient --> RetryLogic\nRedisClient --> RetryLogic\n\nRetryLogic{{\"Retry up to N timesnsleep(interval_ms)\"}}\nRetryLogic --> Logger\n```\n\n| Component | Change | Detail |\n|----------|--------|--------|\n| `config.py` | Add four `@env_settings` fields | `db_max_retries:int=3`, `db_retry_interval_ms:int=2000`, `redis_max_retries:int=3`, `redis_retry_interval_ms:int=2000` |\n| `db.py` | Wrap DB connect logic in retry loop | Use `asyncio.sleep()` for interval |\n| Redis cache init | Retry connect with same config | Applies if `CACHE_TYPE=redis` |\n| Logging | One log per retry attempt | Include attempt count and retry delay |\n| README | Add env var docs | Match style of existing DB/Redis config\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDD17 MCP Standards Check\n\n- [x] No protocol-level breaking changes\n- [x] Follows existing env var config conventions\n- [ ] Deviations: none\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDD04 Alternatives Considered\n\n| Alternative | Pros | Cons |\n|------------|------|------|\n| `docker-compose` healthcheck + `depends_on` | Simple for local dev | Doesn’t help bare-metal or k8s |\n| Exponential back-off | Faster in some cases | Adds complexity |\n| Gunicorn retry preload script | Works for some runners | Not general-purpose\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDCD3 Additional Context\n\n- Mirrors retry pattern used in `max_tool_retries`\n- Naming aligned with `DB_POOL_SIZE`, `CACHE_TYPE`, etc.\n- Ensure this is then changed in the helm chart.\n\nExample configuration:\n\n```bash\nexport DB_MAX_RETRIES=10\nexport DB_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS=5000\nexport REDIS_MAX_RETRIES=10\nexport REDIS_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS=5000\n```\n",

      "description" : "We are in the process of moving this repository to Read the Docs, and to do that we need to convert our pages from Markdown to RST. This issue is to transfer the Marketing team section: [https://contribute.mautic.org/marketing-team](https://contribute.mautic.org/marketing-team). You can also update and improve the content on these pages if you like - do check with the team lead (cc @sdoering and @tobsowo) first to ensure it's relevant.\r\n\r\nYou can do this in the current repo, as we've got a folder set up, `/docs`, which will be used for Read The Docs.\r\n\r\nYou can build this documentation locally by cloning this repository, and following these steps: https://github.com/mautic/user-documentation/tree/5.x?tab=readme-ov-file#build-documentation-locally. Change into the /docs folder and then (assuming you have DDEV and Docker/Colima installed) type `ddev config` and select `build/html `as the root folder when configuring DDEV. Then when complete, type `ddev start` and it'll give you the link to your local testing environment.\r\n\r\nIf you need to make a link file to add an external URL, please use the command line tool 'make link'. This will generate a reference macro and a link file for you.\r\n\r\nFor internal linking check the docs on using the [:ref: role](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/cross-referencing-with-sphinx.html#the-ref-role) for linking within the same document, and using [:doc: to link across pages](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/cross-referencing-with-sphinx.html#the-doc-role).\r\n\r\n**Please note: if you see folders called .revs these are old version control files from Grav. Ignore them! (they should be deleted) and instead work on the actual files.**\r\n\r\nWhen you've converted the file/s, **they need to live within the /docs folder**. We can create a structure using sub-folders to organise the sections. You also need to add the pages to the Table of Contents in the index.rst file for them to show on the menu. Docs on the ToC can be found [here](https://sublime-and-sphinx-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/indices.html).\r\n\r\nWe highly recommend that you use VS Code with Vale installed. Let us know if you have any problems.\r\n\r\nSome useful resources: \r\n- https://sublime-and-sphinx-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest guide to Sphinx/RST formatting\r\n- https://sublime-and-sphinx-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/references.html#use-the-external-links-extension how to do external links - always check the /docs/links directory first! You can use the terminal command '`make link`' to create the link file automagically.\r\n\r\nThere are many MD to RST tools out there which can help speed up the process, however you will still need to review your output to ensure it passes our Vale grammar rules. Headings must always be unique, as well.\r\n\r\nWe use the following for headings:\r\n\r\n```\r\nH1 ###\r\nH2 ***\r\nH3 ===\r\nH4 ---\r\nH5 ~~~\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease ask in #t-education on Slack if you get stuck with anything!",

This is not an acceptable UI, especially for core site functionality like upvoting.\n\n@ninakali Could you share which tool and setting you used to produce the screenshots? I've used a few over the years and would like to be certain we don't accidentally test with one that doesn't accurately reproduce your problem. The easiest way to ensure that would be to reuse.\n\nImplementor: If it's possible, I'd prefer not to change the 'brand' red upvoted color as it's core UI, though that's secondary to a functional UI. Or to say the reverse, maybe the best first approach would be to lighten the unvoted gray (though this may start looking like a disabled form element) or an outline.\n\n\nTo connect some context: \n\n#1494 is related and could be done with or separately from this fix. There is even an [insufficiently concerned](https://github.com/lobsters/lobsters/issues/1494#issuecomment-2740754925) comment from me that the proposal might not be accessible; I didn't consider the existing UI.\n\n#1090 is also about this UI but may be stale, I'll post more info there.", "I asked for help with this [in chat](https://lobste.rs/chat) and got a suggestion that's deploying now.

It is difficult to find the mode that would reflect my experience the best. In theory, I have protanomaly, that makes red shades appear less bright and \"green-ish\", but in practice, an image with \"protanomaly\" filter still looks somewhat different to an image without any filters. \"Achromatomaly\" mode looked right because I couldn't quite tell the difference between the image with this filter and without it under the light conditions I've had in my room at the moment. \n\nSide note: I feel like \"true tone\" setting set to \"On\" in MacOS might affect how I see colours. This is a default setting, so I prefer to keep it as is." ],

This small error occurs when you first install on a system via a new bat file.\n\n### Steps to help reproduce the behavior\n\nDownload the latest release with ready to run bat-files, unzip, and first run file \"run start_windows.bat\".\n\n### Relevant logs\n\nThe first installation is interrupted. But if you run the bat-file again, the script skips the installation and just correct displays “ Disclaimer”.\n\n(The installation log has been created with the required name).\n[downloader.log](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21023120/downloader.log)\n\n### Operating system/environment\n\nWindows 11 23h2\n\n### Python Version\n\n3.13.5\n\n### Cyberdrop-DL version\n\n7.0.0\n\n### Links, references, and/or additional comments?\n\nThanks for work!",

This increased use should bring more contributions as bug reports and feature proposals.\n\n### Regression test\n(Ensure the feature doesn't cause any regressions)\n- [ ] Write adequate test cases and submit test results\n- [ ] Test results should be reviewed by a person from the team\n\n### Links / references\n\n_Please note that this was taken from GitLab, to be changed accordingly_",

      "description" : "## Is your feature request related to a use case or problem? Please explain\n\nParameterization requires a bunch of boilerplate (`_is_parameterized_`, `_parameter_names_`, `_resolve_parameters_`, all of which just check / replace the specified member variables). It seems like something a decorator could handle well.\n\n## Describe the solution you would prefer\n\nIt'd be great if in #5985, the solution could just be \"add the decorator to `QasmUGate`\", something like \n\n```python\n@parameterizable(\"theta\", \"phi\", \"lmda\")\nclass QasmUGate(ops.Gate):\n```\n\n## How urgent is this for you? Is it blocking important work?\n\n<!-- Please choose one of the following options and remove the others -->\n**P3** – I'm not really blocked by it; it's an idea I'm proposing based on principle\n\n## Process Note\n\nFor anyone wanting to take this issue, it's probably worth a mini [RFC](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/main/docs/dev/rfc_process.md) and finding a maintainer (not me) to sponsor it before starting work (assuming this even gets to triage/accepted state). While it's probably below the \"RFC Required\" bar, I think there are enough variables, that having an approved design would be beneficial. (Some things that come to mind: What happens if only some fields are parameterizable? Can/should it work both with dataclasses and with non-dataclasses? Can the implementations be overridden in classes it's applied to? How to apply it in gate class hierarchies (e.g. at the EigenGate level or at each subtype?) Does it interact with mypy typing in any way or are type declarations independent? What's the best way to test it? Is it worth going back and retrofitting existing gates into this model?)",

Please explain\n\n#6882 created a cache that sped up circuit construction if only \"append\" (or equivalent \"insert\" at end w/ EARLIEST strategy) was used. If other types of \"insert\", \"delete\", or any other circuit mutation was used (see instances of `_placement_cache = None`), the cache was simply deleted and subsequent mutations (including appends) fell back to the old \"check every moment\" algorithm.\n\n## Describe the solution you would prefer\n\nThere are probably some clever algorithms or data structures that could maintain the placement cache through more types of mutations. Or another option could be if the placement cache was deleted and subsequently the user calls a few \"appends\" in a row, to assume there are more coming and have some code that regenerates the placement cache a-priori. (It'd be nice to see some real-world use cases of large circuits that use mutations other than \"append\", to make sure any solution is optimizing the right thing).\n\n## How urgent is this for you? Is it blocking important work?\n\n<!-- Please choose one of the following options and remove the others -->\n**P3** – I'm not really blocked by it; it's an idea I'm proposing based on principle\n",

      "description" : "## Background\r\n\r\nWhen debugging anything related to a device driver, the first step is often finding the `struct device` that represents the device in the kernel. One way to find a device is by its sysfs path. However, drgn doesn't currently have an easy way to do that. You can _kind of_ do it with something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> path = path_lookup(\"/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:06.0/0000:04:00.0/nvme/nvme0/nvme0n1\")\r\n>>> kn = cast(\"struct kernfs_node *\", path.dentry.d_inode.i_private)\r\n>>> kobject = cast(\"struct kobject *\", kn.priv)\r\n>>> device = container_of(kobject, \"struct device\", \"kobj\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this has a few issues:\r\n\r\n* Clearly it's not convenient at all.\r\n* `path_lookup()` walks the dentry cache, which may not be populated for a particular path depending on memory pressure.\r\n* `path_lookup()` doesn't resolve symlinks (yet, see #216), so you have to use the canonical path instead of a more convenient symlink like `/sys/block/nvme0n1`.\r\n\r\nInstead, we should improve our kernfs helpers and provide sysfs-specific helpers on top of those. This can be broken down into multiple smaller features.\r\n\r\n## kernfs\r\n\r\nsysfs is actually an instance of [kernfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernfs_(Linux)), which is generic infrastructure for pseudo file systems. A kernfs filesystem comprises a tree of [`struct kernfs_node`](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/include/linux/kernfs.h?id=1d227fcc72223cbdd34d0ce13541cbaab5e0d72f#n181), each of which represents a file or directory.\r\n\r\nWe already have a few basic helpers for inspecting kernfs: https://drgn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/helpers.html#kernfs. I would like two extensions to those:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add a `kernfs_children()` helper that returns an iterator over the children of a directory in kernfs. Children are represented by [`struct kernfs_node::dir::children`](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/include/linux/kernfs.h?id=1d227fcc72223cbdd34d0ce13541cbaab5e0d72f#n156).\r\n- [ ] Extend the `kernfs_walk()` helper to follow symlinks. These are represented by [`struct kernfs_node::symlink::target_kn`](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/include/linux/kernfs.h?id=1d227fcc72223cbdd34d0ce13541cbaab5e0d72f#n171). We should probably also have a `follow_symlinks` parameter that controls what we do if the last component of a path is a symlink, similar to the Python [`os`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#files-and-directories) module.\r\n\r\n## sysfs\r\n\r\nOnce we have the kernfs changes, we can add sysfs-specific helpers that use the new kernfs features.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add a `sysfs_lookup_node()` helper that returns the `struct kernfs_node *` at a given path.\r\n- [ ] Add a `sysfs_lookup()` helper that returns the actual object (e.g., `struct device *`, `struct bus *`, etc.) represented by a given path.\r\n- [ ] Add a `sysfs_listdir()` helper that lists the names of the children of a sysfs directory at a given path.",

It also provided ability for companies to run scripts on the EC2 machines securely using it's RunCommand feature. Adding SSM RunCommand Operator to the Amazon provider package will unlock migration to Airflow from legacy job scheduling frameworks like AutoSys\n\n### Use case/motivation\n\nI work with a few customers that are in the process of migrating jobs from AutoSys and other legacy frameworks to Airflow. For these customers, a lot of their existing jobs are in shell scripts running on EC2. When they migrate to Airflow, they are looking for an easy way to lift those scripts and run on Airflow. SSHOperator could be an option for this but in many corporate environments, SSH is disabled for security reasons. One of the secure ways AWS recommends executing a remote script on EC2 is by using SSM RunCommand.\n\n### Related issues\n\n_No response_\n\n### Are you willing to submit a PR?\n\n- [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n",

Probably the hardest part is that unlike OIIO, OSL will need LLVM installed as a dependency. \r\n",

I ended up updating OpenImageIO to v2.6.2.0-dev since that is the one where the need for the boost dependency was removed.

A lot of this stuff has been pretty new to me coding wise, but I've been trying my best!", "Hi, I went back figured out how to get boost to build correctly, realized I needed to specify what msvc version I was using. Anyway after doing so I ended up only updating OpenImageIO and OpenEXR to slightly newer versions than what was listed in the original build_osl.py file because OSL was looking for Imath, but couldn't find it in ILMBase. So wanted to use a version of OpenEXR when Imath was seperated from it, and then add the same version of Imath as OpenEXR. I did so and got it to build, but again now with a different OpenImageIO version I still run into this same error:\r\n\r\nCreating library C:/madoodia/sdks/osl_release/build/OpenShadingLanguage/lib/Release/oslexec.lib and object C:/madoodia/sdks/osl_release/build/OpenShadingLanguage/lib/Release/oslexec.exp\r\nmaster.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol \"public: __cdecl OSL_v1_14_3::OSLCompiler::OSLCompiler(class OpenImageIO_v2_5::ErrorHandler *)\" (??0OSLCompiler@OSL_v1_14_3@@QEAA@PEAVErrorHandler@OpenImageIO_v2_5@@@Z) referenced in function \"public: void __cdecl OSL_v1_14_3::OSLCompiler::`default constructor closure'(void)\" (??_FOSLCompiler@OSL_v1_14_3@@QEAAXXZ) [C:\\madoodia\\sdks\\osl_release\\build\\OpenShadingLanguage\\src\\liboslexec\\oslexec.vcxproj]\r\nruntimeoptimize.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol \"public: __cdecl OSL_v1_14_3::OSLCompiler::OSLCompiler(class OpenImageIO_v2_5::ErrorHandler *)\" (??0OSLCompiler@OSL_v1_14_3@@QEAA@PEAVErrorHandler@OpenImageIO_v2_5@@@Z) [C:\\madoodia\\sdks\\osl_release\\build\\OpenShadingLanguage\\src\\liboslexec\\oslexec.vcxproj]\r\nllvm_instance.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol \"public: __cdecl OSL_v1_14_3::OSLCompiler::OSLCompiler(class OpenImageIO_v2_5::ErrorHandler *)\" (??0OSLCompiler@OSL_v1_14_3@@QEAA@PEAVErrorHandler@OpenImageIO_v2_5@@@Z) [C:\\madoodia\\sdks\\osl_release\\build\\OpenShadingLanguage\\src\\liboslexec\\oslexec.vcxproj]\r\nsymtab.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol \"public: __cdecl OSL_v1_14_3::OSLCompiler::OSLCompiler(class OpenImageIO_v2_5::ErrorHandler *)\" (??0OSLCompiler@OSL_v1_14_3@@QEAA@PEAVErrorHandler@OpenImageIO_v2_5@@@Z) [C:\\madoodia\\sdks\\osl_release\\build\\OpenShadingLanguage\\src\\liboslexec\\oslexec.vcxproj]\r\nC:\\madoodia\\sdks\\osl_release\\build\\OpenShadingLanguage\\bin\\Release\\oslexec.dll : fatal error LNK1120: 1 unresolved externals [C:\\madoodia\\sdks\\osl_release\\build\\OpenShadingLanguage\\src\\liboslexec\\oslexec.vcxproj]\r\n\r\nI tried also adding and setting the flags: \"-DLINKSTATIC=ON\", \"-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON\" to OpenImageIO but this didn't make a difference. I don't understand why this error persists. I'm also using OpenImageIO v2_5_11. So I know in the Install file for OSL it says it will work with v2_5, but wanted to check and make sure that if it's at the tail end of it, there wouldn't be issues (I wouldn't believe so, since this is the version that works with Blender currently).", "This is not an issue in your CI work, it's an actual problem in OSL where building shared libs is broken currently, oslexec does not link oslcomp, but does [something a bit naughty](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenShadingLanguage/blob/main/src/liboslexec/CMakeLists.txt#L143) and gets to the symbols it needs by including the required cpp files from oslcomp into the oslexec build. And seemingly it needs more symbols now, than it needed previously. \r\n\r\nWe ran into this today with the blender deps build (no fix as of yet), but this broke somewhere between 1.13.7.0 and the 1.14 beta \r\n\r\n", "Presumably caused by #1890.", "Potential fix in #1918, can someone check if it works?", "works\r\n ", "Okay sweet, and thanks. I will try pulling in the latest changes soon, and seeing if my CI completes it's build with that fix. How should I go about getting permission to push my commit with the updated CI? And I assume the one that uses the version of OpenImageIO that doesn't require boost, is the commit I should be pushing.", "Sorry for the wait on this. After getting the release version of the build setup and working, I moved onto the debug version but ran into some issues which came to a head at pybind11's debug build. This issue gave me a lot of trouble, and I meant to come back to it eventually for a better look later but got caught up in other work. \n\nAnyway I made mention of the issue in the commit I made on my own fork of the repo, but essentially a repeating error of \"IMPORTED_LOCATION not set for important target\" is given for a variety of targets such as: \"pybind11::module\", \"pybind11::thin_lto\", \"pybind11::windows_extras\", \"pybind11::pybind11\", etc.\n\nI believe the reason for this error may be resolved by editing the CMake code regarding pybind11, but if that is the solution then that is something I don't feel comfortable editing. Since all of my focus has been within the build_install directory, when I have had the time to work on this issue.\n\nI continued the debug build past pybind11 by removing it from the list of dependencies to build, and the other dependencies were able to build just fine including the final OSL build. There is one additional error regarding glut.h not being copied into the proper folder, but I gave a list of steps to follow regarding copying the file into it's correct folder (in the Readme). That file is needed by Partio, during it's build.\n\nBesides that I updated various versions of the dependencies, added IMath to build_osl.py, and updated the ReadMe for the build with this new information, including what dependencies needed to be installed by the user and which would automatically be installed by running the Release and Debug versions of the build_osl.bat script. Let me know if there's any other information you need, or anything regarding procedure In need to do for the commit of this issue.\n\nThanks,\nNate" ],

      "description" : "### Proposal summary\n\nWe like to extend the existing evaluation metrics to include a new metric called \"Trajectory Accuracy\". Esentially we are evaluating ReAct style agents by reasoning about the sequence of actions taken and their outcomes. Based on the paper “ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models” https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629. You can also see the Langchain implementation here:\n- https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/evaluation/langchain.evaluation.agents.trajectory_eval_chain.TrajectoryEvalChain.html\n- https://github.com/langchain-ai/agentevals/tree/main/python/agentevals/trajectory\n\nExample of an existing judge metric (Hallucination) is defined here:\n- Docs: https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/evaluation/metrics/hallucination\n- Docs Code: https://github.com/comet-ml/opik/blob/main/apps/opik-documentation/documentation/fern/docs/evaluation/metrics/hallucination.mdx\n- Python SDK: https://github.com/comet-ml/opik/tree/main/sdks/python/src/opik/evaluation/metrics/llm_judges/hallucination\n- Python Examples: https://github.com/comet-ml/opik/blob/main/sdks/python/examples/metrics.py\n- Frontend: https://github.com/comet-ml/opik/blob/main/apps/opik-frontend/src/constants/llm.ts\n\nIdeally this is implemented as an LLM-as-a-judge. Expectation is the new judge is added to the frontend for using LLM-as-a-judge from the UI (Online Evaluation tab) as well as in the Python SDK. The appropriate docs needs to be updated and a video attached of the metric working.\n\nReturn should be float (0-1), and if its using LLM as a eval then should also contain a \"reason/explanation\"\n\n### Motivation\n\nI would like to see more robust set of metrics and evaluations based on recent research.",

      "description" : "### Application\n\nOutline Manager\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nWhen using GCP option in \"ADD SERVER\" tab the app hangs on create server step. \nThe problem is connected to missing `projects/ubuntu-os-cloud/global/images/family/ubuntu-2004-lts` image that should be used when creating a compute engine instance. \n\nIn GCP logs for compute engine the following error message can be found:\n```\nThe resource 'projects/ubuntu-os-cloud/global/images/family/ubuntu-2004-lts' was not found\n```\nFor reference see [Operating system details](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/os-details#ubuntu_lts) section of Compute Engine Documentation. It clearly states that EOS and image deprecation date for tis image is May 2025. \n\nI suspect the error can be easily fixed by updating [this line](https://github.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-apps/blob/55d09c01704909e1142fd14e2a91d5525872efd0/server_manager/www/gcp_account.ts#L275), but I'm not sure what image is to be used (otherwise I could try to open a PR). \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. open Outline Manager\n2. connect to GCP account\n3. create a project using \"ADD SERVER\" tab\n4. create server using on of the locations (same behaviour is observed for multiple server locations)\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\nSuccessfully completed addition of new server as it was before.\n\n### What actually happened?\n\nI've tried to create a new GCP server using the respective option in \"ADD SERVER\" tab. \n\n### Outline Version\n\n1.17.2\n\n### What operation system are you using?\n\nmacOS\n\n### Operating System Version\n\nSonoma 14.6.1\n\n### Screenshots and Videos\n\n_No response_",

This is great.\n\nI've noticed in my own experimentation, plus reviewing these PRs, that my biggest concern is that we just don't have enough tests. A lot of code is untouched by the test suite. Codecov is not the perfect tool here, because it has a little trouble parsing fypp -> f90, so it marks some lines as not covered that are actually covered. Still, there are things like the output files, the probes, data transfer between simulation -> post_process, and so on. \n\nThe code is not so hard to refactor, but there are some areas that are concerning. I suspect that #914 is a side effect of me or someone else's PR (I could be wrong). This case simply wasn't tested in CI appropriately.\n\nThere is a tango required to get decent tests without overfitting to specific computers or spending 10 hours in CI running (plus another 10 hours queuing in some cases). But I would rather have good tests so we can more confidently refactor and add features than be cavalier about merging quite important changes into the code. \n\nAn example is #907 from @XZTian64 or #855 (and similar) from @Malmahrouqi3 and #901 from me. I'm not fully confident that nothing will go wrong in merging these, despite the tests. The ones that involve writing probes or post_process are most concerning at the moment, I think." ],

This causes:\n\n- Confusing validation errors\n- Two conflicting rollout sources\n- A broken mental model\n\n---\n\n### Proposed Fix (shown in the prototype)\n\n1. User adds a scheduled rollout via the **Schedule** tab.\n2. Only after selecting a date and time, the release condition fields appear (progressive disclosure).\n3. The **Overview** tab updates to clearly show the scheduled rollout date and percentage.\n\nThis makes the state clear, avoids user errors, and reinforces the schedule as the single source of truth.\n\nLet me know your thoughts! Happy to refine it!", "I like it! However, we don't allow editing a schedule.

The previous file with the old name should be deleted.\r\n\r\n**Tasks:**\r\n\r\n1. **Add the \"Rename\" button:**\r\n   - Place the \"Rename\" button between the ComboBox (preset selector) and the \"Delete\" button.\r\n   - Ensure the button is clearly labeled and fits within the existing layout.\r\n\r\n2. **Implement the popup modal:**\r\n   - Create a modal that appears when the \"Rename\" button is clicked.\r\n   - The modal should include:\r\n     - An input field for the new preset name.\r\n     - \"Confirm\" and \"Cancel\" buttons.\r\n   - The \"Confirm\" button should only be enabled if the input field is not empty.\r\n\r\n3. **Handle renaming logic:**\r\n   - Update the `presets.name` property with the new name when the user clicks \"Confirm\".\r\n   - Rename the corresponding preset file to match the new name and delete the old file.\r\n   - Ensure the file renaming is done safely, checking for any name conflicts or invalid characters.\r\n\r\n4. **Update the ComboBox selection and display:**\r\n   - Refresh the ComboBox options to reflect the updated preset name.\r\n   - Maintain the current selection in the ComboBox with the new name after renaming.\r\n\r\n5. **Test the renaming functionality:**\r\n   - Verify that the \"Rename\" button opens the modal correctly.\r\n   - Test renaming with various inputs (valid, invalid, empty, conflicting names).\r\n   - Confirm that the file is renamed correctly and the old file is deleted.\r\n   - Ensure the ComboBox updates to reflect the new name without issues.\r\n\r\n6. **Update documentation:**\r\n   - Document the new \"Rename\" functionality.\r\n   - Update any relevant sections of the user guide to explain how to rename presets.\r\n\r\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\r\n- The \"Rename\" button appears between the ComboBox and \"Delete\" button and functions as intended.\r\n- The popup modal asks the user for a new name, and the \"Confirm\" button only works when a valid name is provided.\r\n- The preset's name is updated both in the object (`presets.name`) and the corresponding file.\r\n- The previous file is deleted after renaming.\r\n- The ComboBox correctly displays the updated preset name.\r\n- Documentation is updated to reflect the new feature.\r\n\r\n**Additional Context:**\r\n- The project uses ImGui, and the modal should integrate seamlessly with the existing UI.\r\n- Ensure that renaming presets does not interfere with other functionalities like saving, loading, or deleting presets.",

      "description" : "### \uD83D\uDE80 The feature, motivation and pitch\n\nI want to add a unit test for AOTI testing if user_managed weights works with load_state_dict.\n\nIt can follow a similar test https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/test/inductor/test_aot_inductor.py#L5733-L5835, but the new test is supposed to be simpler. \n\nUser managed is the last bool passed into update_constant_buffer:\nhttps://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/d5d14ee823e70224a154884a5c2912643d648094/torch/_C/_aoti.pyi#L28\n\n# Motivation:\n\nAOTI will take in an eager (i.e. un-compiled)model and spit out a AOTI Model that is compiled. update_constant_buffer is an api to update the weights of such model. If we set user_managed=True, the new weights that we are passing in should just point to the tensors (i.e. no copy is done). So ideally, if we update the tensors we passed it, the changes should reflect on the AOTI model. This is already tested in test_update_user_managed_buffer.\n\nWhat I want to see tested is if we:\n1. pass in the model weights to AOTI model with user managed\n2. Update the eager model weights with load_state_dict\n3. Check if the update is reflected on the AOTI model.\n\n### Alternatives\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\ncc @chauhang @penguinwu @avikchaudhuri @gmagogsfm @zhxchen17 @tugsbayasgalan @angelayi @suo @ydwu4 @desertfire @chenyang78 @yushangdi @benjaminglass1",

Is it still relevant or not?", "From what I can tell, we could introduce a new configuration option to truncate large data fields within the ValueObject property. A good place to implement this might be here:\n\uD83D\uDC49 https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/blob/master/pkg/apis/application/v1alpha1/values.go#L34.\n\nIf the serialized data at this point (https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/blob/master/pkg/apis/application/v1alpha1/values.go#L20) is too large, we could truncate it accordingly.\n\nAdditionally, I'm considering introducing levels of truncation for deeply nested JSON structures. For this, we could add a --log-json-max-depth configuration flag. For example, if --log-json-max-depth=2, everything deeper than 2 levels would be replaced with a placeholder like \"...(truncated)\".\n\nGiven the following example:\n```\n{\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"name\": \"app\",\n    \"labels\": {\n      \"env\": \"prod\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"spec\": {\n    \"containers\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"nginx\",\n        \"resources\": {\n          \"limits\": {\n            \"cpu\": \"500m\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\nWith --log-json-max-depth=2, it would become:\n```\n{\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"name\": \"app\",\n    \"labels\": \"...(truncated)\"\n  },\n  \"spec\": {\n    \"containers\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"nginx\",\n        \"resources\": \"...(truncated)\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\nThis would allow users to control how much detail they want to include in logs, preventing overly verbose output while retaining useful context.

I wonder how much of that exists.\n\nHonestly, I still don't quite understand the relation between our color palettes and color tokens, when to use which, and what tokens map to which palettes.", "TL;DR - I agree, we need to have a stronger, clearer stance on this topic.\n\nRoughly speaking, what we see today is essentially the results of progressing from not having proper tokens to having them.\n- In the 'olden days', `euiPalette*` was a convenient way to obtain (or create on the fly!) an array of colors.\n- Now, we have tokens - colors specified with intent - and a naming convention that gets to the same result... a set(s) of colors _for data viz_\n\nWhere things got muddied is that these palettes were used sorta like faux tokens. Out of convenience, people began plucking out values and using them in non-dataviz use cases.\n\nThis topic will inevitably lead toward _\"Do we still need the palettes then?\"_\n- I would hash that out with the data viz experts.\n- Note that these palettes are also exposed to users when building visualizations so, in that regard, we may need to keep the component but be more restrictive on its use and guidelines." ],

Considering how often people ask about examples, I think it might make more sense to put one combined page on the main site, and potentially link to it from both docs. It would also then make sense, I imagine, to add a column for \"BeeWare component(s) used\". \n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nWe could still maintain separate pages, but I'm not sure if there's a good way to make sure they stay in sync with each other. It's also not clear, currently, from just looking at one, which of the apps also use the other.\n\nIf we do keep the individual pages, it seems redundant to mention that each app uses the tech in question.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

I disabled Windows search indexing on my Nextcloud directory because windows kept on downloading files I wanted to only keep online every time I searched for something in the parent folder.\n\nThe search function in the Nextcloud tray menu is able to find the desired sub folder, but clicking the folder only opens the containing folder and not the folder itself. This is useless to me because, as said, there are a lot of different folders and the folder names are too similar.\n\nIt looks like Nextcloud just opens the containing folder for folders or files. It would be nice if there was at least a context open to allow opening folder or files.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nOpen folder or file by default and have open containing folder the context menu option, but that risks messing with other people's workflow since open containing folder is the current behavior.",

No error message is shown to direct me to how to fix the issue.\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n1. Take an offer\n2. Send the collateral\n3. Attempt to submit an invoice with a small PPM to force failure\n4. Notice no message comes up\n5. Check the dev console and look at the failed call in the Network tab.\n6. Cry a little\n\n**Expected behavior**\nI expected that a failure would show a toast or something to tell me how to fix the problem. The message returned from the API has the information I would need. It just should be surfaced in the UI so I don't have to go looking through the Network tab to find the solution.\n\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\n - OS: PopOS\n - Browser: Tor Browser\n - Version: 14.5.4\n",

However, if I set up a rule to append to a note, no space is added between the note and added text. I'm ok with either behavior, but would prefer it to be consistent.\n\n### How can we reproduce the issue?\n\nSelect a transaction, bulk edit note, prepend or append, type anything in. You will notice a space is placed in between the old and new text.\n\nCreate a rule (or just use the rule editor to bulk edit) that prepends or appends to a note, run it, you'll see that no space is added.\n\n### Where are you hosting Actual?\n\nDocker\n\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\n\nChrome, Firefox\n\n### Operating System\n\nWindows 11",

      "comments" : [ "DataFlex uses a lot of different file extensions, some of which will likely have conflicts. Modern DataFlex uses a common workspace structure, such as `AppSrc/cMyClass.pkg`. Searching for [NOT is:fork path:Appsrc/**.pkg](https://github.com/search?type=code&q=NOT+is%3Afork+path%3AAppsrc%2F**.pkg\n) narrows it down to effectively DataFlex source code files and provides 900+ results. Many of the other file extensions are nowhere near that many, so it won't meet the minimum usage requirements.\n\nGiven that there are so many file extensions in use, maybe a better initial approach could be to add support for DataFlex without specifying `extensions` or `filenames` to avoid conflicts. And DataFlex source repositories can use `.gitattributes` overrides for the relevant extensions instead. Obviously not ideal, but it would at least provide recognition for the DataFlex language, and that's a great starting point.\n\nI see there is some precedence for languages without specifying file extensions, such as for Elvish transcripts from PR #6302, which is mainly used inside markdown files. @lildude and @NilsSve, I can help and put up a PR for adding the DataFlex language without specifying any file extensions, would that work?\n", "Hi Sonny,\n\nIf you are asking me, yes, that would help! The current repositories at @NilsSve are using .gitattributes exactly as suggested.", "> I see there is some precedence for languages without specifying file extensions, such as for Elvish transcripts from PR [#6302](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/pull/6302), which is mainly used inside markdown files. [@lildude](https://github.com/lildude) and [@NilsSve](https://github.com/NilsSve), I can help and put up a PR for adding the DataFlex language without specifying any file extensions, would that work?\n\nIt would \"work\" but it won't be accepted. The Elvish exception is because there isn't a common extension as it's predominantly used in a markdown files. This is not the case with DataFlex.\n\nI know nothing about DataFlex but wikipedia says \"DataFlex is an object-oriented high-level programming language and a fourth generation visual tool for developing Windows, web and mobile software applications on one framework-based platform.\"\n\nWe do not add support for frameworks, hence we support Ruby, but not Rails, so the right thing to do is concentrate on only the language files. I'd expect the language to have a common extension and structure that can be identified.  This should be what is added first, assuming usage meets requirements, and then users can use the overrides to classify the other extensions if they want.\n\nIf the language predominantly uses a generic extension like `.pkg` (poor design decision IMO), this can be added the `generic.yml` file and a heuristic will be used to identify the language, but be warned: this heuristic _must_ be very accurate to only identify DataFlex files and must be linear and performant. It's better for this regex to under identify DataFlex files than misidentify other languages.", "> It would \"work\" but it won't be accepted. The Elvish exception is because there isn't a common extension as it's predominantly used in a markdown files. This is not the case with DataFlex.\n\nI see. That makes sense. DataFlex is an old language that's been around in its current object-oriented form for 20+ years. Its use is mainly for database business applications, for Windows and web apps. It unfortunately doesn't have a single dedicated file extension, and the convention is to use one of a set of extensions representing the main purpose of the specific DataFlex source file. Such as `.vw` for a view, and other extensions for database business logic etc. The `.pkg` extension is typically used for reusable classes, which is why it's the predominant extension seen on GitHub.\n\n> If the language predominantly uses a generic extension like .pkg (poor design decision IMO), this can be added the generic.yml file and a heuristic will be used to identify the language, but be warned: this heuristic must be very accurate to only identify DataFlex files and must be linear and performant. It's better for this regex to under identify DataFlex files than misidentify other languages.\n\nThat sounds like a great idea, thanks! I will pursue this strategy for the `.pkg` file extension since it's the most commonly used extension. I'll follow the instructions and add it to `generic.yml` with heuristics and tests. Thanks again!", "And may I add that DataFlex has two frameworks. One for Windows and one for the Web, with overlaps between them for datadictionaries for consistent database behaviour.\n\nHowever, the frameworks are not optionals/add-ons like in many other languages. Instead they are an integrated part of the DataFlex language. And they are written in the DataFlex language.\n\nSure, a web-based DataFlex application also uses javascript libraries and many other parts needed for a modern webapp, but those files are not part of the frameworks. The build in frameworks are more guided towards how to develop applications more easy, fluently and make the code more robust and easier to follow." ],

These enhancements aim to improve how citizens interact with the issue reporting and tracking flow.\n\n---\n\n## 1. \uD83D\uDCCB Copy Issue Link Button\n\n### Problem\nThere’s currently no easy way to share a direct link to a specific issue.\n\n### Solution\n- Add a **copy-to-clipboard** button (copy icon) near each issue title.\n- Clicking it should copy the full permalink of the issue (e.g., `https://civix.app/issues/42`) to the user’s clipboard.\n- Display a **toast notification** confirming the action.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```jsx\n<IssueHeader>\n  <h2>{issue.title}</h2>\n  <CopyLinkButton issueId={issue.id} />\n</IssueHeader>\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2. \uD83C\uDF89 Submission Confirmation\n\n### Problem\nAfter reporting an issue, users aren’t clearly informed about success or what to do next.\n\n### Solution\n- Show a **modal popup** confirming successful submission.\n- Include the **new issue ID** (e.g., Issue #42).\n- Offer two clear next steps:\n  - ✅ View the reported issue\n  - ➕ Report another issue\n\n### Mock Layout\n\n```\n+-----------------------------+\n|  \uD83C\uDF89 Thank You!             |\n|  ✓ Issue #42 reported!     |\n|                             |\n|  [ View Issue ] [ Report Another ] |\n+-----------------------------+\n```\n\n---\n\n## 3. \uD83D\uDD22 Smart Character Counters\n\n### Problem\nUsers can’t see how many characters they’ve typed or how close they are to a limit.\n\n### Solution\n- Add **live character counters** to all long-text input fields (e.g., description).\n- Use color indicators:\n  - \uD83D\uDFE2 Normal (< 80%): gray text (`text-gray-500`)\n  - \uD83D\uDFE0 Near Limit (≥ 80%): orange text (`text-orange-500`)\n  - \uD83D\uDD34 Over Limit: red text (`text-red-600`)\n- Set configurable limits (e.g., 500 characters).\n\n### Example UI States\n\n| State       | Color         | Example        |\n|-------------|---------------|----------------|\n| Normal      | Gray          | `45 / 500`     |\n| Near Limit  | Orange        | `410 / 500`    |\n| Over Limit  | Red           | `502 / 500`    |\n\n---\n\n## \uD83E\uDDEA Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] All features work correctly in **both Light and Dark modes**\n- [ ] Fully **mobile-responsive**\n- [ ] No regressions or broken functionality\n- [ ] (Optional) Components added to **Storybook** if applicable\n- [ ] Code includes clear, maintainable structure with reusable components\n\n---\n\n## \uD83E\uDDF0 Tech Notes\n\n- Copy button may use [`navigator.clipboard.writeText()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clipboard/writeText)\n- Toasts can use an existing toast component or [React Hot Toast](https://react-hot-toast.com/)\n- Character counter can be a custom hook or inline logic for now\n\n---\n\n## \uD83D\uDCCC Related Areas\n\n- `IssueDetail.jsx`\n- `NewIssueForm.jsx`\n- `components/ui/Toast.jsx`\n- `components/ui/Modal.jsx`\n- `components/CharacterCounter.jsx` (to be created)\n\n---\n\n**Let’s ship these delightfully helpful improvements \uD83D\uDE80**\n",

Usually this occurs when an app is buggy and only sends the leaf certificate without its chain, and explicitly trusting the leaf's issuing intermediate CA seems to fix the problem for them. Crucially, when that intermediate is then rotated their app will break.\r\n\r\nWe could add a toggle, defaulting to false, such as `allowIntermediateCertificates`. If false, it would parse every certificate and ensure that it's self-signed. There might be other ways of achieving the same goal.\r\n\r\nHaving this in from the start could prevent so many misconfigurations by unsuspecting cluster admins.\r\n\r\n(Complication: If we added a list of publicly trusted certs it'd probably need to default to allowing intermediates in that list by default - but we could definitely default to disallowing intermediates everywhere else)",

      "description" : "<!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->\n<!--- If you believe the issue may have security implications, please report it as a vulnerability -->\n<!--- Report a vulnerability: https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/security -->\n\nWe are currently re-working our network policies by introducing GlobalNetworkSets. We have labeled each network set with something like `networking.our.internal.stuff/networkset: <name>` to be able to select a single network set in our network policies. We are concerned that someone accidentally adds the same label to a pod or another resource and thus undermines our network policies.\n\n## Expected Behavior\n<!--- If you're describing a bug, tell us what should happen -->\n<!--- If you're suggesting a change/improvement, tell us how it should work -->\n\nIt would be cool if something similar to `projectcalico.org/orchestrator` exists that lets us specify the resource type we want to select. \n\n## Current Behavior\n<!--- If describing a bug, tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->\n<!--- If suggesting a change/improvement, explain the difference from current behavior -->\n\nWe can use `global()` to select across all global resources, but cannot limit this to just GlobalNetworkSets. We can use an external policy agent, like OPA or kyverno, to disallow setting our networkset labels on resources that are not network sets but this requires an additional system to be deployed.\n\n## Possible Solution\n<!--- Not obligatory, but suggest a fix/reason for the bug, -->\n<!--- or ideas how to implement the addition or change -->\n\nCalico could automatically add a new label, e.g. `projectcalico.org/kind` to each calico resource so that we can select resources by kind and their labels within the same selector. In our case, we could write a selector like `networking.our.internal.stuff/networkset == \"some-name\" && projectcalico.org/kind == \"GlobalNetworkSet\"`\n\nAnother solution would be something like a `kind(GlobalNetworkSet)` expression that does the same, but does not require an extra label.\n\n## Context\n<!--- How has this issue affected you? What are you trying to accomplish? -->\n<!--- Providing context helps us come up with a solution that is most useful in the real world -->\n\nWe want to be as strict as possible in our network policies and close any potential loophole that might exist in our setup.\n",

Their labels are not. It is possible to add the same label to two different network sets potentially allowing much more than expected. Something like `kind(GlobalNetworkSet) && name(Something)` as an expression would perfectly express what we want without allowing any potential misconfiguration.\n\nAgain, we can work around this using additional tooling (VAP/OPA/Kyverno) that verifies that the value of our `networking.our.internal.stuff/networkset` label exactly matches the name of a global network set, but built-in support for more precision when declaring network policies would be really nice!", "Hey guys,\n\nI'd love to try and work on this one. Do you have a general advice where I should start with this?", "Thanks @ivnhk ! \n\nI'd start by familiarizing yourself with how to build and run Calico and its tests. There's a general contribution guide here: https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md (although I'll admit, it might be a tad out of date...)\n\nYou might also want to poke around to see how the (very similar) `orchestrator` label is handled for kubernetes pods. Here's a hint: https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/blob/f3da524b7c6e4cfdf9874b2cddd0233213a1d8f3/libcalico-go/lib/backend/k8s/conversion/workload_endpoint_default.go#L163\n\nWe convert pods into an internal type called \"WorkloadEndpoint\" and when we do, we force a label to be set on it for selection. \n\nFor NetworkSets, you could probably do something similar - or even better since it's an API that we control, you could also add it to the defaulting and validation code for that API - here are some hints on that part:\n\n- https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/blob/master/libcalico-go/lib/clientv3/networkset.go\n- https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/blob/f3da524b7c6e4cfdf9874b2cddd0233213a1d8f3/libcalico-go/lib/validator/v3/validator.go#L269-L270 " ],

      "description" : "## Bug Report\n\nPlease answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\n\n### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)\n\n1.  Open https://www.kcl-lang.io/ on a mobile device (or resize your browser window to a mobile viewport width).\n2.  Scroll down to the \"Subscribe to Newsletter\" section.\n\n### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)\n\nThe email input field and the \"SUBSCRIBE\" button should ideally be horizontally aligned, or at least optimized for a tidier and more integrated appearance on mobile screens.\n\n### 3. What did you see instead (Required)\n\nThe email input field and the \"SUBSCRIBE\" button are currently displayed vertically (one above the other), resulting in an untidy and less integrated appearance on mobile devices.\n\n**Screenshots:**\n**Current Mobile Layout:**\n<img width=\"120\" alt=\"Mobile - before\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0a8aba4-28e1-4d38-81b5-b3877e3c110a\" />\n*Description:* Shows the input field and button stacked vertically.\n\n### 4. What is your KCL components version? (Required)\n\nN/A. This issue pertains to the User Interface (UI) of the `kcl-lang.io` website on mobile, not to a KCL component or runtime.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Information\n\nI have a local fix that adjusts the CSS/layout of the subscribe form to align the email input field and the \"SUBSCRIBE\" button horizontally on mobile viewports. This change significantly improves the form's appearance and responsiveness.\n\n**Screenshot of Proposed Layout (Local Fix Example):**\n<img width=\"120\" alt=\"Mobile - after\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab312215-2880-4d00-9fb8-16e539437abd\" />\n*Description:* Shows the input field and button horizontally aligned, demonstrating a cleaner look.\n\nI am ready to open a Pull Request (PR) with the proposed changes if this improvement is a good fit for the project. Please let me know if you would like me to proceed with a PR.\n\nThank you for your consideration.",

      "description" : "## Background\nThe PID class is a base implementation for lots of controllers. Therefore, we should thrive for full test coverage\n\nHaving a look at the [coverage report](https://app.codecov.io/gh/ros-controls/control_toolbox/tree/ros2-master/control_toolbox), we see that some methods have no coverage, e.g., \n\n- `void PidROS::reset()`\n- `void PidROS::reset(bool save_i_term)`\n- `double PidROS::compute_command(double error, double error_dot, const rclcpp::Duration & dt)`\n- `void PidROS::set_current_cmd(double cmd) { pid_.set_current_cmd(cmd); }`\n- `double PidROS::get_current_cmd() { return pid_.get_current_cmd(); }`\n- `void PidROS::print_values()`\n\nand in general, we have little coverage in testing the input validations.\n\nImprove that by additional tests/test-cases.\n\n## Instructions\nHi, this is a `good-first-issue` issue. This means we've worked to make it more legible to people who either **haven't contributed to our codebase before, or even folks who haven't contributed to open source before**.\n\nWe're interested in helping you take the first step, and can answer questions and help you out along the way. Note that we're especially interested in contributions from underrepresented groups!\n\nWe know that creating a pull request is the biggest barrier for new contributors. This issue is for you \uD83D\uDC9D\n\nIf you have contributed before, **consider leaving this PR for someone new**, and looking through our general [bug](https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_control/labels/bug) issues. Thanks!\n\n### \uD83E\uDD14 What you will need to know.\n\nNothing. This issue is meant to welcome you to Open Source :) We are happy to walk you through the process.\n\n### \uD83D\uDCCB Step by Step\n\n- [ ] \uD83D\uDE4B **Claim this issue**: Comment below. If someone else has claimed it, ask if they've opened a pull request already and if they're stuck -- maybe you can help them solve a problem or move it along!\n\n- [ ] \uD83D\uDDC4️ **Create a local workspace** for making your changes and testing [following these instructions](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Tutorials/Workspace/Creating-A-Workspace.html), for Step 3 use \"Download Source Code\" section with [these instructions](https://control.ros.org/master/doc/getting_started/getting_started.html#building-from-source).\n\n- [ ] \uD83C\uDF74 **Fork the repository** using the handy button at the top of the repository page and **clone** it into `~/ws_ros2_control/src/ros-controls/ros2_control`, [here is a guide that you can follow](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) (You will have to remove or empty the existing `ros2_control` folder before cloning your own fork)\n\n- [ ] **Checkout a new branch** using `git checkout -b <branch_name>`\n\n- [ ] \uD83E\uDD16 **Apply `pre-commit`** auto formatting, by running `pip3 install pre-commit` and running `pre-commit install` in the ros2_control repo.\n\n- [ ] \uD83D\uDCBE **Commit and Push** your changes\n\n- [ ] \uD83D\uDD00 **Start a Pull Request** to request to merge your code into `master`. There are two ways that you can start a pull request:\n1. If you are not familiar with GitHub or how to create a pull request, [here is a guide you can follow](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) on how GitHub works.\n\n- [ ] \uD83C\uDFC1 **Done** Ask in comments for a review :)\n\n### Is someone else already working on this?\n\n\uD83D\uDD17- We encourage contributors to link to the original issue in their pull request so all users can easily see if someone's already started on it.\n\n\uD83D\uDC65- **If someone seems stuck, offer them some help!**\n\n### \uD83E\uDD14❓ Questions?\n\nDon’t hesitate to ask questions or to get help if you feel like you are getting stuck. For example leave a comment below!\nFurthermore, you find helpful resources here:\n* [ROS2 Control Contribution Guide](https://control.ros.org/master/doc/contributing/contributing.html)\n* [ROS2 Tutorials](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Tutorials.html)\n* [Robotics Stack Exchange](https://robotics.stackexchange.com)\n\n**Good luck with your first issue!**\n",

That would take you to major.minor release section of the download page. That would require those sections' URLs to be long-term stable URLs. If not, alternative URLs are needed.\r\n\r\n@kythant @gabbybilka @MikeHillberg are those URLs long-term stable? If not is there a long-term stable alternative? If not could we make that?", "This issue can be reproduced using unpackaged sample apps from the [WindowsAppSDK-Samples](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK-Samples/tree/release/experimental/Samples/Unpackaged) repository.\n\uD83D\uDEE0️ Resolution Guidance\nThe error dialog currently directs users to the latest Windows App SDK downloads page, rather than the specific version required by the application, which can lead to confusion—especially when older versions are hosted separately.\n✅ Expected Behavior\nEnsure the error dialog redirects users to atleast the correct major/minor version of the required installer.\n\uD83D\uDD17 Linking Strategy\n\t• Collaborate with the Docs team to determine whether redirection links can be hosted entirely on the docs site. For example, link to version 1.7 could initially point to the main downloads page and later redirect to the archive page. Or, whether we need to create stable links for each version\n\uD83E\uDDE9 Code Changes\n\t• Confirm that the correct major and minor version numbers are accessible—or can be made accessible—in code at the point where the error dialog is invoked (see [Initialize_OnError_ShowUI](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK/blob/5ce1f09f8ed314dd647c12be1d910ef894645168/dev/Deployment/DeploymentManager.cpp#L661) and [MddBootstrapInitialize_ShowUI_OnNoMatch](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK/blob/5ce1f09f8ed314dd647c12be1d910ef894645168/dev/WindowsAppRuntime_BootstrapDLL/MddBootstrap.cpp#L1153))\n\t• Construct a version-specific URL using the major and minor version numbers and pass it to the ShellExecute call.\n\uD83D\uDD2E Future-Proofing\n\t• Consider fallback behavior if a version-specific link is unavailable (low priority)." ],

name\n\nlint/correctness/noUnusedImports\n\n### Playground link\n\nhttps://biomejs.dev/playground/?code=aQBtAHAAbwByAHQAIAB0AHkAcABlACAAewB9ACAAZgByAG8AbQAgACcAQABtAHUAaQAvAHgALQBkAGEAdABhAC0AZwByAGkAZAAvAHQAaABlAG0AZQBBAHUAZwBtAGUAbgB0AGEAdABpAG8AbgAnADsA\n\n### Expected result\n\nFor certain libraries like MUI, we have imports purely for type augmentation like this:\n\n```ts\nimport type {} from '@mui/lab/themeAugmentation';\n```\n\nWe use `import type {}` so that it will only utilize the type information and nothing else during bundling.\n\nIn Biome v1 there was no error, but Biome v2 triggers an error for `lint/correctness/noUnusedImports` and the fixer actually removes the statement which causes other issues. \n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow Biome's Code of Conduct",

Schema Refactor (Supabase)\n- Identify all instances of `owner_id` across the Supabase schema (tables, relationships, foreign keys).\n- Rename the columns to `kinder_id`, preserving existing constraints.\n- Create a properly versioned SQL migration file using Supabase CLI and place it under `services/supabase/migrations/`.\n- Validate database consistency after the rename through Supabase CLI and dashboard tools.\n\n### 2. Backend Adjustments (`services/supabase`)\n- Refactor all code references to `owner_id` across query logic, types, and service utilities.\n- Ensure all affected endpoints and mutations behave as expected with the updated schema.\n\n### 3. Frontend Integration (`apps/web`)\n- Update Supabase queries, types, and hooks that reference `owner_id`.\n- Refactor relevant components or forms handling project ownership or user metadata.\n- Run and update any impacted unit tests or mocks accordingly.\n\n### 4. Documentation\n- Update schema diagrams, ERD references, and technical documentation under `docs/` to reflect the updated field naming and align with project terminology.\n\n###  Deliverables\n- Fully working PR with schema + code changes.\n- A Supabase CLI-compatible SQL migration script.\n- Clear changelog and commit breakdown.\n- Optional: Schema diff or notes for internal dev reference.\n\n**ETA:** I estimate 36–48 hours for full implementation, testing, and documentation updates.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to take it! \nHappy to help standardize and improve the DB structure.\n", "# Hi there, @4c1d-V \uD83D\uDC4B You've been assigned this issue.\n\nOne invite is waiting for you in your email.

Please describe\n\nCurrently, optimized histogram aggregation using multi range traversal initialized `Ranges` with all buckets eagerly. While for individual request, memory implications are small, it can starting adding up across all requests on a node.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nGiven we process buckets one at a time, they can be initialized lazily avoiding unnecessary memory allocations. This should also allow to raise the number of buckets limit from 3k to 10k or more \n\n### Related component\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

It is clear that many contributors are not reading the contributing.MD or the documentation update readme. \n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nWe are a welcoming community and we would like to include all regardless of their learning methodology. Some read, others watch. So, we would like a video to welcome contributors and walk them through the basics of contributing to KubeStellar. Once completed, we can create a shortcut url and give it to anyone with a question about making a contribution. This saves everyone time.\n\n### Are you willing to contribute?\n\n- [ ] Yes, I'd like to help implement this feature.\n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_",

For Windows users, you need to install `sudo` to execute commands with elevated privileges. Here are the steps to install `sudo` on Windows:\n\n### Installing `sudo` on Windows\n\n1. **Using Chocolatey:**\n   - If you don't have Chocolatey installed, you can install it by following the instructions on the [Chocolatey website](https://chocolatey.org/install).\n   - Once Chocolatey is installed, open a command prompt as an administrator and run:\n     ```bash\n     choco install gsudo\n     ```\n\n2. **Using Scoop:**\n   - If you don't have Scoop installed, you can install it by following the instructions on the [Scoop website](https://scoop.sh/).\n   - Once Scoop is installed, open a command prompt as an administrator and run:\n     ```bash\n     scoop install gsudo\n     ```\n\n3. **Using WinGet:**\n   - If you don't have WinGet installed, you can install it by following the instructions on the [WinGet website](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli).\n   - Once WinGet is installed, open a command prompt as an administrator and run:\n     ```bash\n     winget install gerardog.gsudo\n     ```\n\n## Installation Instructions for KubeFlex\n\n1. **Download the KubeFlex CLI:**\n   - Download the latest KubeFlex CLI binary release for your OS/Architecture from the [release page](https://github.com/kubestellar/kubeflex/releases) and copy it to `/usr/local/bin` or another location in your `$PATH`.\n\n   For example, on Linux amd64:\n   ```bash\n   OS_ARCH=linux_amd64\n   LATEST_RELEASE_URL=\\$(curl -H \"Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json\" https://api.github.com/repos/kubestellar/kubeflex/releases/latest | jq -r '.assets[] | select(.name | contains(\"linux_amd64\")) | .browser_download_url')\n   sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 <(curl -L \\$LATEST_RELEASE_URL) /usr/local/bin/kfle\n\n\n2.**Alternative Installation Command:**\nYou can also use the following command, which will automatically detect the host OS type and architecture:\n\n```\nsudo bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubestellar/kubeflex/main/scripts/install-kubeflex.sh) --ensure-folder /usr/local/bin\n\n```\n", "@Krishna-mishra-26 ty for your help here.

This means that, when executing the `createapp` command, new projects generated with this command use ESLint.\r\n\r\nBut the framework monorepo itself has not yet been migrated to ESLint. This is a technical debt that should be resolved.\r\n\r\n# Guidelines\r\n\r\n- ~If [this PR](https://github.com/FoalTS/foal/pull/1260), which updates the way dependencies are managed in monorepo, has not yet been merged, the new branch should be created from `v4-5-0`. Otherwise, it should be created from `master`. Not only will this facilitate the migration to ESLint, it will also avoid the need for additional work later on to manage ESLint dependencies with the new dependency system.~\r\n- Migration to ESLint should not change the style of the framework code (we don't want thousands of line changes to commit). A lot of work had been done at the time in [this PR](https://github.com/FoalTS/foal/pull/561) to make ESLint rules consistent with TSLint rules. There's probably a lot to be learned from this PR.\r\n- When opening the framework repository with VSCode with the ESLint plugin enabled, VSCode should correctly highlight ESLint errors and correct them when saving (if the plugin is configurer to do so).\r\n\r\n# Notes\r\n\r\n- There *might* be useful information [here](https://typescript-eslint.io/getting-started/typed-linting/monorepos/).\r\n- The files `packages/cli/src/generate/specs/app/.eslintrc.js` and `packages/cli/src/generate/templates/app/.eslintrc.js` used by `foal createapp` to generate new projects may cause problems.",

I'll let you choose what you think is the best solution.\n\nThe ideal solution where we want to go is this:\n- the method used in the monorepo framework should be the same as that used in new projects generated by `foal createapp`,\n- and the linting rules used in the monorepo framework should be the same as those used in new projects generated by `foal createapp`.\n\nIn this way, when we write documentation and copy-paste code from the framework, the examples are always correctly “linted” when users then copy-paste the same code into their projects.\n\n**Note 1:** if we have this ideal solution with the same rules and the `createapp` rules are still the same and there are linting errors that appear from the framework code, then we can fix them all. Go for it \uD83D\uDC4D \n\n**Note 2:** in tests of the directory `acceptance-tests/`, there are pieces of code that are between comments such as `======== DOCUMENTATION BEGIN =======` and `====== DOCUMENTATION END =======`. In this case, this means that these codes are present in the documentation and should be updated as well in the markdowns in case of modification. You can ignore files in `docs/versioned_docs/` and `docs/i18n/`.\n\nThank you so much, for taking care of this.

It would be useful to provide some type of automation around identifying:\n\n1. what en.yml strings do not have a corresponding localization for zh-CN.yml (what keys in en.yml do not exist in zh-CN.yml)\n1. what keys in zh-CN.yml do not exist in en.yml - these would be old keys in zh-CN.yml that may need removed, or they are misspelled keys\n1. if an en.yml string gets updated/modified, to flag which strings in zh-CN.yml need updated (this requires a clever git blame to determine the line number in the YAML file where a key starts and ensure the commit date of zh-CN.yml for a given key is greater than the commit date for the same key in en.yml. if en.yml is later that indicates that for this key the translation has been updated or modified and may need to be updated or modified for zh-CN. NOTE: a problem with this is if there is a false positive... like we fix a typo in the English or word it better but the Chinese is good and needs no update.. we could figure that out later). Could use https://www.rubydoc.info/github/libgit2/rugged/Rugged/Blame for this\n1. what strings in the application have not be internationalized (these strings are hardcoded)\n\nThere are many tools and approaches for this, but we want to keep deployment simple. The yaml files mean the translations stay with the code which is nice. Could probably use `for_line`. This also might encourage us to avoid multi-line strings in the locale files.\n\nMaybe a rake task is sufficient to start.\n\nAlso worth searching for existing tools that might assist with this as an alternative to writing our own.\n\n┆Issue is synchronized with this [Asana task](https://app.asana.com/0/1202821104799596/1204178484951391) by [Unito](https://www.unito.io)\n",

There are also tools like https://github.com/pejuko/i18n-translators-tools to convert the default Rails yaml into other formats for easier translation. We could also consider future versions of OnDemand using gettext. gettext doesn't use keys like the Rails yaml does, and just takes the full sentence and provides a translation for it. Most TMS support this out of the box, though there may also be examples of TMS projects that work with the Rails yaml formats. Another benefit of the gettext PO format is that its language/framework independent so if at some point we drop Rails or still have a mixture of Rails and other language/framework for apps in OnDemand, or want to translate error strings in Apache and/or NGINX as well, we can handle all of that in an language independent way.\r\n\r\nExamples: http://pootle.translatehouse.org/, http://zanata.org/ (RedHat product with free open source project support)\r\n\r\nSearch for \"open source translation management systems\" to see many options.", "Still thinking about this.

      "url" : "https://github.com/onnx/onnx/issues/7100",
      "repositoryName" : "onnx/onnx",
      "description" : "### System information\n\nTop of tree.\n\n### What is the problem that this feature solves?\n\nCurrently, ONNX’s `shape_inference.infer_shapes` API performs both type and shape inference simultaneously. Type inference is guaranteed in a valid model, but shape inference is on \"best effort\" basis. For some operators (e.g., GridSample, Gather, Reshape, Where, etc), shape inference may fail due to incomplete or complex shape logic, even when type inference could succeed. \nThis tight coupling prevents users from recovering type information when shape inference is unsupported or fails. For example, when users attempt to inject cast nodes or quantize nodes and propagate the type information downstream.\n\n\n**Request:**\nPlease consider adding an option to ONNX’s shape inference API to:\n- Run type inference independently of shape inference, so that type information can be propagated even when shape inference fails or is not implemented for an operator.\n- Alternatively, relax the requirement that shape inference must succeed for type inference to run.\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Enables users and downstream tools to recover and validate type information in more models, improving robustness and usability.\n- Reduces manual workarounds (such as manually setting types for affected nodes).\n- Makes ONNX models more portable and easier to analyze, even when shape logic is incomplete.\n\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n1. Create a separate function to support only type inference `infer_types` (preferable) \n2. Add boolean argument `check_shape=True` to the existing `infer_shapes` API (renaming the function is advisable in this case, `infer_shapes_and_types` or similar).\n\n\n### Describe the feature\n\nDecouple type inference from shape inference.\n\n\n### Will this influence the current api (Y/N)?\n\nDepends on the alternative selected. \nCan maintain backwards compatiblity.\n\n### Feature Area\n\nshape_inference\n\n### Are you willing to contribute it (Y/N)\n\nNone\n\n### Notes\n\nRelated issues https://github.com/onnx/onnx/issues/4934",

      "url" : "https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy/issues/9094",
      "repositoryName" : "aquasecurity/trivy",
      "description" : "## Description\n\nThis is a feature request to add SHA-512 hash algorithm support to Trivy's SBOM parsing capabilities. Currently, Trivy only supports SHA-1, SHA-256, and MD5 hash algorithms when processing SBOM files.\n\nSome tools, particularly NPM's SBOM generation (`npm sbom`), use SHA-512 hashes for package integrity verification. Adding SHA-512 support would enable Trivy to fully process these SBOMs and preserve important security metadata.\n\n### Current limitations:\n- **CycloneDX**: SHA-512 hashes are ignored and the hashes field becomes `null`\n- **SPDX**: SHA-512 checksums are completely omitted from the output\n\n\n## Current Behavior\n\n### CycloneDX\nIn `pkg/sbom/cyclonedx/unmarshal.go:251-268`, the `unmarshalHashes` function only supports:\n- SHA1\n- SHA256\n- MD5\n\nAny other algorithm (including SHA-512) logs a warning but still creates a digest with an empty algorithm prefix (e.g., `:hashvalue` instead of `sha512:hashvalue`), resulting in malformed digest strings.\n\n### SPDX\nIn `pkg/sbom/spdx/marshal.go:501-522`, the `spdxChecksums` function has the same limitation, returning `nil` for unsupported algorithms.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe limitation stems from `pkg/digest/digest.go` which only defines three algorithms:\n```go\nconst (\n    SHA1   Algorithm = \"sha1\"\n    SHA256 Algorithm = \"sha256\"\n    MD5    Algorithm = \"md5\"\n)\n```\n\n## Desired Behavior\n\nTrivy should support SHA-512 hash algorithm alongside the existing SHA-1, SHA-256, and MD5 support. This would enable Trivy to:\n- Preserve SHA-512 hashes when processing SBOMs from NPM and other tools\n- Generate SBOMs with SHA-512 hashes when appropriate\n- Maintain full compatibility with CycloneDX and SPDX specifications\n\n\n## Impact\n\n- Loss of package integrity verification data\n- Generated SBOMs may be invalid or incomplete\n- Affects tools that rely on SHA-512 for security validation\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n1. Add SHA512 constant to `pkg/digest/digest.go`:\n   ```go\n   const (\n       SHA1   Algorithm = \"sha1\"\n       SHA256 Algorithm = \"sha256\"\n       SHA512 Algorithm = \"sha512\"\n       MD5    Algorithm = \"md5\"\n   )\n   ```\n\n2. Add SHA-512 calculation support in the digest package\n\n3. Update `unmarshalHashes` in CycloneDX:\n   ```go\n   case cdx.HashAlgoSHA512:\n       alg = digest.SHA512\n   ```\n\n4. Update `spdxChecksums` in SPDX:\n   ```go\n   case digest.SHA512:\n       alg = spdx.SHA512\n   ```\n\n## References\n\n- NPM SBOM documentation: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npm-sbom\n- CycloneDX hash algorithm specification: https://cyclonedx.org/docs/1.6/json/#components_items_hashes\n- SPDX checksum specification: https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/package-information/#79-package-checksum-field\n\n## Test Data\n\n### CycloneDX Example\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"http://cyclonedx.org/schema/bom-1.5.schema.json\",\n  \"bomFormat\": \"CycloneDX\",\n  \"specVersion\": \"1.5\",\n  \"components\": [\n    {\n      \"bom-ref\": \"lodash@4.17.21\",\n      \"type\": \"library\",\n      \"name\": \"lodash\",\n      \"version\": \"4.17.21\",\n      \"hashes\": [\n        {\n          \"alg\": \"SHA-512\",\n          \"content\": \"bf690311ee7b95e713ba568322e3533f2dd1cb880b189e99d4edef13592b81764daec43e2c54c61d5c558dc5cfb35ecb85b65519e74026ff17675b6f8f916f4a\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### SPDX Example\n```json\n{\n  \"spdxVersion\": \"SPDX-2.3\",\n  \"packages\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"lodash\",\n      \"SPDXID\": \"SPDXRef-Package-lodash-4.17.21\",\n      \"checksums\": [\n        {\n          \"algorithm\": \"SHA512\",\n          \"checksumValue\": \"bf690311ee7b95e713ba568322e3533f2dd1cb880b189e99d4edef13592b81764daec43e2c54c61d5c558dc5cfb35ecb85b65519e74026ff17675b6f8f916f4a\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Discussed in https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy/discussions/9082\n",

      "description" : "**Describe the bug**\nWhen a list entry contains only a link, the three-dot menu button to switch between text and preview is displayed left to it. The alignment is off and overlaps the menu bullet point:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab7f5c4a-9482-470a-870e-e2ce138bbfa3)\n\nBut probably we should not show the menu at all in lists, as switching a link to preview breaks the entire list.\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n1. Add a standalone text link inside a link item\n2. See the broken alignment of the three-dot menu button\n3. Opne three-dot menu and select 'preview'\n4. See broken list\n\n**Expected behavior**\nEither disable the menu to switch between text and preview link inside lists, or fix both showing previews in lists and alignment of the button in lists.\n\n**Server details:**\n- Nextcloud version: 29\n",

Python typing has no notion of \"undefined\", so\n        #   this cannot be reflected in the type.\n        # - Technically `param` is only (possibly) defined on SubRequest, not\n        #   FixtureRequest, but the typing of that is still in flux so this cheats.\n        # - In the future we might consider using a generic for the param type, but\n        #   for now just using Any.\n        self.param: Any\n\n    ...\n```\n\nBoth `mypy` and `pyright` do not emit an error for this (`mypy` does complain about the return annotation being a `str` and `request.param` returning `Any` in strict mode, though).\n\nI guess that attributes assigned in `__init__` methods are currently not considered or that there is at least no proper resolution to which `__init__` gets called (since this is an ABC)? The comment above `self.param` may also be relevant here.\n\n### Version\n\nty 0.0.1-alpha.11",

Instead of only considering bindings for attribute assignments, we need to consider both bindings and declarations. Declarations are already correctly recorded in the semantic index, but in type inference, we currently only access the bindings. The patch below may be useful as a reference to see which places in the source code need to change. It switches everything from bindings-only to declarations-only (which would fix the issue here), but of course that needs to be extended to consider both.\n\nJust like when resolving references to normal variables, declarations should take precedence over bindings. That is, even if we see conflicting definitions such as `self.x: int` and `self.x = \"a string\"`, the type of the `x` attribute should just be `int`.\n\n<details>\n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/semantic_index.rs b/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/semantic_index.rs\nindex d4f848e69d..9be2b157d7 100644\n--- a/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/semantic_index.rs\n+++ b/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/semantic_index.rs\n@@ -108,7 +108,7 @@ pub(crate) fn attribute_assignments<'db, 's>(\n     db: &'db dyn Db,\n     class_body_scope: ScopeId<'db>,\n     name: &'s str,\n-) -> impl Iterator<Item = (BindingWithConstraintsIterator<'db, 'db>, FileScopeId)> + use<'s, 'db> {\n+) -> impl Iterator<Item = (DeclarationsIterator<'db, 'db>, FileScopeId)> + use<'s, 'db> {\n     let file = class_body_scope.file(db);\n     let index = semantic_index(db, file);\n \n@@ -116,7 +116,7 @@ pub(crate) fn attribute_assignments<'db, 's>(\n         let place_table = index.place_table(function_scope_id);\n         let place = place_table.place_id_by_instance_attribute_name(name)?;\n         let use_def = &index.use_def_maps[function_scope_id];\n-        Some((use_def.public_bindings(place), function_scope_id))\n+        Some((use_def.public_declarations(place), function_scope_id))\n     })\n }\n \ndiff --git a/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/semantic_index/use_def.rs b/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/semantic_index/use_def.rs\nindex 8ac7f91811..978ce2de7a 100644\n--- a/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/semantic_index/use_def.rs\n+++ b/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/semantic_index/use_def.rs\n@@ -463,10 +463,10 @@ impl<'db> UseDefMap<'db> {\n             .is_always_false()\n     }\n \n-    pub(crate) fn is_binding_reachable(\n+    pub(crate) fn is_declaration_reachable(\n         &self,\n         db: &dyn crate::Db,\n-        binding: &BindingWithConstraints<'_, 'db>,\n+        binding: &DeclarationWithConstraint<'db>,\n     ) -> Truthiness {\n         self.reachability_constraints.evaluate(\n             db,\ndiff --git a/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/types/class.rs b/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/types/class.rs\nindex 3cd7bffa5b..371291a94a 100644\n--- a/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/types/class.rs\n+++ b/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/types/class.rs\n@@ -1744,10 +1744,10 @@ impl<'db> ClassLiteral<'db> {\n                     let method = index.expect_single_definition(method_def);\n                     let method_place = class_table.place_id_by_name(&method_def.name).unwrap();\n                     class_map\n-                        .public_bindings(method_place)\n-                        .find_map(|bind| {\n-                            (bind.binding.is_defined_and(|def| def == method))\n-                                .then(|| class_map.is_binding_reachable(db, &bind))\n+                        .public_declarations(method_place)\n+                        .find_map(|decl| {\n+                            (decl.declaration.is_defined_and(|def| def == method))\n+                                .then(|| class_map.is_declaration_reachable(db, &decl))\n                         })\n                         .unwrap_or(Truthiness::AlwaysFalse)\n                 } else {\n@@ -1762,7 +1762,7 @@ impl<'db> ClassLiteral<'db> {\n             let mut unbound_binding = None;\n \n             for attribute_assignment in attribute_assignments {\n-                if let DefinitionState::Undefined = attribute_assignment.binding {\n+                if let DefinitionState::Undefined = attribute_assignment.declaration {\n                     // Store the implicit unbound binding here so that we can delay the\n                     // computation of `unbound_reachability` to the point when we actually\n                     // need it.

These buttons should allow users to share the post on popular platforms such as:\n\n    Twitter\n    LinkedIn\n\nEach button should generate a pre-filled sharing link, including the blog post title, URL, and possibly hashtags. For example:\n\n```Twitter: https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Check+out+this+blog!&url=https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/2024-annual-summary#social-media```\n\nThe buttons should be visually appealing, lightweight, and non-intrusive. They can be displayed at the top or bottom of each blog post.\n\n### \uD83D\uDEA7 Breaking changes\n\nYes\n\n### \uD83D\uDC40 Have you checked for similar open issues?\n\n- [x] I checked and didn't find a similar issue\n\n### \uD83C\uDFE2 Have you read the Contributing Guidelines?\n\n- [x] I have read the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/asyncapi/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n### Are you willing to work on this issue?\n\nYes I am willing to submit a PR!",

      "description" : "Part of #12048\n\n## Issue\nAfter most of the Unit Test migration in #12048, there are a lot of inconsistencies in access control test methods. This is because we did not migrate the many convenient, abstracted, and commonly used access control test methods from `ui/webapi/BaseActionTest.java` to `sqlui/webapi/BaseActionTest.java`.\n\nAfter merging #13254, all of the access control test methods in `BaseActionTest.java` have been migrated. Hence, this issue aims to refactor the unit test access controls to use these convenient test methods.\n\n## Progress\nThe progress for this refactoring can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IcB-viJMrIOknYoBYasBuRBK9qnwY0-doEK4_Eb24IA/edit?gid=0#gid=0). I (the author) will update it when completed PRs are merged proactively.\n\n## Steps to Contribute\n\n1. Choose test(s) to work on in the above Google Sheets link\n2. Check that no on else have claimed the test cases to work on within the last 2 weeks, or that it has been completed by follow up PRs (but not updated in the sheets)\n3. Comment on this issue to indicate that you'd like to contribute on the chosen test(s). Update your comment if you need more than 2 weeks so that other contributors don't overlap with your work.\n4. Create a PR to refactor the unit test(s).\n5. Submit the PR, with a link to this issue by starting the description with \"Part of #13304\"## Tips\n\n- Understand the access control test methods in `sqlui/webapi/BaseActionTest.java`, follow the refactoring in #13254\n- Most of the access control testing logic in the migrated unit tests under `sqlui/webapi` follows the old unit tests under `ui/webapi`, so you may wish to reference the old unit test for help",

The following sections will be managed by moderators only._\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n\n* When module settings are being saved, after CTA has been clicked and CTA enters in progress state, only spinner icon should be showing, text shouldn't be changing to the `Saving` and ellipsis should not show `...`\n\n## Implementation Brief\n\n* [ ] Update `assets/js/components/settings/SettingsActiveModule/FooterPrimaryAction.js`\n  * Remove https://github.com/google/site-kit-wp/blob/4946f1a5df79dfac2ac8f94c6a03283a163241a1/assets/js/components/settings/SettingsActiveModule/FooterPrimaryAction.js#L75 and conditional wrapper around it.\n  * Spinner is already integrated, so no further change is needed\n\n### Test Coverage\n\n* No updates expected\n\n## QA Brief\n\n* <!-- One or more bullet points for how to test that the feature works as expected. -->\n\n## Changelog entry\n\n* <!-- One sentence summarizing the PR, to be used in the changelog. -->\n",

Please describe.**\n\n- osm-fieldwork was developed before pyodk.\n- PyODK - as the official Python ODK - has much of the functionality we need.\n- We still require much from OdkCentralAsync though, as we have some methods that don't exist in PyODK, plus PyODK has no async capability.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\n- Many of our helper functions to get OdkProject, OdkForm, etc, can be replaced with\n```python\nfrom pyodk._utils.config import CentralConfig\nfrom pyodk.client import Client\n\nasync def get_odk_client(odk_central: central_schemas.ODKCentralDecrypted):\n    \"\"\"Helper function to get the OdkForm with credentials.\"\"\"\n    pyodk_config = CentralConfig(\n        base_url=odk_central.odk_central_url,\n        username=odk_central.odk_central_user,\n        password=odk_central.odk_central_password,\n    )\n    with Client(pyodk_config) as client:\n        yield client\n```\n\n- Check if we need to wrap the functionality in error handling, or if this is handled by PyODK (I believe it's probably handled by PyODK automatically.\n- Replace all project / form / appuser updates with this functionality.\n- Keep entity list (dataset), entity, and bulk submission downloads as async via osm_fieldwork.OdkCentralAsync (perhaps rename this though)\n\n**Additional context**\n\n- After doing this we can significantly simplify the osm-fieldwork classes - to the bare minimum additional functionality.\n- We don't need an unasync approach, as sync code should be contributed to pyodk, and async code kept in osm-fieldwork.",

      "description" : "### Steps to reproduce\n\nUse the code below or try dartpad:\n[https://dartpad.dev/?id=06c010125e651e2bfadeecbff2db181a](https://dartpad.dev/?id=06c010125e651e2bfadeecbff2db181a)\nI tested it on the main branch and on the stable one.\n\n### Expected results\n\n`PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber` should return actual frame number on the Web, just like on other platforms.\n\n### Actual results\n\nOn the web `PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber` returns always -1.\nI have tested the code below on the desktop (Windows) and it returns the correct ascending frame numbers. But on the web (via `flutter run -d chrome` or dartpad) this method always returns -1.\nI also found two strange behaviors (potential bugs?).\n1. `frameNumber` has the old value until the end of the transientCallbacks phase. If this is not a bug, it should be documented. The picture below shows a different number in different callbacks during a frame. (underlined in blue)\n2.  `scheduleMicrotask` method calls its callback after the frame ends on the web, and not between `onBeginFrame` and `onDrawFrame` as expected (underlined in red). On the desktop (Windows) it works correctly.\n\n### Code sample\n\n<details open><summary>Code sample</summary>\n\n```dart\nimport 'dart:async';\nimport 'dart:ui';\n\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:flutter/scheduler.dart' show SchedulerBinding, Ticker;\n\nvoid main() {\n  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();\n\n  // ignore: invalid_use_of_protected_member\n  SchedulerBinding.instance.ensureFrameCallbacksRegistered();\n\n  final onBeginFrame = PlatformDispatcher.instance.onBeginFrame;\n  final onDrawFrame = PlatformDispatcher.instance.onDrawFrame;\n\n  PlatformDispatcher.instance.onBeginFrame = (Duration elapsed) {\n    print('+' * 30);\n    final frameNumber = PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber;\n    print('frameNumber from onBeginFrame callback: $frameNumber');\n    onBeginFrame!(elapsed);\n    print('___finish onBeginFrame');\n  };\n\n  PlatformDispatcher.instance.onDrawFrame = () {\n    print('___start onDrawFrame');\n    onDrawFrame!();\n    final frameNumber = PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber;\n    print('frameNumber from onDrawFrame callback: $frameNumber');\n    print('-' * 30);\n  };\n\n  runApp(const App());\n}\n\nclass App extends StatelessWidget {\n  const App({super.key});\n\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return const MaterialApp(debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false, home: Home());\n  }\n}\n\nclass Home extends StatefulWidget {\n  const Home({super.key});\n\n  @override\n  State<Home> createState() => _HomeState();\n}\n\nclass _HomeState extends State<Home> with TickerProviderStateMixin {\n  Ticker? ticker;\n\n  @override\n  void initState() {\n    super.initState();\n\n    SchedulerBinding.instance.addPersistentFrameCallback((_) {\n      final frameNumber = PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber;\n      print('frameNumber from the persistent callback: $frameNumber');\n    });\n\n    ticker = createTicker((_) {\n      final frameNumber = PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber;\n      print('frameNumber from the transient callback: $frameNumber');\n      scheduleMicrotask(() {\n        final frameNumber = PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber;\n        print('frameNumber from the microtask callback: $frameNumber');\n      });\n      SchedulerBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback((_) {\n        final frameNumber = PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber;\n        print('frameNumber from the postframe callback: $frameNumber');\n      });\n    })..start();\n\n    Timer(const Duration(seconds: 1), () {\n      ticker?.dispose();\n      ticker = null;\n    });\n  }\n\n  @override\n  void dispose() {\n    ticker?.dispose();\n    super.dispose();\n  }\n\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return const Placeholder();\n  }\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Screenshots or Video\n\n<details open>\n<summary>Screenshots / Video demonstration</summary>\n\nOn the desktop:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abca8f1d-4d88-4d5a-988e-974c58d0052e)\n\nOn the web:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fcfb6c2-ea1e-4c92-b62f-d7a800e01791)\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Logs\n\n\n\n\n### Flutter Doctor output\n\n<details open><summary>Doctor output</summary>\n\n```console\n[√] Flutter (Channel main, 3.33.0-1.0.pre.619, on Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.19045.5965], locale ru-RU)\n[√] Windows Version (Њ ©Єа®б®дв Windows 10 Pro 64-а §ап¤­ п, 22H2, 2009)\n[√] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 34.0.0)\n[√] Chrome - develop for the web\n[√] Visual Studio - develop Windows apps (Visual Studio Build Tools 2022 17.6.5)\n[√] Android Studio (version 2022.2)\n[√] VS Code (version 1.101.1)\n[√] Connected device (4 available)\n[√] Network resources\n\n• No issues found!\n```\n\n</details>\n",

The 0.24 blog post has/will have some instructions on how to do this, so it should be easy for anyone to do. If you want to contribute something relatively small feel free to update one (or more) and make a pull request. A rough list of easy plots/recipes:\n- [ ] arc\n- [ ] band\n- [ ] pie\n- [ ] poly\n- [ ] stairs\n- [ ] stem\n- [ ] tooltip\n- [ ] wireframe\n- [ ] density\n- [ ] qqplot (distributions.jl)\n- [ ] stephist\n- [ ] hist\n- [ ] timeseries\n- [ ] series\n\nSome recipes still use `register_computation!()` when they could use `map!()`. This should be a fairly easy cleanup/replacement as well.\n- [ ] tricontourf\n- [ ] spy\n- [ ] scatterlines\n\nSome recipes may require some more refactoring, like breaking up an `onany` that updates multiple observables. They should still be fairly easy to translate (though I haven't checked in depth). `contourf` or `errorbars` might be an instructive example.\n- [ ] arrows\n- [ ] barplot\n- [ ] contour\n- [ ] triplot\n- [ ] waterfall\n- [ ] boxplot\n- [ ] crossbar\n- [ ] hexbin\n- [ ] violin\n\nSome recipes apply transformations and projections. These should probably be delayed a bit, as we can/should extend what's happening for primitive plots to recipe plots here\n- ~~hlines, vlines, hspan, vspan (+ limit tracking)~~\n- [ ] annotation (+ bbox handling)\n- [ ] bracket\n- [ ] streamplot (or maybe refactor rotation handling?)\n- [ ] textlabel\n- [ ] voronoiplot\n\nOther:\n- [ ] volumeslices (how do we want to handle the transformation system)\n\nNot sure if done:\n- [ ] axis3d (maybe needs full rework?)\n- [ ] datashader\n- [ ] rainclouds",

      "description" : "# GPU Support for the Ersilia Model Hub\n\n## Background\n\nCurrently, the Ersilia Model Hub does not support GPU acceleration, which limits the performance of some models — and makes others completely unusable. Models are currently packaged as CPU-only Docker images. The goal of this project is to evaluate and implement GPU support using Docker.\n\n## Goals\n\n- Demonstrate that a model can run inside a Docker container with GPU access.\n- Build the foundation to support GPU in the Ersilia infrastructure (template, CLI, metadata, CI/CD).\n- Benchmark performance between CPU and GPU runs.\n\n## Step 1: Manual GPU Docker Test (Top-Down)\n\nWe will first verify that models can run in a GPU-enabled Docker container, without relying on Ersilia's internal infrastructure (e.g., CLI or model template).\n\n- [ ] Select two test models:\n  - [ ] One **GPU-only** model (TBD).\n  - [ ] One **GPU/CPU-compatible** model (suggested: FAISS-based).\n- [ ] Set up the new GPU workstation.\n- [ ] Choose and test an appropriate CUDA base image (e.g., `nvidia/cuda:...`).\n- [ ] Ensure image size is acceptable (<~4GB ideally).\n- [ ] Run tests on:\n  - [ ] At least two local GPU workstations.\n  - [ ] One cloud instance (e.g., AWS GPU instance).\n\n## Step 2: Integrate GPU Support into Ersilia Infrastructure\n\n### \uD83E\uDDF1 At the [Ersilia Template](https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos-template) level\n\n- [ ] How should `install.yml` indicate GPU requirements?\n- [ ] If model code differs between CPU/GPU, how should this be reflected in the `framework/`?\n\n### ⚙️ At the [Ersilia CLI](https://github.com/ersilia-os/ersilia) level\n\n- [ ] Add support for `--gpu` or `--cpu` flags in the `ersilia serve` command.\n- [ ] Decide whether GPU/CPU mode should be:\n  - Explicit (user-defined via flag), or\n  - Automatic (detect from hardware?)\n- [ ] Assess: Can one image support both CPU and GPU, or do we need separate ones?\n\n### \uD83D\uDCE6 At the [Ersilia Metadata](https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos5axz/blob/main/metadata.json) level\n\n- [ ] Add `runtime: GPU` / `CPU` or similar field.\n- [ ] Consider `requirements` or `compatibility` sections if needed.\n\n### \uD83D\uDC33 On [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/ersiliaos)\n\n- [ ] Should GPU-compatible images use a separate tag (e.g., `model:gpu`) or separate repo?\n- [ ] Define tagging convention early.\n\n## Step 3: GitHub Actions & CI Integration\n\nIn the [Ersilia Model Workflows](https://github.com/ersilia-os/ersilia-model-workflows):\n\n- [ ] Detect whether a model supports GPU.\n- [ ] Build and push a GPU-compatible Docker image (using `nvidia-docker`).\n- [ ] Ensure existing workflows are not broken.\n\nIn the [Ersilia CLI CI/CD](https://github.com/ersilia-os/ersilia):\n\n- [ ] Add at least one unit test to check GPU execution (on GitHub-hosted runners or self-hosted runner with GPU).\n\n## Step 4: Benchmarking & Validation\n\n- [ ] Run performance benchmarks:\n  - CPU vs GPU execution time.\n  - Memory consumption and constraints.\n- [ ] Record any limitations or environment-specific requirements.",

For example : \n\n```nvidia/cuda:12.9.0-runtime-ubuntu24.04```\n\nThis comes to ~ 2 GB/3 GB depending on the exact CUDA and Ubuntu Version being used. \n\nIdeally run automated tests/builds for different combinations of Ubuntu (or other distributions?) and CUDA  versions. \n\n## CPU vs GPU preliminary testing\n\nA very simple test on TabPFN using a [Sci-Kit Learn Breast Cancer Dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html) showed approximately 3x-4x speed ups when GPU access to the process was enabled, compared to CPU only runs (on the Norrsken GPU Workstation).\n\nMore detailed tests using a [Dataset of approximately 2 Million Compounds](https://github.com/ersilia-os/sars-cov-2-chemspace/blob/main/data/reference_library_inchikeys.csv) showed overwhelming speed-ups with GPU Accelerated similarity searches using [FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss), the difference between search times of GPU and CPU implementations scaled/diverged with the Index size. **It is clearly worth trying to accelerate models using GPU Acceleration.**\n\nWe built indices out of Count Fingerprints of the compounds (converted the SMILES to 2048 Vectors). Cosine Similarity was used as a metric. \n\nFAISS does not support cosine by default, so we use  an `Inner Product` index and perform L2 (Euclidean) Normalisation on the vectors before adding to them to the index (or before searching), which is the equivalent of using Cosine similarity.\n\nTests were ran with index sizes of `10,000`, `100,000`, `500,000` and `1,000,000`. Nearest 100 Neighbours. \n\n### Index size 100,000:\n| Number of Searches | CPU (s) | GPU (s) |\n|--------------------|---------|---------|\n| 100                | 1       | 0.01    |\n| 1,000              | 7.08    | 0.04    |\n| 10,000             | 67.49   | 0.11    |\n| 100,000            | >350    | 1.30    |\n| 500,000            | -       | 5.50    |\n\n### Index size 1,000,000\n\n| Number of Searches | CPU (s) | GPU (s) |\n|--------------------|---------|---------|\n| 100                | 9.42    | 0.02    |\n| 1,000              | 71      | 0.10    |\n| 10,000             | 711     | 1.03    |\n| 100,000            | -       | 10.45   |\n| 500,000            | -       | 52.50   |\n\n\n\n### \n\n<img width=\"765\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e39adae0-7c06-43ba-ba5f-3da89037da02\" />\n\n_NOTE: GPUs are typically higher latency but have higher parallel throughput and memory bandwidth than CPUs. It is best to use batch queries with the CPU or GPU as this amortises the touching of index memory across all of the queries and this is when GPU speed ups are convenient. We will most likely not see any improvements in GPU search times with single queries (if anything it might be slower because of GPU overhead)._\n\n\nThe examples of inference time comparisons and a 3D plot (inference time against index and query sizes), clearly demonstrate **GPUs provide absolutely non-trivial speed ups for the right tasks.**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "# Very Heavy Index (FAISS Flat)\n\nFlat (IP and L2 for example) indices are extremely large (because FAISS only supports Float32 vectors, hence each Fingerprint vector is 32 * 2048 = 65,536 Bits or 4 * 2048=8,192  Bytes), scaling up to millions of vectors means we are dealing with indices that are 10s of GBs.\n\nTried FPSim2 but there are no benefits to GPU accelerating since it does not support batch queries (could be worth looking into CUDA Programming and tuning it to support batch queries, as it supports Sparse Vectors and Tanimoto Search on GPU)\n\n## Promising alternative to Flat FAISS Index: **Approximate Nearest Neighbour (ANN) search**\n\nMost methods for ANN require index training and parameter tuning which makes building the index more complex. We also need to ensure that the training sample is diverse. \n\nPlease note the difference between training and adding to Indices. And index cannot be trained incrementally but can be incrementally added to.\n\nMemory bottlenecks are also an issue so I first train the index and then add vectors to it incrementally in batches. (Although, it is suggested, If possible at all,  add more compute at index build time. (Especially if the index does not change a lot over time))\n\nThe following ANN methods are explored and suggested (compared to ~16 GB with a flat index of around 1.99 million Vectors)\n\n### **_IVFPQ (Inverted File Index with Product Quantisation):_** \n\n#### **_I am yet to do Accuracy tests on IVFPQ but with computational performance (inference time), models seem to enjoy GPU Acceleration speed ups similar to those mentioned above for FAISS Flat indices._**\n\nThis creates very light indices: `~93 MB for an index of around 1.99 Million Vectors`, but there might be a non-trivial loss of accuracy. \n\nNote: For some reason after the index is trained and incrementally built, FAISS takes a lot of time to write it to disk which makes it look like the process is frozen but isn't actually frozen - it goes into an \"uninterruptible sleep\" because of Disk IO, as indicated by the \"D\" state in htop. \n\n### **_HNSWSQ (Hierarchical Navigable Small World Index with Scalar Quantisation)_**\n\nTraining is reasonably fast (with GPU) but adding vectors is computationally intensive and needs to batched appropriately.\n\n#### **_I am yet to do Accuracy tests on HNSWSQ but with computational performance , HNSW seem to enjoy GPU Acceleration only with at Training time as indices are pretty compact and are VERY FAST with CPU and FAISS does not have a GPU search for this yet._**\n\nWhen choosing the strength of quantisation, there is a trade off between memory and accuracy:\n\nIndex of **1.99 million Vectors**:\n\n```\n4.63 GB (~2KB Per Vector + overhead) with a  8-Bit Quantiser while maintaining around 95-98% Accuracy^\n\n\n\n2.59 GB (~1.15KB Per Vector + overhead) with a 4-Bit Quantiser  while maintaining around 90-95% Accuracy^\n```\n\n\nAdding vectors to this kind of index is slow.\n\n_^accuracy according to official documentation and third party tests_\n", "# Metric Learning - Embedding Model\n\nAnother alternative to using vanilla flat indices with 2048 dimensional fingerprints we explore is the use of a metric learning model to create embeddings that are lower dimensions. We use these embeddings to create flat FAISS indices that are much lighter than the standard fingerprint indices (512, 256, 128, 100 dimensional embeddings vs 2048 dimensional fingerprints). We uses torch's GPU version and enjoy non-trivial speed-ups at training time, while creating embeddings and inference time (FAISS Search using a GPU index).\n\nNote: The searches are performed on a flat index, hence are exact searches, but the using of the embedding model means there is an approximation.", "We are aiming to create compound similarity search models with 4 compound libraries:\n\n- ChemDiv (100k)\n- A representative of Enamine  (~9 million)\n- DrugBank (~11k)\n- COCONUT (should be between 500k and 1 Million)\n\nWe also create a _Metric Learning Embedding Model_ out of a [reference library of 2 million compounds.](https://github.com/ersilia-os/sars-cov-2-chemspace/blob/main/data/reference_library_inchikeys.csv).\n\nFor each of the above libraries the aim is to have 3 variants of indices:\n\n- _A flat IP index with L2 Normalisation_\n    - This is going to be very large for libraries with 500k+ compounds)\n\n- _A compressed IVFPQ IP index  with L2 normalisation (FAISS compression)_\n   - This creates very light indices but as mentioned above there is a loss of search accuracy\n\n- _A flat index created with embeddings from the above mentioned model._\n   - This is lets us create indices that are lighter than vanilla flat indices and also lets us have control and confidence over the accuracy of the search (given that we are confident in the embedding model, which is arguably simpler to benchmark).\n \n", "Implemented a metric learning pipeline that creates learned embeddings from existing flat FAISS index. \n\n### Transforms 2048-dimensional fingerprints → _256/128/100-dimensional learned embeddings_ with cosine similarity\n\n### Triplet sampling: Uses existing 2M compound FAISS index for mining hard positives/negatives\n\nEvaluations: ROC-AUC, AP, distance distributions, t-SNE visualizations\n\nThe pipeline maintains L2 normalization throughout for FlatIP cosine similarity and includes model checkpointing + SMILES mapping for deployment.\n\nCreated with PyTorch + FAISS GPU.

      "url" : "https://github.com/ONEARMY/community-platform/issues/4245",
      "repositoryName" : "ONEARMY/community-platform",
      "description" : "> Do you have attention to detail and would like to work on making the UI nicer? This issue is then for you! :))\n\n## Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.\n1. Comment section is still not matching the designs. The whitespace is lacking between the nested comments and the visually it looks tight, packed and overwhelming.\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6340e9d-7671-4308-acd0-10bf42bffd4b)\n\n2. Additionally the comment on mobile has spacing from the left, leaving the space not being utilised and making the text unnecessarily squeezed.\n<img width=\"361\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28e206b7-fbe6-471c-a2c4-8f09b1284eeb\" />\n\nEspecially with nested comments it becomes obvious:\n<img width=\"361\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86610c32-e365-414c-868e-02621ca54564\" />\n\n3. If the comment has some enters for new line and the the Show more button shows, it creates an awkward space. There is also gap applied.\n<img width=\"918\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a76486ea-e490-4860-940e-c49498ebeb1e\" />\n\n## Describe the solution you'd like\n\nGenerally I think this will need not only adjusting the numbers, but some minor restructuring of the divs. So, let me try to number the improvements:\n\n---\n\n1. Improving the spacings between the nested comments. In the designs there are also the useful buttons in each comment, that are not yet implemented. In the design however, the spacing occurs naturally because of the useful buttons, so I did not need to add a big margin-bottom. I will leave the solution here up to you, but account for the fact that one day in the future we will introduce the useful button for the comment.\n<img width=\"670\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00f1a492-0cfe-4a26-a6d4-a25e9f1e81d2\" />\n\nDon't be afraid to be generous with the spacings, in the devtools i tried 50px as in my designs\n<img width=\"978\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f23db889-05ba-4607-bedc-25d4a4abc321\" />\n\n---\n\n2. Mobile improvement. Here I upload a gif of the solution that I utilised in the Figma designs - it was to hide the left column with the avatar, allowing the text to stretch and then showing the avatar next to the username in 30x30px size.\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/329f7267-8bdb-4d18-a47c-73b7e44d5478)\n\nDon't forget to make sure that the author's badge is working \n<img width=\"502\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b3012c1-567c-4e5e-b781-5f81852bbe28\" />\n\n\n---\n\n3. Putting the Show More button directly under the comment, trimming the whitespaces. \n<img width=\"947\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c07017f7-60f7-4c1c-92f4-859c1267736f\" />\n\n\n---\n\n4. Decreasing the gap here to 5px from 10px\n<img width=\"404\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a1c56f9-11f3-4bd0-9e52-239948b15c2f\" />\n\n\n\n---\n\n5. As you can see, on mobile it gets quite tight. I would suggest removing the word Published from the \"Published x time ago\" information for the comments.\n<img width=\"322\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe06174a-b402-452b-a18b-eefd38b03192\" />\n\n\n---\n\n6. OPTIONAL - In case you would want to act on the point 5. above even more, I would suggest for mobile screens shortening the formulation even more, saying for example 1h ago, 3mo ago or 2yr ago. Reddit does it this way as well.\n\n<img width=\"182\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c194f4c-a4ee-42a1-9c59-dcd5c6b77e42\" />\n\n---\n\n7. OPTIONAL - In case you would still be up for a challenge, having these 2 aligned on the baseline would be a nice achievement, however I didn't manage to get the desired result, since as you can see below, the align-items:baseline does not align them.\n<img width=\"742\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27968c77-de84-400a-8d3f-22e88b37b627\" />\n\n\n\n##  Additional context - [FIGMA FILE HERE](https://www.figma.com/design/XYV3fr8UVOdkNyBmKHHR7f/CP---Comments-Useful---Mobile?node-id=48-79)\nYou can find the figma file above. You can see the components, the desktop and the mobile versions. These design include the correct answer feature or the useful buttons, which are not yet implemented, so feel free to ignore those.\n\n<img width=\"761\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/119c7345-44cf-4baa-9ef6-feed6a05d7ad\" />\n\nIf you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask. :))",

Cool to see that you are up for tackling these design improvements. \n\nJust yesterday we were talking with Ben, that this issue was in his opinion hard to follow and that the screenshots I included could be a bit confusing (some of them with the useful button, some without), so I thought about rewriting it. Is the issue clear to you though? If so, than let's keep it and if you find anything even slightly unclear you can tag me in the comments at any time and I'll be happy to give more clarification. :))\n\nAlso Ben mentioned that he does not have the capacity to prioritise this at the moment, so this would actually be really really helpful and valuable contribution from you. <3\n\nBen was also wrote yesterday that some of the points I mentioned were implemented already. After checking, it was only the point 5. - removing the word \"Published\" from the timestamp.\n\nI will ask the team about implementing the useful counter and let you know. :))", "@dalibormrska  - I think I understand it, but here let me try to summarize and let me know if I am understanding your requests correctly.\n\n\nRequest 1: Increase spacing between the nested comments.\nSolutions:\n- Long Term Solution: Add the Useful Counter to comments which will naturally add whitespace between the comments\n- Easier Solution: Manually add whitespace between the nested comments (which is the space the Useful Counter will take up later)\n\nRequest 2: When viewing comments (especially reply comments) in mobile, the comment text is extremely narrow.\nSolution: Remove the left side margin (make the comment text and profile image be on the same vertical line). Use the smaller version of the profile picture. Basically try to get to this design:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4045704-088e-4a7c-a7ff-bf3d1c5535b3)\n\nRequest 3: If a comment has alot of line breaks, there could be an awkward gap between the comment text and the 'Show more' button\nSolution: Remove line breaks from the end of the comment when hiding the rest of the comment behind the 'Show more' button\n\nRequest 4: Decrease Gap between profile/upload date line and comment body from 10px to 5px\nSolution: This is straight forward :), just decrease gap from 10px to 5px\n\nRequest 5: Remove the 'Published ... time ago' part of the upload date to save space\nSolution: Already Done :)\n\nRequest 6 (OPTIONAL): The upload date still takes alot of space on mobile\nSolution: Use time short hand in mobile. For example, use '5h ago' instead of '5 hours ago' or '4mo ago' instead of '4 months ago'\n\nRequest 7 (OPTIONAL): The user flag, user name, and upload date are not aligned\nSolution: Align the 3 on the baseline", "Cool, well summarised, it's pretty much spot-on. :)) \n\nThe only thing that got trickier since then is the Request 4. If you run the project locally or are a beta-tester, you will see that now the three-dots menu next to the top-comment has been implemented. The three-dots button is huge however, which makes the whole header of the top-comment taller than the replies and therefore makes it hard to achieve consistent gap.\n\nI don't know however what makes the most sense from the coding best practices - but I imagine if you tackle the Request 2. and include the avatar image in the comment header, then the whole header will get the height of the image. I would then suggest trying to make the image size and the three-dots menu size the same - let's try 35x35px and adjusting the gap accordingly.\n\n<img width=\"747\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be0d2dc1-70f8-41db-b36a-7eda73e85eb2\" />\n\nOther than that we just wait for @benfurber to assign. :))", "I'm sceptical of making the avatar too small, otherwise what's the point of showing it.\n\nIt's yours @JCSergent.\n\nOne thing to note, I'm about to implement some icon changes which includes the pointing down arrow in these screenshots." ],

Basically it seems like when the \"Servers\" column is sorted in ascending order, the column is actually sorting in a sort of reverse alphabetical order (\"US-Node-1\" comes first instead of \"Bangalore-Node 1\"). The other columns sort in the expected order based on the sort type.\n\nAs part of this we should take stock of other sortable demos/examples to ensure they're sorting correctly as expected (ignoring columns that don't utilize text, i.e. a \"favorites\" column that only has a star icon button; this will be handled by https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/issues/11006)\n\n**Is this request originating from a Red Hat product team? If so, which ones and is there any sort of deadline for this enhancement?**\n\n**Any other information?**\n",

Although you say it didn’t work, were there any techniques that says it detected? \n\nIn the meantime, I’ll try to find something that could be used as a detection in UTM-VM, but there’s no guarantees. It’s a hard process and the codebase for that project is huge.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that MacOS techniques aren’t our speciality. Although we support it, we don’t really maintain it as Linux and Windows are the most demanded platforms for this sort of project.", "@kernelwernel Thanks for the response, \n\n\nBut I think I have found the solution for that, I have added one more check for detection of Hypervisor in MAC and it helped me.\n\n`sysctl kern.hv_vmm_present` \n\nit helped me to detect UTM.", "@AdnanAhad That’s incredibly useful to know, thanks! What does that command output for UTM exactly? I’d like to know so I can add an official new technique to the library. Credit will also be given obviously :)" ],

While I don't have a fix yet, we've previously encountered a very similar issue before (https://github.com/kernelwernel/VMAware/issues/359) and all we've done to fix it was by detecting binary translation environments and blacklisting (if found) for those specific techniques, and I'm pretty sure this is the path we'll take but I need to consult with my co-dev (@NotRequiem) who manages these techniques. I assume he's sleeping at the moment, but I'll let him know about the issue.\n\n> You can see in that all hypervisor registers are all zeroes.\n\nThat technique isn't really relevant in this scenario, it's relatively common to have that output.\n\n> I know that a normal hypervisor will return a bendstring when calling CPUID EAX=0x40000000. However, it is a bit strange to see that it is detected as a VM even though it is all 0.\n\nI assume you meant \"brand string\" instead of bendstring, but this is also not surprising since it's a binary translator. I *assume* you have Microsoft PRISM doing the x86 to ARM translation, which isn't really accurate to call it an emulator in itself but that's besides the point.\n\nA lot of funky stuff happens when the binary is being translated to a different ISA, but we still do our best to keep it as compatible as possible with the same core mechanisms we've done for real x86 hardware.

A simple x seconds delay configurable from the yaml file would allow users to slow down crawls.\r\n\r\nThis is similar to https://github.com/elastic/crawler/issues/46 (abiding by `Crawl-delay` in robots.txt). However, a general delay would be useful for users who can't or don't want to change the robots.txt.\r\n\r\nWhen both are implemented, the highest value of the two should be used for the crawl delay.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Solution\r\n\r\nAdd a configurable crawl delay in yaml file.\r\n\r\n### Additional Context\r\n\r\nLink to discuss forum: https://discuss.elastic.co/t/apply-delay-between-requests-in-elastic-crawler/361375/4\r\n",

      "description" : "## Guideline\n1. Carefully read the issue description before applying to ensure you have all the necessary information to start working on it.\n2. Write a brief description of how you will approach the task (without using ChatGPT).\n3. Add your Telegram handler in your application (e.g., in OnlyDust or similar)\n4. Write ETA in your application\n\n\n\n## What should I do if I have a problem\n1. Try to google it before asking. Googling is taking major part of dev work \n2. If you couldn't find answer your question with Google, text your question to [dev](https://t.me/spotnet_dev/4) group with your question.\n3. Do not send DM to maintainer, it would be better and faster to ask other contributors in chat \n\n\n## How to prepare PR\n1. Check if your code [smell](https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/smells) good\n2.  Add `close #<issue number>` to link your issue with your PR\n3.  Do not commit changes which is not related to your task \n4. Check after you created PR, if you committed everything.\n\n## Task description  \n1. Create a `POST /signup` endpoint that accepts only the user's email in the request body:\n```json\n{\n  \"email\": \"user@example.com\"\n}\n```\n\n2. Check if the email already exists in the database (e.g. pre-created by a super admin).\n3. If valid, generate a JWT token that encodes the email.\n4. Send a confirmation email with a link in the following format:\n\n```python\nf'{app_base_url}/signup-confirmation?token={token}'\n```\n\n5. Add `app_base_url` to your settings (if it's not already present).\n6. Do not return any sensitive info in the response.\n7. Add appropriate tests to cover:\n\n   * New signup attempt\n   * Already existing email\n   * Proper link generation\n   * Email delivery trigger\n\n**NOTE: This refers to the admin entity**",

I'm not sure if a diff is the best way to go or not (presumably that would go into benchmarking since it would have to be PR vs. Master). \n\nThe easiest way to get a merge in, that could possibly be migrated to benchmarking later, would be to just run the nsys command with appropriate flags, and it will tell you what the most expensive subroutines are. We have some documentation on nsight profiling in the MFC docs `./mfc.sh run <...> --profile` should work I think. But I think that will just create a report file you look at in the GUI.

      "description" : "## Guideline\n1. Carefully read the issue description before applying to ensure you have all the necessary information to start working on it.\n2. Write a brief description of how you will approach the task (without using ChatGPT).\n3. Add your Telegram handler in your application (e.g., in OnlyDust or similar)\n4. Write ETA in your application\n\n\n\n## What should I do if I have a problem\n1. Try to google it before asking. Googling is taking major part of dev work \n2. If you couldn't find answer your question with Google, text your question to [dev](https://t.me/spotnet_dev/4) group with your question.\n3. Do not send DM to maintainer, it would be better and faster to ask other contributors in chat \n\n\n## How to prepare PR\n1. Check if your code [smell](https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/smells) good\n2. Add `close #<issue number>` to link your issue with your PR\n3. Do not commit changes that are unrelated to your task\n4. Check after you created PR, if you committed everything\n\n\n## Task Description\n1. In the [handlers folder](./blob/main/margin/margin_app/app/telegram/handlers), create a new file named `admin.py`. Inside, add a handler called `/assets`. Use the [`Admin Filter` from this issue](https://github.com/djeck1432/spotnet/issues/915) to verify the user is an admin. Then, call the [`Assets statistic` method from this issue](https://github.com/djeck1432/spotnet/issues/906) to retrieve the data. Format the response using Telegram Markdown so it displays neatly.\n2. Provide a screenshot demonstrating that the handler works as expected.\n",

It makes sense for DagRun with multiple versions, but I don't think we should be able to explore DagVersions that are not part of the selected dagrun at all. \n\nIt makes it hard to follow when we start playing with the `version selector` when a DagRun is selected. (Is the DagVersion that I have selected part of the DagRun.dag_versions, or am I watching a completely unrelated structure)\n\n\nFor instance in the following image I have the `v2` structure displayed for a DagRun that actually only has `v4` part of his versions. The output graph doesn't make much sense.\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb45d6a5-514f-464e-b756-39c8b0a70c39)\n\n\nI do not know yet what is the best way to address this, any idea is welcome.\n### Committer\n\n- [x] I acknowledge that I am a maintainer/committer of the Apache Airflow project.",

The directory includes artifacts that meet the CR requirements, along with PGP signatures for every file. I'm fairly sure, given the actual error below, that the artifacts themselves don't matter.\n\nI have the following `jreleaser.toml`:\n\n```\n[deploy.maven.mavenCentral.sonatype]\nactive = \"ALWAYS\"\nsign = false\nurl = \"https://central.sonatype.com/api/v1/publisher\"\nstagingRepositories = [\"build/maven\"]\n```\n\nI run jreleaser:\n\n```\n$ env

      "description" : "# Fork, Commit, Merge - Medium Issue 2 (React.js)\r\n\r\n## Create a Traffic Light Component\r\n*Note: You don't have ask permission to start solving the issue or get assigned, since these issues are supposed to be always open for new contributors. The actions-user bot will reset the file back to previous state for the next contributor after your commit is merged. So you can just simply start working with the issue right away!*\r\n\r\n### How to get started:\r\n\r\nStart by navigating inside of the directory used in this project with the command:\r\n```bash\r\ncd tasks/react/medium/traffic-light\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen run `npm i` to install Vite, React and all the necessary dependencies for the project.\r\n\r\nAfter installing the dependencies you can open the `src` directory and the `TrafficLight.tsx` file, and start implementing your solution!\r\n\r\n![react-medium](https://github.com/fork-commit-merge/fork-commit-merge/assets/82566656/e154750d-41fd-4db4-bcc6-9dd52c7e55d6)\r\n\r\n### Description:\r\n\r\nCreate a React component using TypeScript that simulates a traffic light. The component should display three lights (red, yellow, and green) and switch between them automatically in the order of a typical traffic light sequence.\r\n\r\n### Requirements:\r\n\r\n-   Implement a `TrafficLight` component in `src/TrafficLight.tsx`.\r\n-   Use TypeScript for type safety.\r\n-   The component should render three circles, colored red, yellow, and green.\r\n-   The traffic light should start with the red light.\r\n-   After a few seconds, it should change to green, then yellow, and then back to red in a continuous loop.\r\n-   Only one light should be \"active\" (brighter) at a time.\r\n\r\nThere are some CSS classes already added for you in the `src/App.css` file, which you can use if you like, or write your own custom CSS.\r\nThere is for example a helper pseudo-class selector for every light that is not active, which will set the light color to gray if the light does not have the `active` class:\r\n\r\n![react-medium-css](https://github.com/fork-commit-merge/fork-commit-merge/assets/82566656/052aaf61-e4d9-40b9-8876-bf96aa2ada9c)\r\n\r\n### Example:\r\n\r\nThe traffic light should cycle as follows:\r\n\r\n-   Red (active) for 4 seconds.\r\n-   Green (active) for 3 seconds.\r\n-   Yellow (active) for 1 second.\r\n-   Repeat the cycle.\r\n\r\n## How to run:\r\nAfter you are done with the card, make sure you are in the `tasks/react/medium/traffic-light` in your terminal and run `npm run dev` to start the Vite server. Then, open \"http://localhost:5173/\" in your browser to check how the app looks.\r\n\r\nIf it looks to be working fine, you are ready to make a pull request!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo work with this issue, you need to have npm and NodeJS installed to your local machine.\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions of installing npm and NodeJS as well as how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Why use Vite?\r\n\r\nThis React project uses Vite for near-instant server start-ups and incredibly fast hot module replacements, providing a smooth and efficient development experience.\r\nAlso Vite requires minimal setup, allowing us to focus on writing React code without getting bogged down in complex configurations.\r\nIf you want to learn more about Vite, check out the documentation:\r\n[Vite Official Documentation](https://vitejs.dev/)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

      "description" : "## Summary\n\nAdd a ```blob([mimeType: string])``` method to ```DotNetStreamReference``` in Blazor, allowing developers to obtain a Blob from a .NET stream in JavaScript, without fully loading the stream into memory. We chose this specific issue, because it is a \"good-first-issue\" and we are participating in a germany wide competition, where the subject is to work on issues in open source projects. \nLink to issue: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/47685\n\n## Motivation and goals\n\nBlazor developers can currently pass .NET streams to JavaScript using ```DotNetStreamReference```, which exposes two main methods:\n- ```stream()``` (returns a ReadableStream)\n- ```arrayBuffer()``` (loads the full stream into memory)\n\nThe problem:\n- There is no direct way to obtain a Blob, which is required for many web APIs (like ```<video>``` elements, file downloads or drag-and-drop functionality).\n- ```arrayBuffer()``` is not suitable for large files (like videos) because it fully buffers the stream in memory before use.\n- Using ```stream()``` gives a ReadableStream, but many APIs (like ```<video src=...>```, ```URL.createObjectURL()```) require a Blob, not a stream, and converting a ReadableStream into a Blob in JS is non-trivial and inefficient.\n\nAdding a ```blob()``` method would:\n- Allow efficient handling of large files (like video or audio) without consuming excessive memory.\n- Simplify developer workflows by aligning with common web APIs that expect a Blob.\n- Close a usability gap in the current Blazor-JS interop system.\n\n## In scope\n\n- A new method ```blob([mimeType: string])``` on ```DotNetStreamReference``` that returns a Blob representing the .NET stream.\n- Ensuring the Blob can be used with standard web APIs (e.g., ```<video>```, ```<audio>```, ```URL.createObjectURL()```).\n- Keeping performance and memory usage efficient for large streams.\n\n## Out of scope\n\n- Changes to the existing stream() or arrayBuffer() methods.\n- Polyfills for browsers that lack Blob support (modern browsers are assumed).\n- Enhancements to streaming APIs beyond providing the Blob.\n\n## Risks / unknowns\n- **Browser behavior**: While Blobs are widely supported, the implementation detail of\nstreaming data into a Blob without full buffering might depend on browser internals.\nSome browsers may still buffer the entire Blob in memory before making it available.\n\n- **Memory use**: Even if we avoid buffering in .NET or JS, the underlying browser may still\nend up consuming memory when the Blob is accessed, especially for very large files.\n\n- **Implementation complexity**: Creating a Blob from a .NET stream across JS interop\nmight require platform-level work to ensure true streaming behavior rather than just\nbuffering and converting.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Blazor usage example\n```blazor\n<video @ref=\"videoPlayer\" controls autoplay></video>\n\n<button @onclick=\"PlayVideo\">Play Streamed Video</button>\n\n@code {\n    private ElementReference videoPlayer;\n\n    private async Task PlayVideo()\n    {\n        using var fileStream = File.OpenRead(\"bigvideo.mp4\");\n        var streamRef = new DotNetStreamReference(fileStream);\n\n        // JS call to create a blob URL from the .NET stream\n        var videoUrl = await JS.InvokeAsync<string>(\"createVideoBlobUrl\", streamRef);\n\n        // Set the video source\n        await JS.InvokeVoidAsync(\"setVideoSrc\", videoPlayer, videoUrl);\n    }\n}\n```\n### JavaScript interop\n```JavaScript\nwindow.createVideoBlobUrl = async function (streamRef) {\n    const blob = await streamRef.blob(\"video/mp4\");\n    return URL.createObjectURL(blob);\n};\n\nwindow.setVideoSrc = function (videoElement, src) {\n    videoElement.src = src;\n};\n```\n",

The \"insider way to do this is to append `/#/ipfs-sw-config` to the subdomain URI which will load the config page. \n\n\n@SgtPooki and I discussed some ideas on how to solve this:\n- Add a query parameter to disable the config redirect\n- Removing the config redirect by default (also a minor perf win)\n- Using the IPFS Companion extension to detect the SW and either allowing config from there or a button linking you to the config hash fragment ", "for now I think the config redirect is a pretty good improvement while not adding much latency. It is also extremely useful for testing, tbh, but also some potential future privacy/security concerns. We can disable or adjust easily in the future once we get the config in companion or get more feedback that folks really don't care about the shared config at all." ],

      "description" : "# Background\nHi community,\n\nShardingSphere's parser engine enables users to parse SQL into AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) and convert it into SQLStatement objects. \nThis issue focuses on enhancing MySQL stored procedure parsing capabilities to support complex database programming logic.\n\nMore details:\nhttps://shardingsphere.apache.org/document/current/en/reference/sharding/parse/\n\n# Issue Background Explanation\n\nThese SQL statements are from the official MySQL test set. \nYou can find the corresponding stored procedure SQL statements in the following website: https://github.com/mysql/mysql-server/tree/8.0/mysql-test/t \nThese SQL cases are then passed to ShardingSphere's parsing engine for analysis. \nFor SQL cases that fail to be parsed successfully, every 3 to 5 SQL cases are grouped together as an issue.\n1. It cannot be guaranteed that all SQL cases are correct. Please follow the following process to handle this pull request (PR).\n2. Some SQL cases may have already been fixed in other PRs. For cases that can already be executed successfully, simply leave a comment to ignore them.\n3. If a SQL case can be executed successfully without any code changes, there is no need to add a corresponding test assert file.\n\n# Task\nThis issue requires adding support for the following MySQL stored procedure syntax:\n```sql\n-- The original file and line number of the sql: analyze:85 \nCREATE PROCEDURE p() ANALYZE TABLE v UPDATE HISTOGRAM ON w\n```\n\n```sql\n-- The original file and line number of the sql: change_user_deadlock:35 \nEND |\nCREATE PROCEDURE p_processlist()\nBEGIN\nDECLARE x INT DEFAULT 3000\n```\n\n```sql\n-- The original file and line number of the sql: change_user_deadlock:26 \nCREATE PROCEDURE p_flush_status()\nBEGIN\nDECLARE x INT DEFAULT 3000\n```\n\n```sql\n-- The original file and line number of the sql: clear_diag_area:254 \nCREATE PROCEDURE p7_show_warnings ()\nBEGIN\nSHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'foo';\nSHOW WARNINGS;\nSELECT \"(SHOW WARNINGS does not have to come last)\";\nEND\n```\n\n```sql\n-- The original file and line number of the sql: clear_diag_area:263 \nCREATE PROCEDURE p8b_show_warnings ()\nBEGIN\nSHOW WARNINGS;\nEND\n```\n\n\n# Overall Procedure\nIf you intend to participate in fixing this issue, please feel free to leave a comment below the issue. Community members will assign the issue accordingly.\nFor example, you can leave a comment like this: \"Hi, please assign this issue to me. Thank you!\"\n\nOnce you have claimed the issue, please review the syntax of the SQL on the official website of the corresponding database. \nExecute the SQL on the respective database to ensure the correctness of the SQL syntax.\n\nYou can check the corresponding source of each SQL case on the official database website.\nNext, execute the problematic SQL cases mentioned above in the database (you can quickly start the corresponding database using the Docker image for that database, and then connect to it using a client you are  familiar with), to ensure that the SQL syntax itself is correct.\n\n\nOnce you have confirmed the correctness of the SQL syntax, you can validate and fix the grammar parsing issue in ShardingSphere.\n>If you are using IntelliJ IDEA, you will need to install the ANTLR plugin before proceeding.\nIf it is an ANTLR parsing error message, try to repair the `.g4` file by comparing it with the official database syntax until the SQL can be correctly parsed by ANTLR.\nWhen there is no error message in the ANTLR Preview window, it means that ANTLR can correctly parse the SQL.\n\n\nAfter ANTLR parses SQL into an abstract syntax tree, ShardingSphere will access the abstract syntax tree through Visitor and extract the required information.\nIf you need to extract Segments, you need to first execute:\n```shell\nmvn -T 2C clean install -DskipTests\n```\nUnder the shardingsphere-parser module to compile the entire parser module.\nThen rewrite the corresponding visit method in SQLStatementVisitorr as needed to extract the corresponding Segment.\n\n\nAfter the above SQL parsing problem is repaired, the corresponding Test needs to be added.\nThe steps are as follows:\n1. Add the corresponding `sql-case` in the `sql/supported` directory.\n2. Add case assertions in the case directory of the `shardingsphere-test-it-parser` module.\n3. Run `org.apache.shardingsphere.test.it.sql.parser.internal.InternalSQLParserIT`\nAfter SQL Parser IT runs successfully, you can submit a PR.\n\n\n1. Master JAVA language\n2. Have a basic understanding of Antlr g4 file\n3. Be familiar with MySQL SQLs",

So you can just simply start working with the issue right away!*\r\n\r\n## How to get started\r\n\r\nStart by opening the `tasks/python/medium` directory from the root of the project. \r\nThen open `bubble_sort.py` file and start working on your solution!\r\n\r\n![python-medium](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/assets/82566656/b32978ed-2a26-48d8-9bd4-322cf1916586)\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThe goal of this issue is to implement the bubble sort algorithm in Python. The function should be able to sort an array of integers in ascending order. You should create a function called `bubble_sort` to accomplish this.\r\n*Note: Do not use the `sort` function or any similar methods to solve this task.*\r\n\r\n## How to run\r\n\r\nMake sure you are in the right directory:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncd tasks/python/medium\r\n```\r\n\r\nExecute the following command to run your Python script:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npython bubble_sort.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected output\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nOriginal array: [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]\r\nSorted array: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the output looks correct, you are ready to make a pull request!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo work with this issue, you need to have Python installed to your local machine.\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions of installing Python and how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

I'm interested in working on this issue. Based on my understanding, the problem occurs when KubeFlex tries to use a stored context from the kubeconfig extensions that is either invalid or no longer exists.\n\nI'm planning to implement a solution that would:\n1. Validate the stored context before using it\n2. Add proper fallback logic when an invalid context is detected\n3. Provide clear user feedback about what's happening\n\nIs this approach aligned with what you're looking for? Are there any additional considerations I should be aware of before I start working on a PR?", "UPDATE:\n\nStarting #386 - kubeflex changes its usage of kubeconfig extensions (see https://github.com/kubestellar/kubeflex/blob/main/docs/users.md#v090)\n\nIn kubeflex, extensions are easier to use thanks to our internal package https://github.com/kubestellar/kubeflex/tree/main/pkg/kubeconfig\n\nAs consequences, the key `kflex-initial-ctx-name` is outdated.

This is either an upstream issue or we might need to switch over to using [proxy-agent](https://www.npmjs.com/package/proxy-agent) from the same maintainer, which proxies \uD83D\uDE02 calls based on the set env-variables.\n\nMid/Long-term, Bitwarden CLI will likely benefit moving over to using native NodeJS fetch support and proxy via [undici](https://github.com/nodejs/undici). I looked into this a while ago, but it hasn't been a priority to migrate.\n\nMarking this as good first issue, in case anyone would like to start investigating.\n\nKind regards,\nDaniel", "@djsmith85 @frq-asgard-josi\n\nI did some digging, and here's my theory.\n\n[proxy-agent](https://github.com/TooTallNate/proxy-agents/blob/main/packages/proxy-agent) depends on [proxy-from-env](https://github.com/Rob--W/proxy-from-env) to process proxy-related environment variables.\n\nThe [logic](https://github.com/Rob--W/proxy-from-env/blob/master/index.js#L64) in `proxy-from-env` for interpreting `NO_PROXY` may be the root cause.\n\n```js\nfunction shouldProxy(hostname, port) {\n  var NO_PROXY =\n    (getEnv('npm_config_no_proxy') || getEnv('no_proxy')).toLowerCase();\n  if (!NO_PROXY) {\n    return true;  // Always proxy if NO_PROXY is not set.\n  }\n  if (NO_PROXY === '*') {\n    return false;  // Never proxy if wildcard is set.\n  }\n}\nfunction getEnv(key) {\n  return process.env[key.toLowerCase()] || process.env[key.toUpperCase()] || '';\n}\n```\n\n`npm_config_no_proxy` has higher priority, and if set, `no_proxy` or `NO_PROXY` won't be effective. This [issue](https://github.com/Rob--W/proxy-from-env/issues/13) and [fix](https://github.com/Rob--W/proxy-from-env/pull/27) are still open.\n" ],

      "repositoryName" : "ethereum/execution-spec-tests",
      "description" : "This is a top-level issue for tracking the manual porting of ethereum/tests test cases to execution-spec-tests:\r\n\r\n> **Contributions to manually port individual test cases are very welcome!**\r\n\r\n**If you're already familiar with ethereum/tests and execution-spec-tests, jump to the issue tracker below!**\r\n\r\n#### Background\r\n[ethereum/tests](https://github.com/ethereum/tests) was the repository used to define EVM test cases from [Frontier](https://ethereum.org/en/history/#frontier) up to and including [The Merge](https://ethereum.org/en/history/#paris). The test cases are defined as YAML (and sometimes JSON) files in the [./src/ sub-directory](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/tree/develop/src) and the JSON \"test fixtures\" (fully-populated tests that can be executed against clients) are generated using [ethereum/retesteth](https://github.com/ethereum/retesteth). These JSON artifacts are regenerated when required and added to the repository, for example, in the [./GeneralStateTests/ sub-directory](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/tree/develop/GeneralStateTests).\r\n\r\nFrom [Shanghai](https://ethereum.org/en/history/#shapella) on, new test cases (in particular for new features included in hard-forks) have been defined in Python in this repository (execution-spec-tests). The existing test cases are still important to execute against clients, however, and porting ethereum/tests to execution-spec-tests ensures that the test cases can be continually maintained and filled (generated) for newer forks. It also has the advantage that client teams will only need to obtain test fixture releases from one source.\r\n\r\n#### Automated Port to Python\r\nAlthough there will be an effort to automate (\"transpile\") the remaining test cases from YAML (respectively JSON) to Python; contributions to manually port individual test cases can be very beneficial and are welcome! \r\n\r\nThe benefits of manual porting are:\r\n1. Reduce the number of test cases by combing multiple YAML (resp. JSON) test cases in one Python test function (via parametrization).\r\n2. Potentially improve coverage by parametrizing the Python version.\r\n3. Code/docstrings are likely higher quality than an automated conversion.\r\n4. The test can be better [organized within the `./tests` folder](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-spec-tests/main/writing_tests/adding_a_new_test/) in execution-spec-tests by the fork and the EIP in which the functionality was introduced.\r\n\r\n#### Process\r\n1. Pick a single or a set of YAML test cases in ethereum/tests to port and create an issue in this repository - optional, but definitely recommended if porting tests from the tracker below to avoid duplicate work.\r\n2. Create a PR with the ported tests:\r\n    a. Add the list of ported YAML files to [converted-ethereum-tests.txt](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/blob/1b30c336eae6b0746ea4db441ac74406f2fb2322/converted-ethereum-tests.txt).\r\n    b. If the tests can't currently be filled, please explain the issue (feel free to also [open a Discussion](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/discussions/new?category=general)).\r\n\r\n#### Help with ethereum/tests\r\n\r\nThe test formats are described in the [ethereum/tests online docs](https://ethereum-tests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/blockchain-ref.html). Note that state filler test cases in YAML can be parametrized, see the [docs here](https://ethereum-tests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/test_filler/state_filler.html#the-indexes).\r\n\r\n#### Hints to Get Started with ethereum/execution-spec-tests\r\n\r\n0. Start here: [Getting Started → Installation](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-spec-tests/main/getting_started/installation/).\r\n1. Use `uv run et make test` to create a template test module (currently a WIP in #950).\r\n2. Where to put the test? See how tests are organized in [Writing Tests → Adding a New Test](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-spec-tests/main/writing_tests/adding_a_new_test/).\r\n3. State vs Blockchain test? If in doubt try to write a state test, see [Writing Tests → Types of Tests → Deciding on a Test Type](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-spec-tests/main/writing_tests/types_of_tests/#deciding-on-a-test-type).\r\n4. Tests are filled via EELS by default (no further installation necessary; it's a Python dependency and got installed in Step 0), see [Filling  → Getting Started](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-spec-tests/main/filling_tests/getting_started/).\r\n5. Parametrizing test functions is encouraged, see [Writing Tests → Writing a New Test → Parametrizing Tests](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-spec-tests/main/writing_tests/writing_a_new_test/#parametrizing-tests).\r\n6. The Opcode mini-lang defined in this repository is the preferred way to define bytecode in tests (if feasible). For a very simple example, see [`test_chainid()`](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/blob/85393456e75f5f3b476cb5e61c35d48172f9d543/tests/istanbul/eip1344_chainid/test_chainid.py#L28) - there are other examples in the tests.\r\n\r\nFeel free to reach out for help or guidance in the Ethereum R&D discord or via DM; see [Getting Help](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-spec-tests/main/getting_started/getting_help/) in the docs.\r\n\r\n```[tasklist]\r\n### Test Cases\r\n- [ ] Add test cases for any single opcode (porting an entire test case from ethereum/tests can be overwhelming;

As which language is spoken is very different for every location, we want a text field, and hope the cms users will fill it with, e.g. \"on thursday afternoon russian, on other days only german an englisch\", or similar.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposed Solution\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of the feature you would like to add, and how it solves the motivating problem. -->\r\nShow the text that can be entered in the cms for every poi containing information about languages in web and native.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered, and why you're proposed solution is better. -->\r\nWe discussed if we just tell the cms users to add this information to the description field, but having this field is a constant reminder and as it is a important feature for the target group, we decided adding this field is the best way to go.\r\n\r\n### User Story\r\n<!-- A clear description of the User Stories that should be achieved by the new feature. The User Stories should follow this pattern:-->\r\nAs a app user I want know if at a poi my language is spoken so that I know if it is worth for me to go there.\r\n\r\n### Additional Context\r\n<!-- Add any other information or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\r\nSee: https://openproject.tuerantuer.org/projects/community-feedback/work_packages/3231/activity\r\n\r\n### Design Requirements\r\n<!-- If the customization includes input from our design team, the detailed requirements will be collected here. Note: These will exist mainly in German to simplify internal communication. -->\r\nNone.\r\n\r\nblocked by https://github.com/digitalfabrik/integreat-cms/issues/2799",

      "description" : "**Describe the bug**\n\n\n**To Reproduce**\n\n1. Checkout and build [Camunda Example Twitter](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/camunda-8-examples/tree/main/twitter-review-java-springboot)\n\n2. Set appropriate configuration properties to connect to your cluster/instance\n```\nzeebe.client.cloud.clusterId=...\nzeebe.client.cloud.clientId=SJqG7ve....\nzeebe.client.cloud.clientSecret=...\nzeebe.client.cloud.region=...\nzeebe.client.cloud.auth-url=...\nzeebe.client.cloud.base-url=...\n```\n\n3. Set environment variable \n```\nZEEBE_CLIENT_CONFIG_PATH=/tmp\n```\n\n4. Run the application and see some errors on the console regarding authentication issues.\n\n```\nat io.camunda.zeebe.client.impl.ZeebeClientFutureImpl.join(ZeebeClientFutureImpl.java:52) ~[zeebe-client-java-8.6.7.jar:8.6.7]\n\t... 32 common frames omitted\nCaused by: io.grpc.StatusRuntimeException: UNAUTHENTICATED: HTTP status code 401\ninvalid content-type: text/html\nheaders: Metadata(:status=401,date=Fri, 24 Jan 2025 14:49:06 GMT,content-type=text/html,www-authenticate=Bearer token_type=\"JWT\",strict-transport-security=max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains,content-length=172)\nDATA-----------------------------\n<html>\n<head><title>401 Authorization Required</title></head>\n<body>\n<center><h1>401 Authorization Required</h1></center>\n<hr><center>nginx</center>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n**Expected behavior**\n\nFor a better developer experience, the client should at least log an error to the console. But ideally should abort the bootstrapping with a useful error message mentioning which property is wrongly configured.\n\n**Log/Stacktrace**\n\n\n\uD83D\uDC40 \n**We do indeed raise an exception, when a directory is configured instead of a file (see [here](https://github.com/camunda/camunda/blob/ed8a807969f040fdb55b575a9e31fef957fd8d5e/clients/java/src/main/java/io/camunda/zeebe/client/impl/oauth/OAuthCredentialsProviderBuilder.java#L251)) and\nthe exception bubbles up to `PropertyUtil.java` (see [here](https://github.com/camunda/camunda/blob/cbef3b18134bbd4198456c293206bef2eab726f9/clients/spring-boot-starter-camunda-sdk/src/main/java/io/camunda/zeebe/spring/client/configuration/PropertyUtil.java#L98)) where the error is logged with `DEBUG` level!**\n\uD83D\uDC40 \n\nThus in order to see the message on the console the log level of the spring application needs to be changed\n(You will still see a lot of noise on the log, because the client still continues to bootstrap)\n\n```\nlogging.level.root=DEBUG\n```\n\nSee stack trace and error message below.\n\n<details><summary>Full Stacktrace</summary>\n

It would be a great idea to formalise this as a trait. By doing so:\n- We can reference this method without the compiler needing to know what type it is\n- We can ensure that this behaviour is guaranteed across vector stores.\n\nThis would also be a good chance to implement a new, different type of `insert_docs` method that also takes a user-defined ID generation strategy (although perhaps out of initial scope for the first PR).\n\n### Motivation\n<!--\nPlease describe the use case(s) or other motivation for the new feature.\n-->\nBetter UX, better type reusability.\n\n### Proposal\n<!--\nHow should the new feature be implemented, and why? Add any considered\ndrawbacks.\n-->\nMove all `insert_document` methods under a new `InsertDocuments` trait.\n\n### Alternatives\n<!--\nAre there other ways to solve this problem that you've considered?

      "description" : "# \uD83C\uDF1F Open Call for Contributions: Gemma 3n Recipes \uD83D\uDC8E\n\nHello community! \uD83D\uDC4B\n\nWe got really excited last week with the full release of [Gemma 3n](https://huggingface.co/blog/gemma3n) \uD83D\uDC8E by Google DeepMind. With that, we’d like to open this call for contributions to explore the amazing recipes the community can build with it!\n\nThis project follows the same principles as our previous [Hugging Face Llama Recipes](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface-llama-recipes), which you might also want to check out. You can refer to that repository to see the previous [call for contributions](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface-llama-recipes/issues/43) and discover what the community created. You may also want to browse the [Gemma Cookbook](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemma-cookbook) for further inspiration.\n\n> Star the project to boost it! :star:\n\n## \uD83D\uDCA1 What You Could Build\n\nGemma 3n is specifically designed for low-resource (on-device) environments and is a **multimodal model** that supports text, image, video, and audio inputs — so we’d love to see projects where those capabilities shine! ✨ We highly recommend checking out the [blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/gemma3n) to better understand the possibilities and spark your creativity.\n\nYou could:\n- Showcase agentic or interactive uses of the model\n- Build recipes using `transformers`, `llama.cpp`, or `transformers.js`\n- Create fine-tuning notebooks for domain-specific tasks using any of the supported modalities\n- Or anything else that pushes the boundaries of on-device and multimodal AI! \uD83E\uDD16\n\nHave your own idea?\uD83D\uDCA1 Even better, we’d love to hear it!\n\n## \uD83D\uDCDD How to Contribute\n\n1. **Open a New Issue**\n   - If you’re interested in contributing, please [open a new issue](#) with a descriptive title.\n   - Use the issue to outline your idea and gather early feedback.\n\n2. **Let Us Know**\n   - Comment on this post to let us know you’ve opened a new issue. We’ll update the main list with a link to your idea.\n\n3. **Start Building**\n   - Once you’ve shaped your plan, go ahead and implement your idea \uD83D\uDC68‍\uD83D\uDCBB.\n\n4. **Submit a Pull Request**\n   - When you’re ready, open a Pull Request (PR) that links back to your issue.\n   - Mention the issue in your PR description so it's easy to track.\n\n5. **Update the README**\n   - Don’t forget to add a short description of your contribution to the `README.md`, so others can find and reuse it easily.\n\n## \uD83D\uDCAC For New Contributors\n\nIf you’re just starting out in open source, we recommend reading our [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface-gemma-recipes/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md). It includes helpful tips to get you up and running.\n\nWe can’t wait to see what we’ll build together! \uD83E\uDD20\n",

To this aim, unfortunately, they often convert a Psydac vector to a NumPy array, which is unnecessarily expensive:\n```python\nerror = a - b\nassert np.linalg.norm(error.toarray()) < TOL\n```\nInstead, the same result can be obtained by using the method `inner` of our `Vector` objects, without any unnecessary memory allocation:\n```python\n# Define 2-norm of vector using inner\nnorm2 = lambda v: sqrt(v.inner(v))\n\nerror = a - b\nassert norm2(error) < TOL\n```",

      "comments" : [ "While refactoring the `test_operator_evaluation` function (`/linalg/tests/test_linalg.py`) to remove all `.toarray() `(to better leverage PSYDAC’s native vector/matrix structures and improve efficiency), I noticed that the current computation of the variable `error_est` relies on a full dense inverse via:\n\n```\nBmat = B.toarray()\n\nB_inv_mat = np.linalg.inv(Bmat)\nb_inv_arr = np.matrix.flatten(B_inv_mat)\nerror_est = 2 + n1 * n2 * np.max([np.abs(b_inv_arr[i]) for i in range(len(b_inv_arr))])\n\n```\nSince we’re avoiding those dense NumPy operations for performance and memory reasons, I believe this calculation of `error_est` no longer fits well in the new context. Computing the full inverse matrix is computationally expensive and somewhat contradictory to the iterative sparse methods we’re testing.\n\nCould you suggest an alternative approach for `error_est`?\nFor example, I’m considering replacing it with a simpler, lightweight estimate such as:\n\n`error_est = {some num > 0}* n1 * n2`\n", "This is an error estimate based on the maximum absolute value of the inverse matrix. It could read in fact\n```python\nerror_est = np.linalg.norm(Bmat.flat, np.inf)\n```\nwhich is the inf-norm of the vectorized matrix. This does not seem to give a sharp estimate, given that it is multiplied by a small number just below (`tol = 1e-5`). Maybe @jowezarek could shed some light on this?", "@anushkasinghh @yguclu \nThanks for bringing this up, this code snipped is ridiculously complicated and doesn't do what it's supposed to do :')\n\nThe explicit matrix inverse was never truly needed, and yet there's no time to gain as the entire test ran in < 3 seconds on my machine.\n\nThis particular part of the test was designed to test whether power operations (**0, **1, **2) work with inverse linear operators (ILOs).\n\nThe poorly executed idea of the test was the following:\n```python\n# arbitrary tolerance\ntol = \n\n# Define 2-norm of vector using inner (as proposed by Yaman)\nnorm2 = lambda v: sqrt(v.inner(v))\n\n# Psydac objects, solver with tolerance = tol\nu\nB_ILO = inverse(B, 'cg', tol=tol)\n\n# First test: Check whether B_ILO**0 is the identity matrix (B_ILO**0 = id?)\n\nerror = (B_ILO**0) @ u - u\nassert norm2(error) < 1e-15 # error should really be zero\n\n# Second test: Check whether B_ILO**1 really computes the inverse up to accuracy (B_ILO**1 = B_ILO?)\n# I.e., we expect B @ B_ILO**1 @ u to be equal to u + err, err a vector of norm less than tol\n\nerror = B @ B_ILO**1 @ u - u\nassert norm2(error) < tol\n\n# Third test: Now checking whether B_ILO**2 is really equal to a double application of B_ILO (B_ILO**2 = B_ILO @ B_ILO?)\n# B @ B @ B_ILO @ B_ILO @ u = B @ ( B_ILO @ u + err1 ) = u + err2 + B @ err1\n# where both err1 and err2 are vectors of norm less than tol, hence\n# | B @ B @ B_ILO @ B_ILO @ u - u | = | err2 + B @ err1 | < | err2 | + | B @ err1 | < tol + |B|_{inf} * tol = (1 + |B|_{inf}) * tol\n\nadjusted_tol = ( 1 + np.max(np.abs(B.toarray())) ) * tol\nerror = B @ B @ B_ILO**2 @ u - u\nassert norm2(error) < adjusted_tol" ],

This leads to the error: \"your wallet is not yet initialized, please make a transaction (sending ETH to yourself works) to initialize it.\" To support undeployed accounts, we propose directly verifying the signature using the public key (account address), bypassing the need to interact with the account's contract.**\n\n## Proposed Actions \uD83D\uDEE0️\n\nHere’s a checklist of actions to follow for resolving this issue:\n\n1. **Fork and Create Branch**:  \n   Fork the repository and create a new branch using the issue number:\n   \n```bash\n   git checkout -b fix-[issue-number]\n```\n\n2. **Implement Changes**:  \n- [ ] Create a utility function to verify Starknet signatures using public keys directly.\n- [ ] Integrate this function as a fallback when account is not yet deployed.\n- [ ] Detect if an account is deployed or not before calling `is_valid_signature`.\n- [ ] Add error handling and logging for both methods of verification.\n- [ ] Write unit tests for both deployed and undeployed account scenarios.\n\nExample snippet for direct signature verification:\n```python\ndef verify_signature(pubkey, message_hash, signature):\n    # Apply Starknet signature verification logic using elliptic curve math\n    return starknet_ec_verify(pubkey, message_hash, signature)\n```\n\n3. **Run Tests and Commit Changes**:  \n   Make sure your changes don't break existing functionality and commit with a clear message:\n   \n```bash\n   git commit -m \"Fix: Allow signature verification for undeployed Starknet accounts\"\n```\n\n## Required \uD83D\uDCCB\n\nTo keep our workflow smooth, please make sure you follow these guidelines:\n\n- **Assignment**: Don't create a pull request if you weren’t assigned to this issue.\n- **Timeframe**: Complete the task within **3 business days**.\n- **Closing the Issue**: In your PR description, close the issue by writing Close #[issue_id].\n- **Review Process**:\n  - Once you've submitted your PR, change the label to **\"ready for review\"**.\n  - If changes are requested, address them and then update the label back to **\"ready for review\"** once done.\n- **Testing**: Test your PR locally before pushing, and verify that tests and build are working after pushing.\n\nThank you for your contribution \uD83D\uDE4F\n\n⚠️ WARNING: Failure to follow the requirements above may result in being added to the OnlyDust blacklist, affecting your ability to receive future rewards.",

Especially when you have a long list of layers, its quite tedious to move the mouse cursor down without leaving the hover state. A transition or transition-delay would help, however I have been unable to implement this with pure css. \n\nI have found a workaround by triggering the collapse manually, however its causes other issues, like re-entering while not clearing older timeouts. Probably needs a debounce fn.\nhttps://plnkr.co/edit/WQyfFctUqs7mNdq9\n\nOn another note, a collapseDelay option would work really well to make it customizable.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nLayer control stays for 1-2 seconds after leaving hover state.\n\n### Current behavior\n\nLayer control disappears instantly after leaving hover state\n\n### Minimal example reproducing the issue\n\n_No response_\n\n### Environment\n\n- Leaflet version: 1.9.3\n- Browser (with version): Chrome\n- OS/Platform (with version): Mac/Windows latest\n",

      "description" : "## \uD83E\uDDF1 Devcontainer Setup for Unified Development Environment\n\n### \uD83C\uDFAF Goal\n\nProvide a consistent development environment via Devcontainers to reduce onboarding friction and tooling issues across contributors. This image will be used by all SCORE-related repositories (dozens in total), so it must be robust, reusable, and actively maintained.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Current Situation\n\nWe currently require a number of tools to be installed in addition to Bazel. This includes Python, Graphviz, Bazelisk, and shell autocompletion for Bazel. These tools are not always easy to install correctly across different systems, especially for new contributors.\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDE80 Solution\n\nImplement a reusable Devcontainer setup based on a Docker image that includes all required tools preinstalled. The image should be published to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) and referenced via `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` or `.devcontainer.json` in consuming repositories.\n\n**Target image name:** `ghcr.io/eclipse-score/devcontainer`\n\nThe base image should include:\n\n- Based on an extended Ubuntu image, quite certainly:\n  - `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/python:1.2-3.12`\n- Preinstalled tools:\n  - Python (needed for Bazel formatting bug workaround)\n  - Graphviz\n  - Bazelisk (with current bazel version pre-downloaded)\n  - Shell autocompletion for Bazel\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDEE0️ Concrete Tasks\n\n- [ ] Create a new GitHub repository (name: `eclipse-score/devcontainer`)\n- [ ] Create a `Dockerfile` that installs all required tools\n- [ ] Add GitHub Actions workflow to:\n  - Build the image\n  - Optional: Tag it with semantic version (e.g. `v1.0.0`) and `latest`\n  - Push to GHCR under `ghcr.io/eclipse-score/devcontainer`\n- [ ] Optional: Add typical metadata to the container\n- [ ] Use the image from GHCR in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` or `.devcontainer.json` in at least one repo (e.g. `score`)\n- [ ] Verify that all tools are functional inside the container\n- [ ] Optional: Add documentation (`README.md`) to `eclipse-score/devcontainer`\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDD04 Considered Alternatives\n\nSome tools could theoretically be installed via Bazel, but this was previously evaluated and rejected due to high implementation and maintenance cost. We chose to use system-level tools with clear documentation instead.\n\n---\n\n### \uD83E\uDDE0 Notes\n\n- The image will become the base for all development work across the SCORE ecosystem\n- Keep it generic, stable, and easy to extend.\n- This devcontainer will remain entirely optional, it's just meant to ease the pain of installing all the required tools.\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDCDA References\n\n- Example: [`eclipse-score/score/.devcontainer`](https://github.com/eclipse-score/score/tree/main/.devcontainer)\n- Docs: [Development Environment Setup](https://eclipse-score.github.io/score/main/contribute/development/development_environment.html#autocompletion-in-the-shell)\n",

However, that one is based on Debian instead of Ubuntu. A few of the tools have packages which are created for specific Ubuntu releases only.

This way users get a heads-up and have a chance to cancel before the payment goes through.\n\n### Describe the Use Case\n\nI add a recurring subscription payment (e.g. Spotify on the 15th of each month).\nI'd like the option to set a reminder X days before (e.g. 3 days before), so Dime sends me a notification like:\n\n“Your Spotify subscription is going to renew in 3 days — consider canceling if you don’t need it.”\n\nThis reduces the risk of forgetting to cancel and incurring charges for services I don’t use anymore.\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_",

Support basic entity types: PERSON, ORGANIZATION, LOCATION, DATE, EMAIL, PHONE\n2. Support keyword extraction using TF-IDF or similar algorithms\n3. Make this an optional feature with its own dependency group\n4. Results should include entity type, text, and position information\n5. Support custom entity patterns via regex\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n- Add optional dependency group:\n  ```toml\n  optional-dependencies.entity-extraction = [\n    \"gliner>=0.2.0\",  # State-of-the-art zero-shot NER, outperforms spaCy\n    \"keybert>=0.8.0\",  # Most accurate keyword extraction\n  ]\n  ```\n- **Library Choice Rationale**: \n  - Use GLiNER for NER based on 2024 benchmarks showing superior zero-shot performance and flexibility compared to spaCy\n  - Use KeyBERT for keyword extraction as it provides the highest accuracy among RAKE, YAKE, and KeyBERT\n- Add to `ExtractionConfig`:\n  ```python\n  extract_entities: bool = False\n  extract_keywords: bool = False\n  keyword_count: int = 10\n  custom_entity_patterns: dict[str, str] | None = None  # {\"INVOICE_ID\": r\"INV-\\d+\"}\n  ```\n- Add to `ExtractionResult`:\n  ```python\n  entities: list[Entity] | None = None\n  keywords: list[tuple[str, float]] | None = None  # (keyword, score)\n  ```\n- Create `kreuzberg/_entity_extraction.py` module\n- Define `Entity` dataclass with `type`, `text`, `start`, `end` fields\n\n**Testing Requirements:**\n- Test entity extraction on various document types\n- Test custom pattern matching\n- Test keyword extraction with different document lengths\n- Mock spacy models in unit tests\n- Test handling of missing dependencies\n- Verify performance impact is acceptable",

I don't know exactly.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. add proxy-cache plugin to a route\r\n2. run curl command with compression enabled\r\n   ```console\r\n   curl --compressed https://example.com/api/healthz -v --output -\r\n   ```\r\n4. run curl command without compression right afterwards\r\n   ```console\r\n   curl https://example.com/api/healthz -v --output -\r\n   ```\r\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\nThis is my Kubernetes resource:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\napiVersion: configuration.konghq.com/v1\r\nkind: KongPlugin\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: my-cache-1min\r\n  namespace: my-api-v4\r\nconfig:\r\n  cache_ttl: 60\r\n  content_type:\r\n    - text/plain\r\n    - application/json\r\n    - application/json; charset=utf-8\r\n  request_method:\r\n    - GET\r\n    - HEAD\r\n  response_code:\r\n    - 200\r\n  ignore_uri_case: true\r\n  strategy: memory\r\nplugin: proxy-cache\r\n```",

You can try the following methods to deal with this issue:\n\n1. Reduce the training batch size `per_device_train_batch_size: 1`\n2. Replace compute kernels `enable_liger_kernel: true` and `use_unsloth_gc: true`\n3. Reduce the maximum sequence length `cutoff_len: 512`\n4. Use DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 or FSDP to partition model weights on multiple devices or use CPU offloading\n5. Set `quantization_bit: 4` to quantize model parameters (only compatible with LoRA tuning)\n6. Use the paged optimizer `optim: paged_adamw_8bit`\n\n模型训练时显存溢出，通常是由于当前某个设备的剩余显存不足以完成计算任务。可尝试下述方法解决：\n\n1. 降低批处理大小 `per_device_train_batch_size: 1`\n2. 替换模型算子 `enable_liger_kernel: true` 和 `use_unsloth_gc: true`\n3. 降低最大序列长度 `cutoff_len: 512`\n4. 使用 DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 或 FSDP 将模型权重拆分到多个设备或使用 CPU Offloading\n5. 设置 `quantization_bit: 4` 量化模型参数（仅限于 LoRA 方法）\n6. 使用分页低精度优化器 `optim: paged_adamw_8bit`\n\n----\n\n### Unsatisfying fine-tuning results / 微调效果无法令人满意\n\nUnsatisfying fine-tuning results are usually due to insufficient training samples, leading to underfitting. You can try the following methods to deal with this issue:\n\n1. Increase the size of the training dataset\n2. Increase the number of epochs `num_train_epochs: 5.0` or steps `max_steps: 1000`\n3. Use a larger learning rate `learning_rate: 2.0e-4`\n4. Use different fine-tuning method `finetuning_type: freeze` or `finetuning_type: full`\n\n微调效果较差，通常是由于训练样本过少，导致模型欠拟合。可尝试下述方法解决：\n\n1. 增加训练数据集的大小\n2. 提高训练轮数 `num_train_epochs: 5.0` 或步数 `max_steps: 1000`\n3. 增大学习率 `learning_rate: 2.0e-4`\n4. 使用不同的微调方法 `finetuning_type: freeze` 或 `finetuning_type: full`\n\n----\n\n### Corrupted or repeated model responses / 胡乱或重复的模型回答\n\nIf this issue occurs before training, it is usually due to using an unaligned (base) model or a mismatched `template`. Please ensure an aligned (instruct/chat) model and correct `template` are used.\nIf this issue occurs after training, please check if the `template` used for training and inference is consistent. And do not forget to check if the overfitting appeared. You can try decreasing the number of epochs `num_train_epochs` and learning rate `learning_rate` to deal with the overfitting issue.\n\n若该问题发生在训练之前，通常是由于使用了未经对齐（base）的模型或不恰当的模板 `template`，请保证使用对齐后（instruct/chat）的模型和正确的模板 `template`。\n若该问题发生在训练之后，请检查训练和推理使用的模板 `template` 是否一致，同时检查是否发生了过拟合。如果发生了过拟合，请减小训练轮数 `num_train_epochs` 和学习率 `learning_rate`。\n\n----\n\n### Training hangs / 训练进程卡住\n\nIf distributed training was not enabled, please use the following command to check if the CUDA version of PyTorch is installed correctly:\n\n如果没有使用分布式训练，请使用下述命令检查 CUDA 版本的 PyTorch 是否被正确安装：\n\n```bash\npython -c \"import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())\"\n```\n\nIf distributed training was enabled, try setting the environment variable `export NCCL_P2P_LEVEL=NVL`.\n\n如果使用了分布式训练，请尝试设置环境变量 `export NCCL_P2P_LEVEL=NVL`。\n\n----\n\n### LLaMA Board cannot display datasets / LLaMA Board 无法显示数据集\n\nPlease ensure that the working directory when launching the LLaMA Board is the same as the LLaMA-Factory directory.\n\n请确保启动 LLaMA Board 时的工作目录与 LLaMA-Factory 主目录一致。\n\n----\n\n### How to shard model weights on multiple devices / 如何模型权重拆分到多个设备上\n\nDuring the training phase, please refer to the [examples](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory/blob/main/examples/README.md#supervised-fine-tuning-with-deepspeed-zero-3-weight-sharding) about how to use the DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 (recommended) or FSDP.\nDuring the inference phase, please use vLLM to enable the tensor parallelism: [examples](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory/tree/main/examples#inferring-lora-fine-tuned-models).\n\n在训练阶段，请参考 [examples](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory/blob/main/examples/README_zh.md#%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8-deepspeed-zero-3-%E5%B9%B3%E5%9D%87%E5%88%86%E9%85%8D%E6%98%BE%E5%AD%98) 使用 DeepSpeed ZeRO-3（推荐）或 FSDP。\n在推理阶段，请使用 vLLM 来开启张量并行：[examples](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory/blob/main/examples/README_zh.md#%E6%8E%A8%E7%90%86-lora-%E6%A8%A1%E5%9E%8B).\n\n----\n\n### How to use ORPO or SimPO / 如何使用 ORPO 或 SimPO\n\nModify the `pref_loss` in [example script](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory/blob/main/examples/train_lora/llama3_lora_dpo.yaml) to `orpo` or `simpo`.\n\n将[示例脚本](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory/blob/main/examples/train_lora/llama3_lora_dpo.yaml) 中的 `pref_loss` 改为 `orpo` 或 `simpo`。\n\n----\n\n### How to debug with VSCode / 如何用 VSCode 调试程序\n\nSee #5337\n\n----\n\n### Why the number of examples is small in pre-training / 为什么预训练样本数比实际的少\n\nWe automatically use packing in pre-training, where we concatenate multiple samples into one sequence, so the number of examples displayed is less than the actual number.\n\n我们在预训练时候自动使用了 Packing，将多个样本打包成一条序列，因此显示的样本数量会比实际的少。\n\n----\n\n### Will the training data be shuffled / 训练数据是否会被打乱\n\nLLaMA-Factory will randomly shuffle the training data by default. You can use `disable_shuffling` to turn off the shuffling.\n\nLLaMA-Factory 默认会随机打乱训练数据，可使用 `disable_shuffling` 关闭打乱。\n\n----\n\n### How to enable streaming / 如何启用流式数据读取\n\nWe recommend shuffling the dataset before training if you want to use streaming. Add the following arguments to your yaml file.\n\n如果您希望使用流式数据读取，请在训练前手动打乱数据。将下面的参数添加到 YAML 文件中。\n\n```yaml\nbuffer_size: 128\npreprocessing_batch_size: 128\nstreaming: true\naccelerator_config:\n  dispatch_batches: false\n```\n\n----\n\n### How to resolve `Processor was not found` / 如何解决 `Processor was not found`\n\nPlease run the following code and paste the full error log to Issue.\n\n请运行下面的代码并粘贴完整报错信息到 Issue。\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoProcessor\nprocessor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(\"path-to-your-model\")\n```\n\n----\n\n> [!TIP]\n> If the problems still exist with the **latest** code, please create an issue.\n> 若使用**最新的**代码仍然无法解决问题，请创建一个 issue。\n",

Click any \"First name\" cell once without activating edit mode\n3. Press any key, app crashes with error `Cannot destructure property 'value' of 'params.props' as it is undefined.`\n\nNote that if you set `age` column's `preProcessEditCellProps` to just return `return params;`, it still crashes but now you get internal datagrid error:\n```ts\nCannot read properties of undefined (reading 'value')\n    at eval (https://2rmfqs.csb.app/node_modules/\nmui/x-data-grid/esm/hooks/features/editing/useGridRowEditing.js:374:44\n```\n\n\n### Current behavior\n\nIf column definition has\n1. `preProcessEditCellProps` defined\n2. `editable: true`\n\nand column cell is set as non-editable by DataGrid prop `isCellEditable` returning `false` for that field, `preProcessEditCellProps` is still called if user edits any cell by starting typing on cell before edit mode is activated.\n\nThis results in `params.props` being undefined (in `preProcessEditCellProps`) and causes app to crash.\n\nThis is extension of recently fixed bug https://github.com/mui/mui-x/issues/17298 \n\n### Expected behavior\n\n`preProcessEditCellProps` should not be called for the column if the cell in question is disabled via DataGrid's `isCellEditable` prop, even if column itself has `editable: true` set (I believe cell editability should have higher priority than column editability)\n\n### Context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Your environment\n\n<details>\n  <summary><code>npx @mui/envinfo</code></summary>\n\n```\n System:\n    OS: macOS 15.4.1\n  Binaries:\n    Node: 20.18.1 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v20.18.1/bin/node\n    npm: 10.8.2 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v20.18.1/bin/npm\n    pnpm: 10.10.0 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v20.18.1/bin/pnpm\n  Browsers:\n    Chrome: 136.0.7103.93\n    Edge: 136.0.3240.64\n    Safari: 18.4\n  npmPackages:\n    @emotion/react: ^11.13.3 => 11.13.3 \n    @emotion/styled: ^11.11.0 => 11.11.0 \n    @mui/core-downloads-tracker:  5.16.14 \n    @mui/icons-material: ^5.16.4 => 5.16.4 \n    @mui/material: ^5.16.14 => 5.16.14 \n    @mui/private-theming:  5.16.14 \n    @mui/styled-engine:  5.16.14 \n    @mui/system:  5.16.14 \n    @mui/types:  7.2.16 \n    @mui/utils:  5.16.14 \n    @mui/x-charts:  7.23.0 \n    @mui/x-charts-pro: ^7.23.0 => 7.23.0 \n    @mui/x-charts-vendor:  7.20.0 \n    @mui/x-data-grid:  7.29.3 \n    @mui/x-data-grid-premium: ^7.29.3 => 7.29.3 \n    @mui/x-data-grid-pro:  7.29.3 \n    @mui/x-date-pickers: ^7.28.0 => 7.28.0 \n    @mui/x-internals:  7.21.0 \n    @mui/x-license: ^7.26.0 => 7.29.1 \n    @mui/x-tree-view: ^7.22.1 => 7.22.1 \n    @types/react: ^17.0.75 => 17.0.76 \n    react: ^18.2.0 => 18.2.0 \n    react-dom: ^18.2.0 => 18.2.0 \n    styled-components: ^5.3.9 => 5.3.9 \n    typescript: ^5.7.3 => 5.7.3 \n```\n</details>\n\n\n\n**Search keywords**: datagrid preprocessEditCellProps isCellEditable",

The site already includes the necessary scripts and logic to load and initialize Mermaid.js when this config is present [source](https://github.com/apache/incubator-hugegraph-doc/blob/48ff6f261c634e8d8ae9c4fac9e21524f67424b5/themes/docsy/layouts/partials/scripts.html).\n\nFor image issues: make sure all images referenced in documentation are stored locally (for example, in the `static/` directory) rather than using remote URLs, which can break or be blocked [source](https://github.com/apache/incubator-hugegraph-doc/blob/48ff6f261c634e8d8ae9c4fac9e21524f67424b5/config.toml). Hosting all third-party resources (like Mermaid.js, images, fonts) locally also helps avoid CSP and privacy policy issues [source](https://github.com/apache/incubator-hugegraph-doc/issues/388).\n\nAfter updating the configuration and image locations, rebuild the site and the diagrams/images should render as expected.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

The theme logic in this repo only loads Mermaid scripts if `.Site.Params.mermaid.enable` is set, so the specific `var params = null` TypeError cannot occur here. Your Mermaid diagrams are not rendering because the required config is missing, not due to the upstream bug.\n\nTo fix Mermaid rendering, add this to your `config.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[params.mermaid]\nenable = true\n\n[markup]\n  [markup.highlight]\n    guessSyntax = false\n```\n\nThis will enable Mermaid support and ensure diagrams render as expected.

I guess in theory if we're really careful about the lookup logic (and the KVStore is async) we could do the loading in parallel (though its still a few more requests) but we'd still have to wait on compaction (without a background-compaction task running, which would require a generic `spawn` method...). Seems much easier to just check the length and skip some code for the common case :)", "If I understand it correctly, this is special casing for channels at the beginning of their life and when they grow, the node will switch over to persisting updates and compaction anyway?\n\nTo me it isn't quite clear if this is really worth it. If the hit is significant, it is also a problem when the channel has outgrown the 'small' stage anyway?", "> If I understand it correctly, this is special casing for channels at the beginning of their life and when they grow, the node will switch over to persisting updates and compaction anyway?\n\nYes.\n\n> To me it isn't quite clear if this is really worth it. If the hit is significant, it is also a problem when the channel has outgrown the 'small' stage anyway?\n\nIts more a recognition of two very different cases - if you're running an \"edge node\" that is just a wallet making occasional payments, then you're likely to never hit the \"large\" stage, and thus avoiding the compaction overhead is a really nice optimization. If you're a larger node that is forwarding/processing many payments, you're very likely to hit the \"large\" stage and the compaction penalty is worth it to avoid the writes.", "At what size would the \"large\" stage be entered then typically and how many htlcs/channel updates is that? A channel monitor of a few kb, that doesn't sound like all that many updates?", "Yea, dunno, we'd have to figure that out. I imagine most mobile nodes probably make in the 100s to low 1000s of payments in their entire lifetime, probably fewer on a single channel once you consider splicing and the like. 10KiB or whatever should be plenty for 100 or 250 payments.", "> Its more a recognition of two very different cases\n\nIt sounds like if you wanted to make this automatic, the metric you'd really want to evaluate to switch this behavior isn't so much monitor size, as one of these:\n\n  - Frequency of updates to the channel\n  - Latency of updates to the channel (more difficult)\n\nThe monitor size is a decent reflection of the _number_ of updates to the channel[1], but with no perception of time it's impossible to evaluate whether it's being stored by a tenured edge node, or a routing node. I think if you took time into account, perhaps by using the block delta between the funding tx and chain tip to estimate update frequency, you could make a more informed assessment.\n\nHowever, I worry that automating the behavior selection is not really following the \"principle of least astonishment.\" \n\nI would think that routing nodes rarely move to the edge, and edge nodes rarely become routing nodes (more often, a routing node starts small and may appear like an edge). And furthermore, I know what my node is likely to be; especially if I'm a Lightning developer and managing this on behalf of users, such as in a mobile wallet.\n\nFor that matter, varying the behavior _per channel_ seems to make node persistence more difficult to reason about. Different channels could persist different ways on my node, depending on a size threshold. Which means they can change without me doing anything. I would think that if the reason for variation is the use case, then one behavior is correct for all channels stored by the node.\n\nIn that light, I'd just leave this a configurable behavior, which I think it is now.\n\n[1] I recognize that size is being used here to evaluate the storage write size, not the number of updates. But I think that is why the discussion is unclear. Compared to update count/frequency, it's much harder to know the storage configuration of a given node, and what the throughput/latency tradeoff is like.", "I think the intent of the proposed change is to optimize for the edge-node case with remote storage. Even an edge node may make enough payments to get a monitor up to 10s of KiB in size, at which point network-level effects like TCP slowstart may dominate the actual network latency. For a \"power-user\" edge node, we really want to use the `MonitorUpdatingPersister`, but paying the extra RTT cost of cleanup on load for every edge node is not a great tradeoff either.\n\nFor a routing node, it still seems to me like a size-based threshold may be something they want, purely as it (very marginally) reduces IO throughput for under-utilized or new channels. Writing out updates (padded to 4KiB or more depending on the storage medium) and then consolidating when the whole monitor is only a few KiB isn't really the right tradeoff no matter what. Of course a routing node is expected to surpass the threshold very quickly, so it shouldn't really make a substantial difference, but it seems strictly better to write out full updates in this case than not.\n\nIndeed, this does lead to a bit of behavior shift, but I think the important metrics wouldn't change - first of all, if you happened to look at storage right after compaction, the stored contents would be identical to a full monitor persistence so I wouldn't really say that this materially changes the way that logic would interact with the stored data (you already have to handle the case of having no in-flight updates!). It also shouldn't materially change the IO throughput or write count for any node, just a fairly marginal strict reduction for routing nodes with fresh channels.", "> At what size would the \"large\" stage be entered then typically and how many htlcs/channel updates is that? A channel monitor of a few kb, that doesn't sound like all that many updates?\n\nFor our probing node running ldk-node with network storage (EFS), at around 20,000 updates over the single channel the average probe duration starts to increase substantially. p75 starts to creep up after about 3,000.", "Do y'all have any further thoughts here, @domZippilli or @amackillop?", "> Do y'all have any further thoughts here, [@domZippilli](https://github.com/domZippilli) or [@amackillop](https://github.com/amackillop)?\n\nI see in the PR it's configurable. I think as long as that's the case, developers who don't want the variation in behavior can set the minimum size to `0`.\n\neta: Also, I'm still not sure I like that it varies across channels, rather than a consistent behavior on a node.", "Perhaps wait for developers who do want/need the variation in behavior to show up and only then implement? I think the \"principle of least astonishment\" is worth considering.", "> Perhaps wait for developers who do want/need the variation in behavior to show up and only then implement? I think the \"principle of least astonishment\" is worth considering.\n\nWell, we likely do want to enable MUP in LDK Node, especially when persisting vs. remote storage/VSS. The question is whether it's preferable to *always* use MUP, even for very small monitors. I'd be reluctant to expose a setting in LDK Node for this, as I don't think our users would have better insight into which way to go than we do.", "> Perhaps wait for developers who do want/need the variation in behavior to show up and only then implement? I think the \"principle of least astonishment\" is worth considering.\n\nFWIW I think the \"principle of least astonishment\" is served perfectly fine by changing the MUP to persist full monitors when they're small - there's no material difference in user-visible behavior between persisting full monitors and small ones, except the performance changes (i.e. we definitely can't persist full monitors that are huge). When persisting small monitors, its no difference from hitting the cleanup ID where we delete the updates anyway. Because of this I still think this change is *strictly better* than the current version.", ">there's no material difference in user-visible behavior between persisting full monitors and small ones\n\nThat's clear. I was thinking of least astonishment in reasoning about and resolving potential problems. Basically what @domZippilli mentions in https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/3770#issuecomment-2984271612.\n\nIn this case, I would define 'strictly better' as a performance increase without an increase in complexity." ],

When the API key is empty, the header becomes `Authorization: Basic ` or `Authorization: Bearer `, which is considered an illegal header value by the HTTP library and causes the execution to fail ([source](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/blob/bb955806e042517831b232948c3f9f7150ac5fb6/api/core/workflow/nodes/http_request/executor.py)). The code only checks that the API key field exists, not that it contains a non-empty value.\n\nAs a workaround, avoid configuring HTTPRequest nodes with empty API keys for these auth types. If your workflow might have an empty key, consider adding logic to skip the HTTPRequest node or switch to \"no-auth\" when the key is empty. There’s currently no built-in validation or warning for this in Dify, so it’s a systemic issue, not a new regression.\n\nNo official documentation or existing issues address this yet. It would be helpful for the platform to add validation or user warnings for empty API keys in future releases.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

      "description" : "### Apache Airflow version\n\n3.0.2\n\n### If \"Other Airflow 2 version\" selected, which one?\n\n_No response_\n\n### What happened?\n\nI opened the Trigger Dag form in the Airflow 3 UI and filled in parameters under the section “Run Parameters” (or under “Advanced Options → Configuration JSON”). \n\nWhen I submit the form to backfill a historical date range, the DAG run is created and executes, but the parameters I entered are not actually passed into the tasks. Inside the task, references like {{ params.my_param }} or accessing context[\"params\"][\"my_param\"] remain unset. \n\nAlthough the UI shows the parameters form, these values never make it into the task context. \n\n### What you think should happen instead?\n\nWhen I trigger a backfill from the Airflow 3 UI and enter parameters in the Run Parameters or Advanced Options → Configuration JSON, these values should be passed to each DAG run created during the backfill.\n\nInside the DAG, I should be able to access them using:\n\t•\t{{ params.my_param }} in templates\n\t•\tcontext[\"params\"][\"my_param\"] in Python code\n\nThis is how it works when triggering a single DAG run from the UI, so the behavior should be the same for backfills. The parameters entered in the UI should override the defaults defined in the DAG and be available in all backfilled runs.\n\n### How to reproduce\n\n1.\tCreate the following DAG:\n\n```\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom airflow.decorators import dag, task\nfrom airflow.models.param import Param, ParamsDict\n\n@task\ndef test_backfill_with_params(params: ParamsDict):\n    assert params.get(\"id\") is not None\n\n@dag(\n    dag_id='test_backfill',\n    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),\n    schedule='@daily',\n    catchup=False,\n    default_args={'owner': 'Gery', 'retries': 0},\n    params={\n        \"id\": Param(default=None, title=\"My id\", description=\"My id\", type=[\"null\", \"string\"]),\n    }\n)\ndef test_backfill_dag():\n    test_backfill_with_params()\n\ntest_backfill_dag()\n```\n\n2.\tGo to the Airflow 3 UI.\n3.\tOpen the Backfill modal for the test_backfill DAG.\n4.\tSet a date range (e.g., start and end: 2025-06-01 00:00 and 2025-06-02 00:00).\n5.\tIn the Run Parameters section, set id = \"1234\".\n6.\tTrigger the backfill.\n\nExpected: The DAG run(s) should pass \"id\": \"1234\" to the task, and the assertion should pass.\nActual: The parameter is not passed, and the task fails due to params.get(\"id\") being None.\n\n### Operating System\n\nMac OS 14.6 (23G80)\n\n### Versions of Apache Airflow Providers\n\nNo providers\n\n### Deployment\n\nDocker-Compose\n\n### Deployment details\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Are you willing to submit PR?\n\n- [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n",

However, if you look at all this in General keep in mind that we also have also such scenarios on purpose:\n```\ncontext.requireOnline(purpose, false);\ntry {\n  doSomethingWithNetwork();\n} catch (IOException e) {\n  if (isOfflineMode()) {\n    return false;\n  }\n  throw e;\n}\n```\n\nThe idea of this pattern is that we do not have to do too many pointless online requests (flooding github.com) and prevent that if github.com would be done for whatever reason that this blocks all other network operations of IDEasy.", "While I was looking through the usages of `isOnline()`, I found this method inside `GitContextImpl.java`:\n\n\n```\n  private void handleErrors(Path targetRepository, ProcessResult result) {\n    if (!result.isSuccessful()) {\n      String message = \"Failed to update git repository at \" + targetRepository;\n      if (this.context.isOffline()) {\n        this.context.warning(message);\n        this.context.interaction(\"Continuing as we are in offline mode - results may be outdated!\");\n      } else {\n        this.context.error(message);\n        if (this.context.isOnline()) {\n          this.context.error(\"See above error for details.

Do you want to continue anyways?\");\n      }\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nI am a little bit confused about the functionality: in the `if` it says  `if (this.context.isOffline())` which means `if (!isOnline() || isOfflineMode())` but then in the interaction underneath, it says `\"Continuing as we are in offline mode - results may be outdated!\"` which does not have to be true - we could also be actually offline and not just in offline mode.\n\nThen inside the `else` we check `if (this.context.isOnline())` and then also do an `else` here. This `else` will never be used, as inside this Block `isOnline() && !isOfflineMode()` is true.\n\n@hohwille  Should this method be refactored?" ],

The package provides:\n- RFC 9457-compliant error responses: Ensures machine-readable error details in HTTP responses.\n- Built-in HTTP error types: Quickly create common HTTP errors like 404, 500, etc.\n- Fastify integration: Automatically handles errors and formats responses seamlessly.\n- TypeScript support: Includes type definitions for better development experience.\n\n**Example usage**:\n```typescript\nimport Fastify from 'fastify';\nimport { fastifyProblemDetails } from '@yeliex/fastify-problem-details';\n\nconst app = Fastify();\napp.register(fastifyProblemDetails);\n\napp.get('/', async (request, reply) => {\n    // or any other error instances\n    throw new app.httpErrors.NotFound('Resource not found');\n});\n\napp.listen({ port: 3000 });\n```\n\n*Visit [readme](https://github.com/yeliex/fastify-problem-details) for more usage*\n\n**Why not implement Problem Details directly in fastify-error**\nProblem Details, as defined by RFC 9457 is standardized format for HTTP API error responses, but `fastify-error` primarily focused on error creation and management within Fastify applications.\n\nImplementing Problem Details directly within fastify-error would introduce unnecessary complexity and coupling, making it less modular and harder to maintain. Instead, Problem Details is better suited as an external package, allowing developers to integrate it flexibly into their projects as another option to response errors." ],

Also, if the nodetool API is already ambgious (what does the \"a:b\" the user passed mean?) there is no way that additional encoding can fix it.\r\n\r\nIf you change anything in this area, please don't forget to add tests.", "From the api standpoint what I had in mind is to pass `key=a%3Ab` if the non-composite key (or one of its components) contains `:`.\r\nThe user can pass that to nodetool as well.\r\n\r\nThat said, allowing passing multiple components as request parameters is possible too, though with the current interface it is not intuitive to assume that the multiple key parameters indicate multiple components of a composite key rather than multiple keys, if the API supported returning the natural endpoints for multiple keys.\r\n\r\nNote that `%3A` is supported for `keyspace:table` \"tuples\" when passed as a single parameter or as a comma-separated list of `keyspace:table`, to support keyspace or table names containing `:`.", "> From the api standpoint what I had in mind is to pass `key=a%3Ab` if the non-composite key (or one of its components) contains `:`. The user can pass that to nodetool as well.\r\n\r\n`key=a%3Ab` is the url-encoded form of setting key to `a:b`. But now that Scylla receives it, how does it know if this was intended to be a string key `a:b` or two components?\r\n\r\nMaybe you were thinking of encoding **twice**? If that's the case, the first layer of encoding doesn't need to be URL encoding. Just the outer layer of encoding must be.\r\n\r\nAre you sure about what you said about `keyspace:table` allowing real \":\"? Last time I checked, I found that at least in one context, you are only allowed to have colons in the table name, not keyspace name (e.g., in Alternator GSI), and what happens is simply that Scylla splits only on the first colon, so `xyz:abc:qwe` means that `xyz` is the keyspace, `abc:qwe` is the table.

Test in test/rest_api that checks the REST API request in two cases: single-partition-key-column-and-colon-in-the-key and two-partition-key-column-and-colon-used-as-separator. Perhaps we already have a test for the latter case?\n2. Test in dtest or test/nodetool (I'm not up to date on what's right) that checks the nodetool command, not rest api.

Some ideas raised in this issue required even more explicit changes to nodetool that would need to be tested.\n\nPlease also see my recommendation in https://github.com/scylladb/scylladb/pull/24720 to improve the commit message to say exactly what we're fixing and what we aren't, and also consider which documentation we need to update to explain the situation with the colon.\n\n> \n> [@denesb](https://github.com/denesb) should review\n\n" ],

I am a beginner, so please excuse any mistakes or oversights!\r\n\r\n\r\n", "@spranav1205 Hi, thanks for looking into this !\r\n\r\nNowadays Python's standard lib is richer and I think we can go with a simpler desgin that the one that was choosen at the time for `time_support` and `quantity_support`.\r\nIn particular, for this specific task of combining existing context managers, I think we should use (or take inspiration from) [`contextlib.ExitStack`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.ExitStack).", "We can use the following approach to combine `quantity_support` and `time_support` using a function, without the need for a class:\r\n\r\n    @contextmanager\r\n    def astro_support():\r\n     \r\n        q = quantity_support()\r\n        t = time_support()\r\n        \r\n        try:\r\n            q.__enter__()\r\n            t.__enter__()\r\n            yield  \r\n        finally:\r\n            q.__exit__()\r\n            t.__exit__()\r\n\r\nWith this implementation, astro_support can be used as a context manager with the `with` statement, but it can't be used independently like` quantity_support()` or `time_support()`.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we can implement `astro_support` as a class, which can act both as a context manager (with `with`) and as a decorator for functions. This would look something like:\r\n\r\n    class astro_support(ContextDecorator):\r\n              def __init__(self):\r\n                  # Call both quantity and time support functions and assign them to a class variable, e.g., self.q_support\r\n                 \r\n              def __enter__(self):\r\n                  # Enter both quantity and time support context\r\n                  \r\n              def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):\r\n                  # Exit both quantity and time support context\r\n                  \r\nWould you like me to implement either of these? Or should we explore some other method?\r\n", "Actually the `contextlib.contexmanager` implementation also allows using it as a decorator\r\n\r\nquoting from https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.contextmanager\r\n> [contextmanager()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.contextmanager) uses [ContextDecorator](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.ContextDecorator) so the context managers it creates can be used as decorators as well as in [with](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#with) statements. When used as a decorator, a new generator instance is implicitly created on each function call (this allows the otherwise “one-shot” context managers created by [contextmanager()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.contextmanager) to meet the requirement that context managers support multiple invocations in order to be used as decorators).\r\n\r\nSo my preference is to go with the first approach as it's simpler. Note that it is generally not recommended to call so-called dunder[^1] methods like `__enter__` and `__exit__` directly, so I would favor something like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom contextlib import contextmanager, ExitStack\r\n\r\n@contextmanager\r\ndef astro_support():\r\n    with ExitStack() as stack:\r\n        stack.enter_context(quantity_support())\r\n        stack.enter_context(time_support())\r\n        yield\r\n```\r\n\r\n[^1]: \"dunder\" is short for \"double underscore\" and is a common way to refer to Python's protocols that are named with two leading and two trailing underscores", "Yes, this works perfectly. I have opened a PR #17575. I will update the changelog and add a test case shortly!", "Hi @astropy/core team \uD83D\uDC4B\nI'd love to help close out issue #8860 (“enable both quantity_support and time_support in one go”). I saw PR #17979 is already addressing this great start!\nI can help with:\n\nAdding unit tests (both context manager and decorator use cases)\nUpdating the visualization documentation\nWould it be helpful if I take this on next?" ],

      "description" : "## Describe the bug\r\n\r\nThe [Icinga 2 API Event Stream documentation](https://icinga.com/docs/icinga-2/latest/doc/12-icinga2-api/#event-streams) states that the required `queue` parameter used to subscribe to the Event Stream must have an \"[u]nique queue name [and] [m]ultiple HTTP clients can use the same queue as long as they use the same event types and filter\".\r\n\r\nHowever, currently there is no functionality bound to the `queue` parameter next to a check for its presence.\r\nhttps://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/blob/2c9117b4f71e00b2072e7dbe6c4ea4e48c882a87/lib/remote/eventshandler.cpp#L81-L86\r\n\r\nIt seems like it's logic was removed in #7088, especially 81713d0509e5c686a4d038a237f367d438703120. Within this PR, the change regarding `queue` was [noted](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/pull/7088#issuecomment-480358802), but no further decisions were made.\r\n\r\n## To Reproduce\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI would expect the documentation to match the actual logic.\r\n\r\nAs I recently started using the Event Stream API a lot, I relied on the documented behavior, but, fortunately, did not ran in any errors - or at least non I know of. Thus, if the uniqueness constraint is not enforced anyway, maybe drop the whole parameter or change the code again to match the documented restrictions. As I myself do not know Icinga 2's internal well enough, I cannot say what would be best.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n## Your Environment\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nn/a",

You can find the list of necessary connectors and configuration guidance here: [DLP Configuration – Copilot Studio Kit](https://github.com/microsoft/Power-CAT-Copilot-Studio-Kit/blob/main/TECHDETAILS.md#connectors-used-for-dlp-configuration-purposes)\n\n- Confirm Prerequisites\nBefore reinstalling, please double-check that all prerequisites are met as outlined in the documentation to ensure a smooth setup.", "Thanks for your answer. However even after trying all those steps, I end up with the same result. I can confirm that the DLP configuration allows all types of connectors and that all the prerequisities are checked." ],
