Open a sketch in the web editor.\n2. Select the language other than english.\n3. Go to Help section and click on About.",

Go through each file in `./src/gui/src/UI`\r\n2. For each human-readable string found:\r\n   - Create a unique, descriptive key for the string\r\n   - Replace the string with `i18n(key)`\r\n   - Add the key-value pair to `./src/gui/src/i18n/translations/en.js`\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```javascript\r\n<button>Submit</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```javascript\r\n<button>{i18n('submit')}</button>\r\n```\r\nIn `./src/gui/src/i18n/translations/en.js`:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst en = {\r\n    name: \"English\",\r\n    english_name: \"English\",\r\n    code: \"en\",\r\n    dictionary: {\r\n        // ... existing translations\r\n        'submit_button_text': 'Submit',\r\n        // ... existing translations\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Additional Notes\r\n\r\n- Ensure keys are descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention\r\n- Be cautious with dynamic text or text that includes variables\r\n- Consider context when creating keys to avoid potential conflicts\r\n\r\n## Definition of Done\r\n\r\n- All human-readable text in files under `./src/gui/src/UI` is replaced with `i18n(key)` calls.\r\n- All new keys are added to `./src/gui/src/i18n/translations/en.js` with correct English translations.\r\n- The application builds without errors and all UI elements display correctly.",

      "comments" : [ "+1 - we just ran into a problem related the fleet integrations when upgrading our entire stack from 8.15 -> 8.18\n\nI think because of the \"auto update\", the apm server integration got upgraded to 8.18 automatically, this broke our terraform state because it couldn't find the apm server integration 8.15.\n\nWe had to manipulate state to remove it, then found out that `terrafom import` is not supported for this resource type, so we had to manually go in kibana and delete the integration, so then terraform was able to proceed and create it.\n\nThis is really cumbersome\nIt's the first time we've ran into this because it's the first upgrade after we introduced terraform to manage our elastic stack.\n", "Plus, I'm wondering if it's even worth to have the integrations controlled by terraform, because when you bump the version, terraform tries to remove the integration and add a new one, but this fails because you cannot remove integrations that have a policy assigned to it.\n\nThis really breaks the whole point of automating this.\nAs a paying customer, I'm really disappointed that the terraform provider just seem like an afterthought, and there is really no other good alternative to maintain a bunch of elastic/kibana internal resources through IaC ", "It is a reasonable question to be asked, if it does make sense to manage the fleet integrations with Terraform. We do it for one of our setups since roughly 9 months and there are some challenges attached to it. The main reason we still do it is, that it helps us to keep everything under control between the 3 deployments (dev, test, prod).\n\nWhat we find challenging is to perform updates of the fleet integrations. We normally execute the update manually on dev and then \"backport\" the changes to Terraform by analyzing the differences in the execution plan. The main challenge there is rooted in the fact, that some of the properties (for example `vars`, if I recall correctly) are marked as sensitive in Terraform and therefore Terraform refuses to show the differences even if the property might not contain any sensitive value for some of the fleet integrations (where others actually do store sensitive values in this property). Since analyzing the differences in the JSON output of the Terraform plan became very painful (especially, since the values are JSON in JSON), we even built our own tool to assist with this (https://github.com/breml/tfreveal).\n\nThe bottom line is, that with the use of fleet integrations one faces the challange, that there are two different systems (Terraform and the install/update mechanism of Fleet), which change the state and therefore there is always drift, that one needs to handle in Terraform. Sofar we made it work, but compared with other systems, that we manage with Terraform, this is for sure one of the more painful ones." ],

This is because we did not migrate the many convenient, abstracted, and commonly used access control test methods from `ui/webapi/BaseActionTest.java` to `sqlui/webapi/BaseActionTest.java`.\n\nAfter merging #13254, all of the access control test methods in `BaseActionTest.java` have been migrated. Hence, this issue aims to refactor the unit test access controls to use these convenient test methods.\n\n## Progress\nThe progress for this refactoring can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IcB-viJMrIOknYoBYasBuRBK9qnwY0-doEK4_Eb24IA/edit?gid=0#gid=0). I (the author) will update it when completed PRs are merged proactively.\n\n## Steps to Contribute\n\n1. Choose test(s) to work on in the above Google Sheets link\n2. Check that no on else have claimed the test cases to work on within the last 2 weeks, or that it has been completed by follow up PRs (but not updated in the sheets)\n3.

The trade-off being higher confidence we have no flakes.\n\nI  think we can keep local test runs (by default) to continue to run with `-count=1` (the default) ie. `make unit-test`. And so no changes for local dev.\n\nBut given the frequency of flakey test runs, I do think it is worth it to run CI with `-count=2`. It will slow CI down, but flakey/buggy tests will likely fail checks. And if we have access to bigger build workers(?), I think that would help reduce the time (bigger workers = more CPUs = more tests running in parallel).\n\n(ill put this comment on https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/31013#pullrequestreview-2975837738 as well)\n\nThe final option would be to only run with a higher count upon merging to main.

Initially, we kept the text input for the LAM encoder in stage 2 but found that dropping it performs better. You can try both designs in your own setting to see which one works best.", "I'm very curious about this issue as well. \n- The 1st stage is called **task-irrelevant** while task instructions are provided. \n- The 2nd stage is called **task-centric** while task information is not given.\nWhat are the reasons behind those terminologies?", "Thanks for bringing this up! During the first stage of training, the strong information bottleneck created by the VQ-VAE codebook forces the learned latent actions to capture only the information not inferable from task instructions—resulting in task-irrelevant latent actions.\n\nIn the second stage, with these task-irrelevant latents frozen, the newly initialized latent actions are trained to replace the role of language, allowing them to learn task-centric dynamics.\n\nThis also explains why, in naive latent action learning approaches like LAPA and Genie, latent action tokens mostly encode motion/dynamics—since texture information is already preserved from previous frames for future frame prediction in the decoder. ", "If your goal is to learn task-relevant tokens, why not directly use contrastive learning to encode those tokens and perform a soft alignment with the text instruction features? Have you tried this approach? It seems like a more straightforward way to achieve your objective.\n", "@retsuh-bqw Thanks for your detailed explanation.\n\nTo support your claims, I think it would be helpful to demonstrate what kind of behavior the latent actions actually exhibit. Have you tried comparing them in a way similar to LAPA Figure 13? Or perhaps visualizing the reconstructions like in LAPA Figure 14?", "> If your goal is to learn task-relevant tokens, why not directly use contrastive learning to encode those tokens and perform a soft alignment with the text instruction features? Have you tried this approach? It seems like a more straightforward way to achieve your objective.\n\n@dreamcubeblock We haven't tried this approach yet, but here's our reasoning: During a task episode, the latent action should evolve over time while the language instruction remains the same. Explicit contrastive alignment could harm convergence in this case, as it may be more suitable for learning latent actions that represent the entire task rollout rather than individual steps.", "> [@retsuh-bqw](https://github.com/retsuh-bqw) Thanks for your detailed explanation.\n> \n> To support your claims, I think it would be helpful to demonstrate what kind of behavior the latent actions actually exhibit.

While we cannot perform explicit reconstruction (since LAM operates in DINO space rather than raw pixels), we have conducted related analyses:\n\n- Figures 8 & A-1 demonstrate that latent actions exhibit semantic consistency across environments and embodiments.\n\n- Figure A-3 explores the attention patterns between latent actions and DINO features." ],

      "description" : "**1. Overview:**\n\nEnsure robust and up-to-date integration of the OpenAI API as a core LLM provider within the `voltagent` framework, utilizing the official `openai` Node.js SDK. This involves verifying support for the latest OpenAI models (GPT-4, GPT-3.5 variants), features (like tool calling, JSON mode), and ensuring the implementation aligns perfectly with the `LLMProvider` interface and `voltagent` conventions.\n\n**2. Goals:**\n\n*   Implement or verify a dedicated `OpenAIProvider` class adhering to the `LLMProvider` interface.\n*   Support core generation functionalities (`generateText`, `streamText`, `generateObject`, `streamObject`) using OpenAI models.\n*   Utilize the latest official `openai` Node.js SDK.\n*   Correctly map `voltagent` generation options (model, temperature, max tokens, tool choice, etc.) to OpenAI API parameters.\n*   Implement robust support for OpenAI's tool calling mechanism, mapping seamlessly to `voltagent`'s tool definition and execution flow.\n*   Support OpenAI's JSON mode for reliable structured output generation (`generateObject`/`streamObject`).\n*   Handle authentication using OpenAI API keys.\n*   Integrate OpenAI-specific error handling and response parsing.\n\n**3. Proposed Architecture & Components:**\n\n*   **`OpenAIProvider`:** A class (potentially existing but needing review/update) within `agent/providers` implementing `LLMProvider`. It should:\n    *   Use the official `openai` Node.js library.\n    *   Handle API client initialization (API key, potentially base URL for proxies).\n    *   Implement `generateText`, `streamText`, `generateObject`, `streamObject`, correctly formatting requests (messages, tools, model parameters) and parsing responses/streams.\n    *   Specifically handle the `tool_calls` and `tool_results` message flow for tool usage.\n*   **Provider Registration:** Ensure `OpenAIProvider` is correctly registered and selectable.\n*   **Configuration:** Allow users to select 'openai' as the provider, specify models (e.g., 'gpt-4-turbo', 'gpt-3.5-turbo'), and provide API keys.\n*   **Tool Mapping:** Refine the logic that translates `voltagent` tool definitions into the format expected by the OpenAI API's `tools` parameter and processes `tool_calls` responses.\n\n**4. Affected Core Modules:**\n\n*   `agent/providers`: `OpenAIProvider` class implementation/refinement.\n*   `agent/types`: Ensure types accurately reflect OpenAI's request/response structures, especially for tools.\n*   `ToolManager`: Interaction with `OpenAIProvider` for formatting tool definitions and handling tool calls.\n*   `Agent`/`Agent Options`: Configuration for provider selection, models, and credentials.\n*   Requires the `openai` dependency.\n\n**5. Acceptance Criteria (Initial MVP / Refinement):**\n\n*   Users can configure an `Agent` to use `OpenAIProvider` with various GPT models (e.g., GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-3.5 Turbo) and an API key.\n*   `agent.generateText()` and `agent.streamText()` work correctly.\n*   `agent.generateObject()` and `agent.streamObject()` utilize OpenAI's JSON mode successfully.\n*   Agents can reliably use tools defined in `voltagent`, with requests and responses correctly handled via the OpenAI tool calling API.\n*   Relevant options (temperature, max tokens, tool choice) are passed correctly.\n*   Integration uses the current version of the official `openai` SDK.\n*   Documentation reflects the updated/verified OpenAI integration details.\n\n**6. Potential Challenges & Considerations:**\n\n*   Keeping up with frequent updates and changes in the OpenAI API and SDK.\n*   Ensuring the tool calling implementation is robust and handles various edge cases (multiple tool calls, errors).\n*   Mapping `voltagent`'s internal state/history accurately to the sequence of messages expected by OpenAI, especially when including tool results.\n*   Handling differences in behavior or features across different OpenAI models.\n*   Cost management and monitoring token usage for OpenAI API calls.",

      "description" : "Add \"Rename\" Button for Preset Management with Popup Modal\r\n\r\n**Description:**\r\nWe need to add a \"Rename\" button between the ComboBox (for selecting presets) and the \"Delete\" button. When clicked, this button should open a popup modal asking the user to enter a new name for the selected preset. Upon confirming, the preset's name should be updated in the object (`presets.name`) and the associated file. The previous file with the old name should be deleted.\r\n\r\n**Tasks:**\r\n\r\n1. **Add the \"Rename\" button:**\r\n   - Place the \"Rename\" button between the ComboBox (preset selector) and the \"Delete\" button.\r\n   - Ensure the button is clearly labeled and fits within the existing layout.\r\n\r\n2. **Implement the popup modal:**\r\n   - Create a modal that appears when the \"Rename\" button is clicked.\r\n   - The modal should include:\r\n     - An input field for the new preset name.\r\n     - \"Confirm\" and \"Cancel\" buttons.\r\n   - The \"Confirm\" button should only be enabled if the input field is not empty.\r\n\r\n3. **Handle renaming logic:**\r\n   - Update the `presets.name` property with the new name when the user clicks \"Confirm\".\r\n   - Rename the corresponding preset file to match the new name and delete the old file.\r\n   - Ensure the file renaming is done safely, checking for any name conflicts or invalid characters.\r\n\r\n4. **Update the ComboBox selection and display:**\r\n   - Refresh the ComboBox options to reflect the updated preset name.\r\n   - Maintain the current selection in the ComboBox with the new name after renaming.\r\n\r\n5. **Test the renaming functionality:**\r\n   - Verify that the \"Rename\" button opens the modal correctly.\r\n   - Test renaming with various inputs (valid, invalid, empty, conflicting names).\r\n   - Confirm that the file is renamed correctly and the old file is deleted.\r\n   - Ensure the ComboBox updates to reflect the new name without issues.\r\n\r\n6. **Update documentation:**\r\n   - Document the new \"Rename\" functionality.\r\n   - Update any relevant sections of the user guide to explain how to rename presets.\r\n\r\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\r\n- The \"Rename\" button appears between the ComboBox and \"Delete\" button and functions as intended.\r\n- The popup modal asks the user for a new name, and the \"Confirm\" button only works when a valid name is provided.\r\n- The preset's name is updated both in the object (`presets.name`) and the corresponding file.\r\n- The previous file is deleted after renaming.\r\n- The ComboBox correctly displays the updated preset name.\r\n- Documentation is updated to reflect the new feature.\r\n\r\n**Additional Context:**\r\n- The project uses ImGui, and the modal should integrate seamlessly with the existing UI.\r\n- Ensure that renaming presets does not interfere with other functionalities like saving, loading, or deleting presets.",

Additionally, OpenAI seems to strangely bounce you back-and-forth between two equally obscure error messages if you cut-and-paste the error & ask for assistance.\n\nHey Jeremy, sure, as an example, in pyproject.toml the `tool.poetry.source` section must be an array, like `[[tool.poetry.source]]` even if you only specify one source. This makes total sense as arrays with 1 entry are completely valid.  \n\nThe confusion is that poetry will give you the error in my original message, which tells you something should be an array but not _which_ something, so the solution currently is just to review your pyproject.toml file very carefully with respect to what each tool you have using it expects.", "We already replace `data.` with `tool.poetry.` in https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry-core/blob/002aa3e16f98d21645bb9a45f698b55adc40f317/src/poetry/core/factory.py#L606-L609.\n\nWe probably have to do the same in https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/blob/aeaa3d09ce7381bf34ac7e0ac27b929841256c90/src/poetry/factory.py#L335." ],

This application should contain:\r\n\r\n-   A web server running on port 8080 using the nginx image.\r\n-   A database server running on the default port using the postgres image.\r\n\r\nThe web server should have access to the database server but not vice versa.\r\n\r\n## Requirements:\r\n\r\n-   Use Docker Compose version 3.\r\n-   Specify service names, image versions, and exposed ports.\r\n-   Set up a custom network and make sure only the web server can communicate with the database.\r\n-   Use environment variables to set the database name, user, and password for the PostgreSQL service.\r\n\r\n## Example Structure:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nversion: '3'\r\n\r\nservices:\r\n  # Define your services here\r\n  \r\nnetworks:\r\n  # Define your networks here\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Evaluation Criteria:\r\n\r\n-   Valid YAML syntax.\r\n-   Correct use of Docker Compose version and features.\r\n-   Correct network setup.\r\n-   The web server should be able to connect to the database, but the database should not have access to the web server.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions and how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

It is clear that many contributors are not reading the contributing.MD or the documentation update readme. \n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nWe are a welcoming community and we would like to include all regardless of their learning methodology. Some read, others watch. So, we would like a video to welcome contributors and walk them through the basics of contributing to KubeStellar. Once completed, we can create a shortcut url and give it to anyone with a question about making a contribution. This saves everyone time.\n\n### Are you willing to contribute?\n\n- [ ] Yes, I'd like to help implement this feature.\n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_",

The actions-user bot will reset the file back to previous state for the next contributor after your commit is merged. So you can just simply start working with the issue right away!*\r\n\r\n## How to get started\r\n\r\nFor this task you need to have Python and NumPy installed. Check out [Installing Python](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge#installing-python) section in README if you need to install Python. If you already have Python installed, you can install NumPy using pip (Python's package installer) with the following terminal command:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npip install numpy\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr, if you're using Python 3 specifically and have both Python 2 and Python 3 installed, you may need to use:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npip3 install numpy\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter that you can open the `tasks/python/hard` directory from the root of the project. \r\nThen open `decision_tree.py` file and start working on your solution!\r\n\r\n![python-hard](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/assets/82566656/3fc4a704-a734-4b90-90fc-476ab367b7a1)\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nImplement a Decision Tree Classifier from scratch using Python. Do not use libraries like scikit-learn that have pre-implemented classifiers; instead, use basic libraries like NumPy for numerical calculations.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\n\r\n-   Understand the theory behind Decision Trees.\r\n-   Implement a simple yet functional Decision Tree Classifier.\r\n-   Test the classifier on a dataset.\r\n\r\nUse any freely available classification dataset. Ensure the dataset has at least 3 features and at least 2 classes.\r\n\r\nImplementation Steps:\r\n-   Write functions to calculate Gini impurity or Information Gain.\r\n-   Implement a class DecisionTree with methods for fitting and predicting.\r\n-   Implement a function to print/visualize the tree.\r\n\r\nTesting:\r\n-   Split the dataset into training and test sets and evaluate your classifier.\r\n\r\nAcceptance Criteria:\r\n\r\n-   Successfully implement a Decision Tree Classifier from scratch.\r\n-   Evaluate the classifier on a dataset, showing reasonable performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).\r\n\r\nResources:\r\n\r\n-   [Decision Trees - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning)\r\n\r\n## How to run\r\n\r\nMake sure you are in the right directory:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncd tasks/python/hard\r\n```\r\n\r\nExecute the following command to run your Python script:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npython decision_tree.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected output\r\n\r\nOutput should look similar to this:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nThe predicted class for the sample [0.4, 0.6] is 0.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the output looks correct, you are ready to make a pull request!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo work with this issue, you need to have Python installed to your local machine.\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions of installing Python and how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

      "comments" : [ "<!-- Answer -->\nThis issue is caused by a disconnect between the context available to Jinja templates during regular chart rendering and what is provided during drill-to-detail actions. When you drill, the frontend sends a new request that often lacks the full dashboard/global context (like dashboard filters or URL params) that your Jinja SQL expects, so the template renders incorrectly or with missing values. This is a known limitation and has been discussed in several issues and code reviews ([example](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/33591), [example](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/33579)).\n\nA workaround is to make your Jinja SQL more robust by using `if/else` blocks to provide default values when filters are missing, so the query always returns results and columns don't disappear. For example:\n\n```sql\nWITH calculation as (\n  SELECT count(*), country\n  FROM \"Vehicle Sales\"\n  WHERE 1=1\n  {% if filter_values('product_line') %}\n    and product_line in {{ filter_values('product_line')|where_in }}\n  {% else %}\n    and product_line = 'Classic Cars'\n  {% endif %}\n  GROUP BY country\n)\nSELECT * FROM calculation\n```\n([source](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/33591))\n\nIf your dataset relies on dashboard-level filters or variables, you may need to adjust your Jinja logic to handle cases where those are missing during drill actions.\n\nThere have also been recent changes to how Superset syncs dataset columns and processes Jinja templates, which can impact this behavior ([PR 30903](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/30903)). Make sure your configuration enables `ENABLE_TEMPLATE_PROCESSING` and that your feature flags are up to date.\n\nAt this time, there is no full workaround for preserving all dashboard context in drill-to-detail requests, but making your Jinja SQL more defensive can help avoid empty or broken results.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

Because Longhorn mutator webhook requires providing [the correct `metadata.labels`](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn-manager/blob/16f796214eb359cdb9f9efbe577a2de68144081b/webhook/resources/backup/mutator.go#L63-L67) while the doc does not mention that.\n\nThere are 2 solutions for this:\n- Simply updating the doc by adding `metadata.labels` for the example YAMLs\n- The mutator should figure out and set up the labels automatically based on the input `spec.snapshotName`\n\nNow I may prefer the latter one since this solution can both\n- provide a better user experience\n- and forcibly ask the mutator to check the volume and snapshot existence before backup creation\n\n### To Reproduce\n\n1. Create and attach a volume\n2. Create a random snapshot\n3. Apply the following backup YAML provided by the doc:\n```\napiVersion: longhorn.io/v1beta2\nkind: Backup\nmetadata:\n  name: backup-example\n  namespace: longhorn-system\nspec:\n  backupMode: full\n  snapshotName: <volume snapshot name>\n  labels:\n    app: test\n```\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe backup should be created correctly\n\n### Support Bundle for Troubleshooting\n\n```\nubuntu:~$ kubectl apply -f backup.yaml\nError from server (InternalError): error when creating \"backup.yaml\": Internal error occurred: failed calling webhook \"mutator.longhorn.io\": failed to call webhook: post \"https://longhorn-admission-webhock.longhorn-system.svc:9502/v1/webhook/mutation?timeout=10s\": EOF\n```\n\n### Environment\n\n- Longhorn version: master-head (07/02/2025)\n\n### Additional context\n\nThis issue was found by community contributor @nzhan126  when she tried to test a backup-related fix. \n\n### Workaround and Mitigation\n\nSet up `matadata.labels` for the backup YAML. For example:\n```\napiVersion: longhorn.io/v1beta2\nkind: Backup\nmetadata:\n  name: backup-example\n  namespace: longhorn-system\n  labels:\n    backup-volume: <volume name>\nspec:\n  backupMode: full\n  snapshotName: <volume snapshot name>\n  labels:\n    app: test\n```\n",

While it is not explicitly stored in the footer, it can be estimated by analyzing the number of pages via the `OrdinalIndex` and calculating the average page size.  \n\nIt might be worthwhile to include a few functions for inspecting a column's metadata.\n\nFurther more, we can also consider add these column stats into the optimizer statistics system, stored in the `_statistics_.column_statistics` table.\n\n",

As of now, Souvlaki leaves it up to the user to change the URL depending on the platform.\r\n\r\nFor Linux, we follow the MPRIS specification, which actually doesn't say much cover art apart from what's in [here](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/mpris-spec/metadata/#mpris:arturl). It only says that local files should start with `file://` and that it should be an UTF-8 string, which is enforced by Rust. Maybe you can look in the source code of desktop managers such as GNOME or KDE, since these read the field to display it on their media player controls.\r\n\r\nFor Windows, we use the _SystemMediaTransportControlsDisplayUpdater_, which has [a thumbnail property](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.media.systemmediatransportcontrolsdisplayupdater.thumbnail?view=winrt-22621#windows-media-systemmediatransportcontrolsdisplayupdater-thumbnail). It accepts multiple formats, but we choose to create it using an URI. If setting an URL starting with `file://`, the file is automatically loaded by souvlaki.\r\n\r\nFor MacOS, you can look into [these lines](https://github.com/Sinono3/souvlaki/blob/384539fe83e8bf5c966192ba28e9405e3253619b/src/platform/macos/mod.rs#L131-L137) of the implementation. These lines refer to creating an [MPMediaItemArtwork](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mediaplayer/mpmediaitemartwork) object.\r\n\r\nI hope this is of use to you.

Update the task servers to remove the manual activation and deactivation. We do need to take some care that the instantiation of the interfaces then are ordered since some subscription callbacks might depend on some publishers activation or existence. So we should be creating all exporters (i.e. action clients, service clients, publishers) before  consumers (i.e. actions, services, subscribers) -- and deactivating all consumers before exporters (inverted). \n\nOn top, in the nav2 lifecycle node, we should autoactivate if the node is already activated when an interface is created (see `nav2::Publisher` for example)\n\n",

Please do some research to make sure that replacing `Update` with `Patch` does not change the behavior of current impl.\n2. If it is possible to using `Patch`, then refactor the code in this package. \n3. Pass the test in this package.\n4.

Yes we should definitly leave the get_uri method as it is (not get_url as it doesn’t exist yet) and implement a new get_url method which would then be called by the existing get_sqlalchemy_engine.\r\n\r\nYes, adding new method is the way to go. How to do it, should be proposed and discussed in the PR, we have 20+ sql providers, and I think the proposal should be complete and explain how to deal with cases that can/cannot be mapped. Also the method should explicily - IMHO - call our sqlalachemy, (`getSqlAlchemyURI` ?) and likely allow variations - from what I understand SQLAlchemy can have different URLs not only for different databases, but also for different drivers. Also some of our Connections allows to add different kinds of extras and parameters - not only hosts but other parameters that might be used and passed differently to different drivers.\r\n\r\nIf we decide to introduce a new \"standard\" method, in a product like Airflow and common API like DBApiHook, the proposal should provide answers to all the questions that users might ask in order to be mergable. It does not have to handle all of those but at least get enough error handlling and interface specification to explain what is the transition from the Connection form (in all those cases we have DBAPI implementation) -> SQLAlchemy URL.  Which variations are handled, how it should work, how to map engine args etc. \r\n\r\nI don't think it can be handled by a single implementation, it's more a scaffloiding + implementation for all the implementations and it should be designed nicely with al least a handful (if not all) implementation from the above list to be quite sure that we will be able to handle those cases. \r\n", "\r\n> Hey Andrey think there is some confusion here.

Even at a very high resolution (3840x1600 in my case) with btop maximized, and the left panel hidden, it's impossible to see the full command much of the time.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nI'd like to be able to specify a prefix (maybe regex) to exclude some parts of the process command. For example, instead of `/nix/store/<long string>/bin/.firefox-wrapped --name firefox`, I could configure it to just show `bin/firefox-wrapped --name firefox`.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nUsing a different distro would solve this but I don't wanna.\n\n**Additional context**\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c08d3137-e71b-492c-b81c-1c86827c9803)",

We need to add more to cover all the code in vllm-ascend, and there are several principles to follow:\n\n1. The overall file tree should be consistent with `vllm_ascend`\n2. The file name should be the original file name with a prefix `test_`\n3. Use `unittest` framework, make good use of mock\n4. The UTs are all running on cpu node, mock the function related to device to host\n\nPlease refer to the official doc on [contributing](https://vllm-ascend.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide/contribution/index.html) and [testing](https://vllm-ascend.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide/contribution/testing.html) to develop, thanks!\n### Unit tests need to add\n\n- [ ] |-- test__version.py\n- [x] |-- test_ascend_config.py\n- [ ] |-- test_attention\n- [ ] |   |-- test_attention.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_attention_v1.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_mla_v1.py\n- [ ] |-- compilation\n- [ ] |   `-- test_piecewise_backend.py\n- [ ] |-- core\n- [ ] |   |-- test_schedule_config.py @nuclearwu\n- [ ] |   `-- test_scheduler.py\n- [ ] |-- device_allocator\n- [ ] |   `-- test_camem.py\n- [ ] |-- distributed\n- [ ] |   |-- test_communicator.py @FieeFlip\n- [ ] |   |-- test_device_communicators @Agonixiaoxiao #1601\n- [ ] |   |   |-- test_pyhccl.py\n- [ ] |   |   `-- test_pyhccl_wrapper.py\n- [x] |   |-- kv_transfer @Agonixiaoxiao \n- [x] |   |   |-- test_simple_buffer.py https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1531\n- [x] |   |   |-- test_simple_connector.py https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1531\n- [x] |   |   |-- test_simple_pipe.py https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1531\n- [ ] |   |   `-- test_utils.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_llmdatadist_connector.py\n- [x] |   `-- test_parallel_state.py   @wangyanhui-cmss https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1460\n- [ ] |-- test_envs.py\n- [ ] |-- lora\n- [ ] |   `-- punica_wrapper @hongfugui\n- [ ] |       `-- test_punica_npu.py @hongfugui\n- [ ] |-- models\n- [ ] |   |-- test_deepseek_dbo.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_deepseek_mtp.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_deepseek_v2.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_qwen2_5_vl.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_qwen2_5_vl_without_padding.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_qwen2_vl.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_qwen3_moe.py\n- [ ] |-- multistream\n- [ ] |   |-- test_base.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_context.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_decorator.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_layers.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_metadata.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_ms_split.py\n- [ ] |-- ops\n- [ ] |   |-- test_activation.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_attention.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_cache.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_common_fused_moe.py\n- [x] |   |-- test_expert_load_balancer.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_fused_moe.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_layernorm.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_rotary_embedding.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_vocab_parallel_embedding.py\n- [ ] |-- patch\n- [ ] |   |-- platform\n- [ ] |   |   |-- patch_0_9_1\n- [ ] |   |   |-- patch_common\n- [ ] |   |   |   `-- test_test_patch_distributed.py\n- [ ] |   |   `-- patch_main\n- [ ] |   `-- worker\n- [ ] |       |-- patch_0_9_1\n- [ ] |       |-- patch_common\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_distributed.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_eagle.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_minicpm.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_multi_step_worker.py\n- [x] |       |   |-- test_patch_sampler.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_spec_decode_worker.py\n- [ ] |       |   `-- test_patch_utils.py\n- [ ] |       `-- patch_main\n- [x] |-- test_platform.py @zhanghw0354 https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1476\n- [ ] |-- quantization\n- [ ] |   |-- test_func_wrapper.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_quant_config.py @nuclearwu\n- [ ] |   |-- test_quantizer.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_w8a8.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_w8a8_dynamic.py\n- [ ] |-- sample\n- [ ] |   |-- ops\n- [ ] |   `-- test_rejection_sampler.py\n- [x] |-- test_utils.py\n- [ ] `-- worker \n- [ ] |-- test_cache_engine.py @machenglong2025\n- [ ] |-- test_draft_model_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_model_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_model_runner_v1.py\n- [ ]  |-- test_mtp_proposer_v1.py @machenglong2025\n- [ ] |-- test_multi_step_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_multi_step_worker.py\n- [ ] |-- test_pooling_model_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_worker.py @zhanghw0354\n- [ ] `-- test_worker_v1.py @zhanghw0354\n",

Please @MisterJimson provide us a repository to test ", "Hello @MisterJimson, please provide a minimal reproduction. You can use one of the following options:\n\n- Provide a link to [our playground](https://biomejs.dev/playground), if it's applicable.\n- Provide a link to GitHub repository. To easily create a reproduction, you can use our interactive CLI via `npm create @biomejs/biome-reproduction`\n\nIssues marked with `S-Needs repro` will be **closed** if they have **no activity within 3 days**.", "I'm actually on the fence whether this should be considered a false positive at all. Files that either accidentally or intentionally import/export from themselves _are_ creating a cycle, albeit a very small one. In many cases I think people want to be alerted about this, so I think this isn't an issue, although you could open a discussion whether we should have an option for this case.\n\nWhat actually worries me more is why it's not being reported in your IDE \uD83E\uDD14 ", "FYI This case isn't marked as a cycle in eslint. And oxc has the same bug and are fixing it: https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/issues/11646\n\nWe are switching to whichever project fixes it first.", "FYI @arendjr, if we want to keep the existing behaviour, we should change the rule metadata and mark it as inspired. Currently, it is marked as \"the same as\". ", "I just tried it in both node and bun. Both allow the file to import itself without blowing up.\n\nAlthough I tend to agree that this would be a code smell. I imagine the goal of the original rule was to alert for things that would crash and burn.", "Does anyone have a suggested alternative approach that preserves similar syntax?\n\n```ts\nexport function example1() {\n  return 1;\n}\n\nexport function example2() {\n  return 2;\n}\n\nexport * as Example from './test';\n\n// usage example\nimport { Example } from '@package/test'\n\nconst value = Example.example2();\n```\n\nThe goal is to have namespaced functions.", "You could put all the functions in a static class, and then just export the class.", "That's an idea. Would need to disable https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-static-only-class/  though.\n\nThe other thing to consider is tree shaking. If it's purely an import style like I have now, I believe fully unused functions are still able to be removed. Would the same be true for a static class? Not sure...", "In that case, I think it makes sense to not flag these cases where the file imports itself.", "I think so too, we shouldn't flag this case", "I can take this one as well" ],

      "comments" : [ "Sorry, I haven't tried IPv6 in Docker. This weekend I tried to set up a local IPv6 network by using VirtualBox, but not successful.\r\n\r\nI checked our servers and found the IPv6 address of `docker0` is like `fe80::aaaa:bbbb:cccc:dddd`, not `fe80::1` you showed. I'm not sure if this is an issue?\r\n\r\nFrom the document [IPv6 with Docker | Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/v17.09/engine/userguide/networking/default_network/ipv6/) we can see that the IPv6 address of `docker0` is like `2001:db8::c008/125`.\r\n\r\nSo sorry, I cannot help you now. But I would like to try IPv6 when I have time.\r\n\r\nIf you have any updates please let me know, thanks!", "@chaifeng thank you for your timely response. I took a look at the documentation you mentioned and made the changes that they describe. It now looks like the docker0 interface has two versions of an IPv6 address. I will admit i'm pretty new to firewalls and very new to ufw so i'm not even sure what the best way to debug this would be. I don't really need IPV6 container support and I think it would be better to have the IPV6 requests to my server to be forwarded as IPV4, but i'm not sure how to do that. \r\n\r\nThe reason I found this issue was because I was unable to access my website from my phone when not connected to WIFI. My LTE connection has an IPV6 address which makes my site unreachable.\r\n\r\nifconfig: \r\n```\r\ndocker0: flags=4099<UP,BROADCAST,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500\r\n        inet 172.17.0.1  netmask 255.255.0.0  broadcast 172.17.255.255\r\n        inet6 fe80::1  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>\r\n        inet6 2001:db8:1::1  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x0<global>\r\n        ether 02:42:0e:75:6d:9a  txqueuelen 0  (Ethernet)\r\n        RX packets 0  bytes 0 (0.0 B)\r\n        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0\r\n        TX packets 0  bytes 0 (0.0 B)\r\n        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have updated my after6.rules to reflect the new address:\r\n```\r\n# BEGIN UFW AND DOCKER\r\n*filter\r\n:ufw6-user-forward - [0:0]\r\n:DOCKER-USER - [0:0]\r\n-A DOCKER-USER -j RETURN -s 2001:db8:1::/64\r\n-A DOCKER-USER -p udp -m udp --sport 53 --dport 1024:65535 -j RETURN\r\n\r\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw6-user-forward\r\n\r\n-A DOCKER-USER -j DROP -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,ACK SYN -d 2001:db8:1::/64\r\n-A DOCKER-USER -j DROP -p udp -m udp --dport 0:32767 -d 2001:db8:1::/64\r\n\r\n-A DOCKER-USER -j RETURN\r\nCOMMIT\r\n# END UFW AND DOCKER\r\n```\r\n\r\nI enabled ufw logging and I can still see the request being blocked.

If one deploys Docker on a publicly available system, for example, on a server with a public IP, there is not necessarily a firewall in front of it.", "> This is only the case if you have a router in front of your Docker host (e.g., in a homelab situation).\n\n@maxkratz This is my setup, at home. OpenWRT at the front, two vlans, server with docker on second vlan.  I always worry somehow I'm exposing my services over IPv6 by mistake because IPv6 doesn't work the same as IPv4-NAT. ", "@ShapeShifter499 I think the goal of `ufw-docker` is to block network access to docker containers running on the host from whatever network is attached to the host. Exactly like the goal of `ufw` is to block network access to processes running on the host from whatever network is attached to the host.\nThe network attached to the host can be public (typical of a public server rented from a provider) or private (typical of a home or company network).\nEven if your network is private, for whatever reason you might want to block access to a container (or to a specific port of that container) from that network and only allow access to it from the docker host.\nThe above is true regardless of whether your docker host has IPv4 or IPv6 (or both) on its network interface(s). You'll have to deal with separate and independent block rules for IPv4 and IPv6.\n\nIf your docker host is on a private network behind a router/firewall and you are happy for whatever container to be accessible from that private network, you may disregard `ufw-docker` completely and only use your router/firewall to control access from the public internet (or other private networks).\nThe above is also true regardless of whether your internet provider provides you with IPv4 or IPv6 (or both) connectivity. With home IPv4 connectivity there is typically NAT between the public internet and your private network that blocks inbound connections by default. If your ISP also provides you with IPv6 connectivity, that's typically not the case (afaik) and you really need to make sure your firewall (OpenWRT) has specific IPv6 rules in place to block all inbound connections by default and only allow the connections you want.", "this pr was merged https://github.com/chaifeng/ufw-docker/pull/92" ],

Forked and cloned the repository, then searched the codebase for `readline` usage to find the core input handling logic.\n2.  Identified `useKeypress.ts` (for raw keypress events) and `InputPrompt.tsx` (for input logic) as the key files.\n3.  To see what the application receives, I temporarily modified the code to log every keypress event to a `debug.log` file.\n4.  **Key Finding:** My initial debugging proved that on a default macOS Terminal, `Shift+Enter` sends the exact same sequence (`\\r`) as a regular `Enter` press, making the two indistinguishable.\n\n### Attempted Fix & The Final Discovery\n\nBased on the initial finding, I attempted a code-only fix by teaching the application to listen for a different key combination, `Shift+Down`, which often sends a unique sequence on other terminals.\n\n1. The Code I Tested\nI modified `useKeypress.ts` to listen for the `Shift+Down` sequence (`\\x1b[1;2B`) and `InputPrompt.tsx` to handle a `key.shift` flag.\n\n```typescript\n// In useKeypress.ts, I added a check:\nif (key.sequence === '\\x1b[1;2B') {\n  key.name = 'return';\n  key.shift = true;\n}\n```\n```typescript\n// In InputPrompt.tsx, I added the key.shift check:\nif (key.ctrl || key.meta || key.shift || charBefore === '\\\\' || key.paste) {\n  // ... newline logic\n}\n```\n\n2. The Result: It Also Failed\nThis proof-of-concept did not work. To understand why, I used the `cat` command to see what my terminal was actually sending when I pressed `Shift+Down`.\nFinal Proof: The terminal sent `^[[B`, which is the standard escape code for a plain Cursor Down key.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis investigation leads to a definitive conclusion: the default macOS Terminal is more limited than anticipated. It appears to strip the `Shift` modifier information from both the `Enter` key and the arrow keys, making a code-only fix for a `Shift+Key` newline combination unfeasible on this specific platform, although i think this might work on other platforms which by default register shift + down as '\\x1b[1;2B' but i cant really test it.\n\nThis might explain why `Ctrl+J` is a common suggested alternative, as it sends a universal newline character (`\\n`) that doesn't rely on modifier key parsing.\n\nAs this is my first contribution, my analysis could be wrong, and I apologize for the detailed-but-failed attempt. Given these findings, what is the desired path forward? Any information from the internal `b.corp.google.com` link about how other terminals are supported would still be very helpful.\n\nThank you for your time and guidance.", "Just to add, I personally use the Warp Terminal on Mac.

This can result in a token length that exceeds the limits set by the system. Here are some steps you can take to address this issue:您在使用 Dify 中的 Volcengine 插件时遇到的 \"标记太长 \"错误可能与处理大数据输入（如转换为 base64 编码的图像）有关。这可能导致标记长度超出系统设置的限制。以下是解决此问题的一些步骤：\n> \n> 1. **Reduce Image Size**: Try reducing the size of the images before uploading them to Dify. This can help prevent the base64 encoded data from exceeding the token limit.**减小图片大小 **：在将图片上传到 Dify 之前，请尝试减小图片大小。这有助于防止 base64 编码数据超出令牌限制。\n> 2. **Check Token Limits**: Ensure that the token limits for your model and API requests are configured correctly. Dify imposes a generation length limit of 2k tokens for reasoning models, which might be relevant if your workflow involves such models [[1]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/17120).**检查令牌限制 **：确保正确配置模型和 API 请求的令牌限制。Dify 为推理模型规定了 2k 标记的生成长度限制，如果您的工作流涉及此类模型，则可能与此相关 [[1]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/17120) 。\n> 3. **Switch Model Provider**: If you're using the `openai_api_compatible` provider, consider switching to a different model provider that might handle larger token sizes more effectively [[2]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/18657).**切换模型提供程序 **：如果您正在使用 `openai_api_compatible` 提供程序，请考虑切换到不同的模型提供程序，这样可以更有效地处理更大的标记大小 [[2]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/18657) 。\n> 4. **Review Workflow Configuration**: Double-check your workflow configuration to ensure that all parameters and settings are optimized for handling the data sizes you're working with.**审查工作流程配置 **：仔细检查您的工作流程配置，确保所有参数和设置都经过优化，以处理您正在处理的数据大小。\n> \n> By implementing these suggestions, you should be able to mitigate the \"token too long\" error and improve the stability of your plugin operations.通过实施这些建议，您应该可以减少 \"标记太长 \"错误，并提高插件运行的稳定性。\n> \n> _To continue talking to [Dosu](https://dosu.dev), mention [@dosu](https://github.com/dosu).要继续与 [Dosu](https://dosu.dev) 通话，请提及 。_\n> \n> Help Dosu learn!

      "description" : "We are in the process of moving this repository to Read the Docs, and to do that we need to convert our pages from Markdown to RST. This issue is to transfer the Onboarding section: [https://contribute.mautic.org/on-boarding](https://contribute.mautic.org/on-boarding). You can also update and improve the content on these pages if you like - do check with the team leads first to ensure it's relevant.\r\n\r\nYou can do this in the current repo, as we've got a folder set up, `/docs`, which will be used for Read The Docs.\r\n\r\nYou can build this documentation locally by cloning this repository, and following these steps: https://github.com/mautic/user-documentation/tree/5.x?tab=readme-ov-file#build-documentation-locally. Change into the /docs folder and then (assuming you have DDEV and Docker/Colima installed) type `ddev config` and select `build/html `as the root folder when configuring DDEV. Then when complete, type `ddev start` and it'll give you the link to your local testing environment.\r\n\r\nIf you need to make a link file to add an external URL, please use the command line tool 'make link'. This will generate a reference macro and a link file for you.\r\n\r\nFor internal linking check the docs on using the [:ref: role](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/cross-referencing-with-sphinx.html#the-ref-role) for linking within the same document, and using [:doc: to link across pages](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/cross-referencing-with-sphinx.html#the-doc-role).\r\n\r\n**Please note: if you see folders called .revs these are old version control files from Grav. Ignore them! (they should be deleted) and instead work on the actual files.**\r\n\r\nWhen you've converted the file/s, **they need to live within the /docs folder**. We can create a structure using sub-folders to organise the sections. You also need to add the pages to the Table of Contents in the index.rst file for them to show on the menu. Docs on the ToC can be found [here](https://sublime-and-sphinx-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/indices.html).\r\nWe highly recommend that you use VS Code with Vale installed. Let us know if you have any problems.\r\n\r\nSome useful resources: \r\n- https://sublime-and-sphinx-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest guide to Sphinx/RST formatting\r\n- https://sublime-and-sphinx-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/references.html#use-the-external-links-extension how to do external links - always check the /docs/links directory first! You can use the terminal command '`make link`' to create the link file automagically.\r\n\r\nThere are many MD to RST tools out there which can help speed up the process, however you will still need to review your output to ensure it passes our Vale grammar rules. Headings must always be unique, as well.\r\n\r\nWe use the following for headings:\r\n\r\n```\r\nH1 ###\r\nH2 ***\r\nH3 ===\r\nH4 ---\r\nH5 ~~~\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease ask in #t-education on Slack if you get stuck with anything!",

It currently lists quite a few functions and packages.\n\n### Recommended process\n\n1. Run deadcode tool and pick ONE package to focus on.\n2. Post a comment to this issue stating which package you're working on\n3. Do not just delete the package / function, do some research first\n   * find where (which PR) the function was introduced and what was using it & why\n   * ideally find the PR in which that usage was removed without removing the function itself\n   * post your findings in the comments to validate with maintainers that it's ok to delete\n",

      "description" : "# Background\n\n[crash](https://crash-utility.github.io/)'s command-oriented interface, while less flexible than drgn, has some distinct advantages:\n\n* For common operations, it is much more terse.\n* Many kernel developers are already comfortable with it.\n\nThere have also been requests for a crash-to-drgn translation guide. As a response, we are porting crash commands to drgn, adding a `--drgn` option to onboard users to drgn's more advanced functionality.\n\n# Contributing\n\nThe porting process is being tracked in https://github.com/users/osandov/projects/2. If you would like to work on a command, comment here (or reach out to @osandov) and we will create a new issue to track that command. Commands with many options can be split up further.\n\nCurrently, this work is in the `commands` branch, which is still a work in progress and will be rebased often. It will eventually be merged into the `main` branch.\n\n# Guidelines\n\n* The output format and behavior of each crash command should be recreated relatively closely in order to prioritize onboarding for crash users. However, we can deviate from crash if needed.\n* New functionality should be added as drgn helpers as much as possible. Ideally, commands should mainly call helpers and format output.\n* Every command should have a `--drgn` option that prints how to do the equivalent operation using drgn APIs.\n* Commands should be added to modules under `drgn/commands/_builtin/crash`. Feel free to create a new module if appropriate.\n* Test cases should be added under `tests/linux_kernel/crash_commands` for every command. Since most functionality should be in helpers with thorough unit tests, test cases for commands can be basic smoke tests.\n\nSee `_crash_cmd_mount()` in `drgn/commands/crash/_builtin/fs.py` and `TestMount` in `tests/linux_kernel/crash_commands/test_fs.py` for examples.",

      "description" : "### \uD83E\uDDED Epic\n\n**Title:** Configurable Connection-Retry Back-off for Database & Redis  \n**Goal:** Prevent gateway startup failures caused by slow-to-start services by making retry limits and intervals fully configurable. \n**Why now:** In containerised deployments Postgres (or any other SQL backend) and Redis often take several seconds to accept TCP connections. Today the gateway gives up on the first failure, crashing with `psycopg2.OperationalError: connection … refused`. Operators need a simple way—via environment variables, just like `DB_POOL_SIZE`, `CACHE_TYPE`, etc.—to tune how many times and how often the gateway retries before aborting.\n\n---\n\n### \uD83E\uDDED Type of Feature\n\n- [x] Enhancement to existing functionality\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDE4B‍♂️ User Story 1\n\n**As a:** DevOps engineer running MCP Gateway in Kubernetes  \n**I want:** to set `DB_MAX_RETRIES` and `DB_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS` for any SQLAlchemy-backed database  \n**So that:** the application patiently waits until the database container is ready, instead of crashing and restarting in a loop\n\n#### ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n```gherkin\nScenario: Database retries during startup\nGiven MCP Gateway starts with DB_MAX_RETRIES=10 and DB_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS=5000\nAnd the database is not yet ready\nWhen the first connection attempt fails\nThen the gateway should log \"DB connection failed (attempt 1/10), retrying in 5 s\"\nAnd it should retry every 5 s\nAnd after 10 failed attempts it should exit with a clear error message\n```\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDE4B‍♂️ User Story 2\n\n**As a:** Site Reliability Engineer using Redis caching  \n**I want:** analogous knobs `REDIS_MAX_RETRIES` and `REDIS_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS`  \n**So that:** the gateway’s cache layer behaves consistently with the database layer\n\n#### ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n```gherkin\nScenario: Redis retries respect custom settings\nGiven REDIS_MAX_RETRIES=15 and REDIS_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS=2000\nAnd Redis is unavailable\nWhen the cache subsystem initialises\nThen it must retry up to 15 times at 2 s intervals\nAnd surface a single aggregated error if all attempts fail\n```\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDE4B‍♂️ User Story 3\n\n**As a:** Platform administrator  \n**I want:** sensible defaults (3 retries × 2000 ms) so I don’t have to set anything for typical installs  \n**So that:** small deployments gain resilience out-of-the-box\n\n#### ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n```\n\nScenario: Defaults work when variables are unset\nGiven none of the four *_RETRIES or *_INTERVAL_MS variables are set\nWhen the gateway cannot reach the database\nThen it retries 3 times with 2 s between attempts\n\n```\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDCD0 Design Sketch (optional)\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\nsubgraph Settings\nENV[\".env / ENV vars\"]\nend\nENV --> Config[config.py load Settings]\nConfig -->|DB config| DBClient[SQLAlchemy Engine]\nConfig -->|Cache config| RedisClient[Redis Async Client]\n\nDBClient --> RetryLogic\nRedisClient --> RetryLogic\n\nRetryLogic{{\"Retry up to N timesnsleep(interval_ms)\"}}\nRetryLogic --> Logger\n```\n\n| Component | Change | Detail |\n|----------|--------|--------|\n| `config.py` | Add four `@env_settings` fields | `db_max_retries:int=3`, `db_retry_interval_ms:int=2000`, `redis_max_retries:int=3`, `redis_retry_interval_ms:int=2000` |\n| `db.py` | Wrap DB connect logic in retry loop | Use `asyncio.sleep()` for interval |\n| Redis cache init | Retry connect with same config | Applies if `CACHE_TYPE=redis` |\n| Logging | One log per retry attempt | Include attempt count and retry delay |\n| README | Add env var docs | Match style of existing DB/Redis config\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDD17 MCP Standards Check\n\n- [x] No protocol-level breaking changes\n- [x] Follows existing env var config conventions\n- [ ] Deviations: none\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDD04 Alternatives Considered\n\n| Alternative | Pros | Cons |\n|------------|------|------|\n| `docker-compose` healthcheck + `depends_on` | Simple for local dev | Doesn’t help bare-metal or k8s |\n| Exponential back-off | Faster in some cases | Adds complexity |\n| Gunicorn retry preload script | Works for some runners | Not general-purpose\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDCD3 Additional Context\n\n- Mirrors retry pattern used in `max_tool_retries`\n- Naming aligned with `DB_POOL_SIZE`, `CACHE_TYPE`, etc.\n- Ensure this is then changed in the helm chart.\n\nExample configuration:\n\n```bash\nexport DB_MAX_RETRIES=10\nexport DB_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS=5000\nexport REDIS_MAX_RETRIES=10\nexport REDIS_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS=5000\n```\n",

      "description" : "We are in the process of moving this repository to Read the Docs, and to do that we need to convert our pages from Markdown to RST. This issue is to transfer the Marketing team section: [https://contribute.mautic.org/marketing-team](https://contribute.mautic.org/marketing-team). You can also update and improve the content on these pages if you like - do check with the team lead (cc @sdoering and @tobsowo) first to ensure it's relevant.\r\n\r\nYou can do this in the current repo, as we've got a folder set up, `/docs`, which will be used for Read The Docs.\r\n\r\nYou can build this documentation locally by cloning this repository, and following these steps: https://github.com/mautic/user-documentation/tree/5.x?tab=readme-ov-file#build-documentation-locally. Change into the /docs folder and then (assuming you have DDEV and Docker/Colima installed) type `ddev config` and select `build/html `as the root folder when configuring DDEV. Then when complete, type `ddev start` and it'll give you the link to your local testing environment.\r\n\r\nIf you need to make a link file to add an external URL, please use the command line tool 'make link'. This will generate a reference macro and a link file for you.\r\n\r\nFor internal linking check the docs on using the [:ref: role](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/cross-referencing-with-sphinx.html#the-ref-role) for linking within the same document, and using [:doc: to link across pages](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/cross-referencing-with-sphinx.html#the-doc-role).\r\n\r\n**Please note: if you see folders called .revs these are old version control files from Grav. Ignore them! (they should be deleted) and instead work on the actual files.**\r\n\r\nWhen you've converted the file/s, **they need to live within the /docs folder**. We can create a structure using sub-folders to organise the sections. You also need to add the pages to the Table of Contents in the index.rst file for them to show on the menu. Docs on the ToC can be found [here](https://sublime-and-sphinx-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/indices.html).\r\n\r\nWe highly recommend that you use VS Code with Vale installed. Let us know if you have any problems.\r\n\r\nSome useful resources: \r\n- https://sublime-and-sphinx-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest guide to Sphinx/RST formatting\r\n- https://sublime-and-sphinx-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/references.html#use-the-external-links-extension how to do external links - always check the /docs/links directory first! You can use the terminal command '`make link`' to create the link file automagically.\r\n\r\nThere are many MD to RST tools out there which can help speed up the process, however you will still need to review your output to ensure it passes our Vale grammar rules. Headings must always be unique, as well.\r\n\r\nWe use the following for headings:\r\n\r\n```\r\nH1 ###\r\nH2 ***\r\nH3 ===\r\nH4 ---\r\nH5 ~~~\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease ask in #t-education on Slack if you get stuck with anything!",

This is not an acceptable UI, especially for core site functionality like upvoting.\n\n@ninakali Could you share which tool and setting you used to produce the screenshots? I've used a few over the years and would like to be certain we don't accidentally test with one that doesn't accurately reproduce your problem. The easiest way to ensure that would be to reuse.\n\nImplementor: If it's possible, I'd prefer not to change the 'brand' red upvoted color as it's core UI, though that's secondary to a functional UI. Or to say the reverse, maybe the best first approach would be to lighten the unvoted gray (though this may start looking like a disabled form element) or an outline.\n\n\nTo connect some context: \n\n#1494 is related and could be done with or separately from this fix. There is even an [insufficiently concerned](https://github.com/lobsters/lobsters/issues/1494#issuecomment-2740754925) comment from me that the proposal might not be accessible; I didn't consider the existing UI.\n\n#1090 is also about this UI but may be stale, I'll post more info there.", "I asked for help with this [in chat](https://lobste.rs/chat) and got a suggestion that's deploying now. I don't love the bold, but it is distinct, so we're good until we can come up with more attractive and functional UI.", "I used a random website - https://www.colorblindnesstest.org/color-tools/color-blindness-simulator/ - with \"achromatomaly\" mode. It is difficult to find the mode that would reflect my experience the best. In theory, I have protanomaly, that makes red shades appear less bright and \"green-ish\", but in practice, an image with \"protanomaly\" filter still looks somewhat different to an image without any filters. \"Achromatomaly\" mode looked right because I couldn't quite tell the difference between the image with this filter and without it under the light conditions I've had in my room at the moment. \n\nSide note: I feel like \"true tone\" setting set to \"On\" in MacOS might affect how I see colours. This is a default setting, so I prefer to keep it as is." ],

This increased use should bring more contributions as bug reports and feature proposals.\n\n### Regression test\n(Ensure the feature doesn't cause any regressions)\n- [ ] Write adequate test cases and submit test results\n- [ ] Test results should be reviewed by a person from the team\n\n### Links / references\n\n_Please note that this was taken from GitLab, to be changed accordingly_",

Write a brief description of how you will approach the task (without using ChatGPT).\n3. Add your Telegram handler in your application (e.g., in OnlyDust or similar)\n4. Write ETA in your application\n\n\n\n## What should I do if I have a problem\n1. Try to google it before asking. Googling is taking major part of dev work \n2. If you couldn't find answer your question with Google, text your question to [dev](https://t.me/spotnet_dev/4) group with your question.\n3. Do not send DM to maintainer, it would be better and faster to ask other contributors in chat \n\n\n## How to prepare PR\n1. Check if your code [smell](https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/smells) good\n2. Add `close #<issue number>` to link your issue with your PR\n3. Do not commit changes that are unrelated to your task\n4. Check after you created PR, if you committed everything\n\n\n## Task Description\n1. Add a new service to [`docker-compose.margin.yml`](./blob/main/devops/docker-compose.margin.yml) named `notification_bot`. Configure it to build using the `Dockerfile` located in the [`telegram`](./blob/main/margin/margin_app/app/telegram) directory.\n2. After building the Compose stack, share a screenshot showing that it completed successfully.",

      "description" : "## Guideline\n1. Carefully read the issue description before applying to ensure you have all the necessary information to start working on it.\n2. Write a brief description of how you will approach the task (without using ChatGPT).\n3. Add your Telegram handler in your application (e.g., in OnlyDust or similar)\n4. Write ETA in your application\n\n\n\n## What should I do if I have a problem\n1. Try to google it before asking. Googling is taking major part of dev work \n2. If you couldn't find answer your question with Google, text your question to [dev](https://t.me/spotnet_dev/4) group with your question.\n3. Do not send DM to maintainer, it would be better and faster to ask other contributors in chat \n\n\n## How to prepare PR\n1. Check if your code [smell](https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/smells) good\n2. Add `close #<issue number>` to link your issue with your PR\n3. Do not commit changes that are unrelated to your task\n4. Check after you created PR, if you committed everything\n\n\n## Task Description\n1. In the [handlers folder](./blob/main/margin/margin_app/app/telegram/handlers), create a new file named `admin.py`. Inside, add a handler called `/assets`. Use the [`Admin Filter` from this issue](https://github.com/djeck1432/spotnet/issues/915) to verify the user is an admin. Then, call the [`Assets statistic` method from this issue](https://github.com/djeck1432/spotnet/issues/906) to retrieve the data. Format the response using Telegram Markdown so it displays neatly.\n2. Provide a screenshot demonstrating that the handler works as expected.\n",

It makes sense for DagRun with multiple versions, but I don't think we should be able to explore DagVersions that are not part of the selected dagrun at all. \n\nIt makes it hard to follow when we start playing with the `version selector` when a DagRun is selected. (Is the DagVersion that I have selected part of the DagRun.dag_versions, or am I watching a completely unrelated structure)\n\n\nFor instance in the following image I have the `v2` structure displayed for a DagRun that actually only has `v4` part of his versions. The output graph doesn't make much sense.\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb45d6a5-514f-464e-b756-39c8b0a70c39)\n\n\nI do not know yet what is the best way to address this, any idea is welcome.\n### Committer\n\n- [x] I acknowledge that I am a maintainer/committer of the Apache Airflow project.",

That error is handled in a way that prevent the rest of the application to render and show a `Forbidden` page.\n\n~~We should instead fail gracefully and continue rendering the UI even if extra plugins menu items cannot be fetched because the user does not have access. This way user can still use the default UI.~~\n\nWe want all user to be able to see extra menu items coming from the plugins. We should add an entry in the [ui/config](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow-core/src/airflow/api_fastapi/core_api/routes/ui/config.py#L49) enpoints with `plugins_extra_menu_items` there (iterate over plugins `appbuilder_menu_items`), so all authenticated users can see them.

The directory includes artifacts that meet the CR requirements, along with PGP signatures for every file. I'm fairly sure, given the actual error below, that the artifacts themselves don't matter.\n\nI have the following `jreleaser.toml`:\n\n```\n[deploy.maven.mavenCentral.sonatype]\nactive = \"ALWAYS\"\nsign = false\nurl = \"https://central.sonatype.com/api/v1/publisher\"\nstagingRepositories = [\"build/maven\"]\n```\n\nI run jreleaser:\n\n```\n$ env \\\nJRELEASER_MAVENCENTRAL_USERNAME=\"${MAVEN_CENTRAL_USERNAME}\" \\\nJRELEASER_MAVENCENTRAL_PASSWORD=\"${MAVEN_CENTRAL_PASSWORD}\" \\\nJRELEASER_PROJECT_JAVA_GROUP_ID=\"${JRELEASER_PROJECT_JAVA_GROUP_ID}\" \\\nJRELEASER_PROJECT_VERSION=\"${JRELEASER_PROJECT_VERSION}\" \\\n./jreleaser deploy --config-file=jreleaser.toml\n```\n\n### Expected Behaviour\n\nI'd expect to see `jreleaser` create a bundle and deploy it to Maven Central.\n\n### Actual Behaviour\n\n```\n[INFO]  JReleaser
