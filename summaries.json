However, the `ccusage blocks --live` monitor in the terminal shows the session ending at a different time (8 PM in the attached screenshot).\n\nThis difference can be a bit confusing as it's not clear which timer to follow. Could you please clarify if this is the expected behavior?\n\n#### **Steps to Observe the Behavior**\n1. On macOS with the latest version of VS Code.\n2. Have the Claude Code extension installed.\n3. In the VS Code integrated terminal, run the command `ccusage@latest blocks --live`.\n4. The time displayed by the extension in the editor's top bar (\"resets at 6pm\") differs from the \"Remaining\" time in the `ccusage` monitor (e.g., shows end time of 8:00:00 PM).\n\n#### **My Expectation**\nFor clarity, I would expect both timers to be synchronized and reflect the actual session end time.\n\n#### **Screenshots**\nAs shown in the screenshot, the top right of the IDE indicates a reset time of 6 PM, while the `ccusage` session monitor in the terminal shows a session end time of 8 PM.\n\n#### **Environment**\n* **OS:** macOS\n* **IDE:** Visual Studio Code (Latest Version)\n* **Tool:** `ccusage@latest`\n* **Extension Name & Version:** Claude Code `[Please add extension version if known]`\n\nThank you for looking into this.　",

It's not an issue of implementation, it's a bug in nodetool syntax that makes this case ambiguous and nodetool has no idea what the user intended.\r\n\r\n> Since the key is passed over an http-based interface I suggest to allow encoding `:` characters using the standard http encoding as `%3A` substrings (`seastar::http::internal::url_decode` can be used to decode such strings).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if that was your intention, but such encoding (which obviously has to happen when building the REST API URL), will not help to differentiate whether \"a:b\" is two components or one with a colon. Also, if the nodetool API is already ambgious (what does the \"a:b\" the user passed mean?) there is no way that additional encoding can fix it.\r\n\r\nIf you change anything in this area, please don't forget to add tests.", "From the api standpoint what I had in mind is to pass `key=a%3Ab` if the non-composite key (or one of its components) contains `:`.\r\nThe user can pass that to nodetool as well.\r\n\r\nThat said, allowing passing multiple components as request parameters is possible too, though with the current interface it is not intuitive to assume that the multiple key parameters indicate multiple components of a composite key rather than multiple keys, if the API supported returning the natural endpoints for multiple keys.\r\n\r\nNote that `%3A` is supported for `keyspace:table` \"tuples\" when passed as a single parameter or as a comma-separated list of `keyspace:table`, to support keyspace or table names containing `:`.", "> From the api standpoint what I had in mind is to pass `key=a%3Ab` if the non-composite key (or one of its components) contains `:`. The user can pass that to nodetool as well.\r\n\r\n`key=a%3Ab` is the url-encoded form of setting key to `a:b`. But now that Scylla receives it, how does it know if this was intended to be a string key `a:b` or two components?\r\n\r\nMaybe you were thinking of encoding **twice**? If that's the case, the first layer of encoding doesn't need to be URL encoding. Just the outer layer of encoding must be.\r\n\r\nAre you sure about what you said about `keyspace:table` allowing real \":\"? Last time I checked, I found that at least in one context, you are only allowed to have colons in the table name, not keyspace name (e.g., in Alternator GSI), and what happens is simply that Scylla splits only on the first colon, so `xyz:abc:qwe` means that `xyz` is the keyspace, `abc:qwe` is the table.

This seems to require constant back and forth renaming step.\n\nWould be nice, if configuration supported \"<lingo.dev locale>: <file name locale>\" mapping possibility. Ideally on bucket level (below) but having it on global level would be already a win if you don't have more than one file format. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"version\": 1.2,\n  \"locale\": {\n    \"source\": \"en\",\n    \"targets\": [\n      \"ar-EG\",\n      \"bg\",\n      \"nb-NO\",\n      \"sr-Latn-RS\",\n      \"zh-Hant\",\n      \"zh-Hans\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"buckets\": {\n    \"xcode-strings\": {\n      \"include\": [\n        {\n        \"path\": \"[locale].strings\",\n        \"delimiter\": \"_\"\n        \"locale\": {\n          \"source\": \"en\",\n          \"targets\": {\n            \"ar-EG\": \"ar\",\n            \"bg\",\n            \"nb-NO\": \"nb\",\n            \"pt-BR\": \"pt\"\n            \"sr-Latn-RS\": \"sr-Latn\",\n            \"zh-Hant\",\n            \"zh-Hans\": \"zh\"\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  \"$schema\": \"https://lingo.dev/schema/i18n.json\"\n}\n```\n\nSo the conf like this would read files with local file patterns and give me back:\n\n- ar.strings\n- bg.strings\n- nb.strings\n- pt.strings\n- sr_Latn.strings\n- zh_Hant.strings\n- zh.strings\n\nPS. Whether to require \"delimiter\" or allow this be set also here, no opinion...\n",

We should fix this in 2.1 so there is an `approximation_degree` on the cancellation pass that internally passes it to the analysis and we use that in the preset pass managers, I'll convert this comment into an issue.\n\n_Originally posted by @mtreinish in https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/pull/14021#discussion_r2017641853_\n\nThe `CommutativeCancellation` pass internally calls `CommutationAnalysis` which takes an approximation degree parameter. But we don't expose this argument via commutative cancellation. We should fix this oversight and add the argument to commutative cancellation and then wire it up so setting `approximation_degree` in a preset pass manager passes it through to commutation analysis.\n            ",

While the existing `lookup` command performs comprehensive object retrieval including WebFinger, there are many cases where users only want to test WebFinger configuration. This command takes a `@user@domain` handle as an argument and outputs only the WebFinger result (JRD) in JSON format.\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n- Create a new `webfinger.ts` file in the CLI directory, using `lookup.ts` as a reference\n- Utilize the existing `lookupWebFinger()` function from the Fedify library\n- Add the new command to `mod.ts` to register it with the CLI\n- Output results in clean JSON format for easy parsing\n- Handle WebFinger-specific errors appropriately\n\n## Why This Is a Good First Issue\n\n- **Independent feature**: Add new functionality without modifying existing code\n- **Learn structure**: Experience the complete process of adding a new CLI command\n- **Code reuse**: Great example of leveraging existing Fedify library functions\n- **Focused scope**: Single-purpose command with clear input/output expectations\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Create `fedify webfinger <handle>` command\n- [ ] Accept `@user@domain` format handles as input\n- [ ] Output WebFinger JRD results in JSON format\n- [ ] Handle invalid handles and WebFinger lookup failures gracefully\n- [ ] Register the command in the CLI module system\n- [ ] Add appropriate help text and usage examples\n\n## Files to Create/Modify\n\n- `cli/webfinger.ts` - New command implementation\n- `cli/mod.ts` - Register the new command\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```bash\nfedify webfinger @user@example.com\nfedify webfinger @mastodon@mastodon.social\n```",

These extras are needed by the MSSQL hook, but we cannot blindly accept these will work in pymssql connections.\n\nExample connection:\n```json\n{\n  \"conn_type\": \"mssql\",\n  \"extra\": {\n    \"driver\": \"ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server\",\n    \"encrypt\": \"yes\",\n    \"sqlalchemy_scheme\": \"mssql+pyodbc\"\n  },\n    \"host\": \"xxx\",\n    \"login\": \"xxx\",\n    \"password\": \"xxx\",\n    \"port\": 1433,\n    \"schema\": \"master\"\n}\n```\n\nErrors when using an SQLQueryExecutor using the above connection:\n\n```python\nFile \"src/pymssql/_pymssql.pyx\", line 586, in pymssql._pymssql.connect\nTypeError: connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'driver'\n\nFile \"src/pymssql/_pymssql.pyx\", line 586, in pymssql._pymssql.connect\nTypeError: connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'encrypt'\n```\n\n### What you think should happen instead\n\nThese conenctions should continue working as they did in `apache-airflow-providers-microsoft-mssql==3.9.2`\n\n### How to reproduce\n\nHave MSSQL connections defined with `extra` parameters\nInstall `apache-airflow-providers-microsoft-mssql` >= 4.0.0\nTry an mssql hook using sqlalchemy\n\n### Anything else\n\n_No response_\n\n### Are you willing to submit PR?\n\n- [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n",

I may have a look at fixing it, but not really sure what's the best way. Reverting the change, or adding an error checking for extras that are not supported in pymssql, or some other option..", "@emredjan \nInstead of expanding `MsSqlHook` to accept ODBC-specific options, why not lean on the hooks that already match each driver?\n\n- **pymssql → `MsSqlHook`**  \n  The hook defaults to the `mssql+pymssql` dialect and is tuned for that stack.\n- **pyodbc → `OdbcHook`**  \n  `OdbcHook` uses `pyodbc` under the hood and already exposes a `driver` parameter via connection extras/hook params, so no extra work is needed.\n\nKeeping the hooks focused means:\n1. We avoid adding more branching logic to `MsSqlHook`.\n2. Users choose the hook that matches their driver, which is consistent with how other database providers work.\n\nWhat’s your take? Assuming that's reasonable, would you be open to switching to [`OdbcHook`](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-odbc/stable/_api/airflow/providers/odbc/hooks/odbc/index.html) and resolving this issue?" ],

      "description" : "In Kamaji, the default preferred `NodeAddressTypes` for the API server to connect to Kubelets is currently configured as: \n```\n--kubelet-preferred-address-types=Hostname,InternalIP,ExternalIP\n```\nSee: [github.com/clastix/kamaji/api/v1alpha1/tenantcontrolplane_types.go#L71](https://github.com/clastix/kamaji/blob/3fd1882e435a087a1234e3b0f011bebde265aea9/api/v1alpha1/tenantcontrolplane_types.go#L71)\n<br>\n\nThis makes `Hostname` the first preference for the API server when connecting to nodes for Kubelet(`Hostname:KubeletPort`) for operations like `kubectl logs`, `exec`, `port-forward`, and more. \n<br>\n\n### Why this causes issues\nIf the node hostname is not resolvable with the DNS server, the operations fail with errors like:\n```\ndial tcp: lookup node1 on 10.96.0.10:53: no such host\n```\n\nThis happens because:\n* The API server tries to resolve the node’s hostname via CoreDNS (typically `10.96.0.10:53`).\n* CoreDNS forwards the query to the external DNS configured in `/etc/resolv.conf` (since CoreDNS itself does not have entries for node names by default).\n* If the external DNS does not have records for these node hostnames, the lookup fails and API server → kubelet connection is broken.\n\nIn some environments, such as certain cloud providers or corporate networks where hostnames are registered in external DNS, this may work. However, relying on external DNS having entries for your nodes introduces fragility and environment-specific dependency.\n<br>\n\n### Proposal\n**Kubeadm defaults to**:\n```\n--kubelet-preferred-address-types=InternalIP,ExternalIP,Hostname\n```\nThis prioritizes `InternalIP`, which is routable inside the cluster or VPC, avoiding DNS resolution issues for node hostnames.\n\nTherefore update Kamaji’s default `preferredAddressTypes` to:\n```\n--kubelet-preferred-address-types=InternalIP,ExternalIP,Hostname\n```\nThis change reduces dependency on external DNS or custom CoreDNS configuration and provides better out-of-the-box reliability for most environments, especially on-prem or private clouds where nodes have valid InternalIPs but hostnames may not be resolvable via CoreDNS or external DNS.\n\nFurthermore, if nodes are in separate private networks and the API server cannot directly reach their `InternalIP`, Konnectivity can be deployed to establish reliable connectivity (Konnectivity is enabled by default in Kamaji TCP pods).\n\n### Changes\n- Update the default value of `TenantControlPlane.Spec.Kubernetes.Kubelet.PreferredAddressTypes` to:\n`\"InternalIP,ExternalIP,Hostname\"`.\n- Update the default value of `KamajiControlPlane.Spec.Kubelet.PreferredAddressTypes` to: \n`\"InternalIP,ExternalIP,Hostname\"`.",

And to avoid triggering `noEmptyBlock` this should even be `{ return; }`, `{ ; }`, or `{ /* undefined value */ }` that look hacky.", "@Conaclos I agree. ", "Actually I even wonder if we should not always allow `return undefined`. This is a bit a stretch, however I find that `retrun;` and `return undefined;` convey different meaning: the first indicates an early return in a function that doesn't return any value (`fn(): void`), while the second one indicates a function that explicitly return the `undefined` value (`fn(): something | undefined`).\nFor example cases like this looks totally fine to me:\n\n```js\nexport function literalVal(literal: Literal): LiteralVal {\n    switch (literal.type) {\n        case \"bigint\":\n            return BigInt(literal.val)\n        case \"number\":\n        case \"string\":\n            return literal.val\n        case \"false\":\n            return false\n        case \"null\":\n            return null\n        case \"true\":\n            return true\n        case \"undefined\":\n            return undefined\n    }\n}\n```\n\nHowever, this could make the rule very different from its unicorn source.\n\nAlso, `useGetterReturn` doesn't accept `return;`, only `return <something>`, including `return undefined` that got flagged by `noUselessUndefined`.", "Yes, I also agree to that. So, noUselessUndefined would only check parameters I guess. " ],

      "description" : "Part of #12048\n\n## Issue\nAfter most of the Unit Test migration in #12048, there are a lot of inconsistencies in access control test methods. This is because we did not migrate the many convenient, abstracted, and commonly used access control test methods from `ui/webapi/BaseActionTest.java` to `sqlui/webapi/BaseActionTest.java`.\n\nAfter merging #13254, all of the access control test methods in `BaseActionTest.java` have been migrated. Hence, this issue aims to refactor the unit test access controls to use these convenient test methods.\n\n## Progress\nThe progress for this refactoring can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IcB-viJMrIOknYoBYasBuRBK9qnwY0-doEK4_Eb24IA/edit?gid=0#gid=0).\n\n## Steps to Contribute\n\n1. Choose test(s) to work on in the above Google Sheets link, and comment on this issue to indicate that you'd like to contribute on the chosen test(s).\n2. Create a PR to refactor the unit test(s).\n3. Submit the PR, with a link to this issue by starting the description with \"Part of #13304\"\n\n## Tips\n\n- Understand the access control test methods in `sqlui/webapi/BaseActionTest.java`, follow the refactoring in #13254\n- Most of the access control testing logic in the migrated unit tests under `sqlui/webapi` follows the old unit tests under `ui/webapi`, so you may wish to reference the old unit test for help",

      "description" : "### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.\n\nAdjusting numbers for which there is no-direct input control is tedious; Numbers must be entered manually or increased/decreased with the arrow keys. \n\n(Direct input control would be positioning by drag and drop; no direct input control is anything that needs to be changes in the GUI and not on the canvas, like opacity or blur)\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\n\nAllow drag-to-change-value on numeric input fields. This means if you mousedown in an input field and drag right the value is increased, if you drag left, the value is decreased (for left-to-right languages at least, otherwise protentially reversed). The amount of value change is proportional to the drag distance (as if you would drag an invisible slider which is initially positioned at the drag start point)\n\n* Figma has a working solution on this if you want to see it in action:\n![animation: drag on numerical control to change number](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3416487/196199679-3c467e25-227c-4220-922d-844361d97757.gif)\n\n\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\n\n* #1831 describes using something like GIMPs numeric controls which are similar to sliders which are more easy to hit with the mouse. This needs far more space than a single numberical control, though. The OP mentiones the solution described here in a comment. \n* Just having the conventional Up/down mini-arrows would enable mouse interaction for what is now up/down arrow keys: ![up/down mini buttons for numerical input](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3416487/196196695-5540f915-19a0-495a-a7e9-de8cb215bcd8.png)\n\n\n### Additional context\n* Via Casey Dalbo’s reply to [this penpot thread](https://twitter.com/CaseyDalbo/status/1581987007818911744)",

Maybe I'll have some more time in a week or so, but maybe not, so I'm leaving this here in case someone wants to give it a go in a few weeks: ask first because I will have some usable code.\n\n* The way that cursors are handled overall makes it so that as soon as one moves out of the input field, it is reset to whatever (e.g. the custom arrow in the canvas), which is very ugly. One fix would be to keep a global cursor stream and use that in every component that currently sets the cursor locally.\n* Each in/decrement of the field triggers an update for the undo stack, immediately making it unusable with hundreds of changes. This follows the behaviour with the mouse wheel, but we should change that too: updates should be grouped and made into atomic changes. Both can be addressed at the same time.", "Just an update for the record while we work on merging #6635 \n\n> * The way that cursors are handled ...\n\nAfter implementing pointer warping (i.e. pop it on the opposite side of the window when we hit the border, as if it moved over a torus) this is solved because the default pointer is hidden by the browser when capturing it (which is required for the warping)\n\n> * Each in/decrement of the field triggers an update for the undo stack ...\n\nThis is solved with a wrapper component `transactional-input*`, a strategy hopefully useful for other components as well" ],

      "description" : "### Bug description\n\nWhen configuring dashboard filters with the \"Values are dependent on other filters\" option, the system prevents creating bi-directional dependencies upfront by showing a \"Cyclic dependency detected\" message. However, it allows creating the same dependency indirectly after saving the initial filter configuration.\n\n1. If Filter A is set to depend on Filter B, the system blocks setting Filter B to depend on Filter A immediately, showing a \"Cyclic dependency detected\" message.\n2. However, if Filter A is saved with the dependency on Filter B, the system later allows editing Filter B to create the reverse dependency, effectively forming a bi-directional (cyclic) dependency.\n\nThis behavior is inconsistent and might lead to unexpected filter behavior. It appears to contradict the intended prevention of cyclic dependencies.\nHow to reproduce the bug\n\n1. Create a dashboard filter (e.g., Filter A) with a dependency on another filter (e.g., Filter B) by enabling the Values are dependent on other filters option.\n2. Save the filter configuration.\n3. Open the dashboard filter configuration again, select Filter B, and set it to depend on Filter A.\n4. Save the changes.\n\n## Expected results\n\nThe system should prevent bi-directional (cyclic) dependencies for all filter types, not just date filters. Users should not be able to create a cyclic dependency by editing the filters after saving the initial configuration.\n\n## Actual results\n\nThe platform allows creating cyclic dependencies indirectly after the initial configuration, even though it prevents it upfront. This behavior is inconsistent and may lead to unexpected filter behavior.\n\n### Screenshots/recordings\n\n_No response_\n\n### Superset version\n\nmaster / latest-dev\n\n### Python version\n\n3.11\n\n### Node version\n\n18 or greater\n\n### Browser\n\nChrome\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Checklist\n\n- [x] I have searched Superset docs and Slack and didn't find a solution to my problem.\n- [x] I have searched the GitHub issue tracker and didn't find a similar bug report.\n- [x] I have checked Superset's logs for errors and if I found a relevant Python stacktrace, I included it here as text in the \"additional context\" section.",

The one section I've noticed in particular is the discussion about running CI checks locally as part of the PR submission process; there may be others.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nConsolidate these docs upstream (on the beeware.org website) so that the content isn't duplicated unnecessarily. However, developing a good narrative flow with an external site like that may be complex.\n\n### Additional context\n\nSee also https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1696, https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/2453.",

Identify and fix common pylint errors and warnings\n2. Increase the overall pylint score from current level to at least 7.5\n3. Standardize code quality across the codebase\n\n## Proposed Tasks\n- [ ] Address unused imports and variables (typically detected by C0410, W0611)\n- [ ] Fix line length issues to comply with PEP 8 (79 characters)\n- [ ] Add missing docstrings to modules, classes, and functions\n- [ ] Fix poor variable naming and code style issues\n\n1. First fix all error-level issues (--errors-only)\n2. Then address warning-level issues\n3. Finally work on convention and refactor messages",

This sends the current terminal session into a \"running server\" mode and stops any further actions from q chat as it loses control over the terminal. Typing \"y\" or using \"enter\" do not affect anything. When using \"CTRL+C\", chat loses the chain of thought\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nAsk to create a python flask application and then ask chat to debug the website to see if it works.\n\n<img width=\"796\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7339d3e-238b-48f1-8302-e773b042117b\" />\n\n### Environment\n\n```yaml\n[q-details]\nversion = \"1.7.2\"\nhash = \"b6bf5f1675dd7395009e8bc65c1145820671f211\"\ndate = \"2025-03-21T01:36:16.66764Z (19h ago)\"\nvariant = \"full\"\n\n[system-info]\nos = \"macOS 15.3.1 (24D70)\"\nchip = \"Apple M1 Pro\"\ntotal-cores = 10\nmemory = \"32.00 GB\"\n\n[environment]\ncwd = \"/Users/USER/Documents/aws/samples/q chat/personalize-casino-demo\"\ncli-path = \"/Users/USER/Documents/aws/samples/q chat/personalize-casino-demo\"\nos = \"Mac\"\nshell-path = \"/bin/zsh\"\nshell-version = \"5.9\"\nterminal = \"VSCode\"\ninstall-method = \"unknown\"\n\n[env-vars]\nPATH = \"/Users/USER/Documents/aws/samples/q chat/personalize-casino-demo/venv/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.12/bin:/usr/local/bin:/System/Cryptexes/App/usr/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/var/run/com.apple.security.cryptexd/codex.system/bootstrap/usr/local/bin:/var/run/com.apple.security.cryptexd/codex.system/bootstrap/usr/bin:/var/run/com.apple.security.cryptexd/codex.system/bootstrap/usr/appleinternal/bin:/Users/USER/.vscode/extensions/ms-python.python-2025.2.0-darwin-arm64/python_files/deactivate/zsh:/Users/USER/.pyenv/versions/3.8.12/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.12/bin:/Users/USER/.local/bin\"\nQTERM_SESSION_ID = \"38b2f8a58ec548a8b6e711aa74579a77\"\nQ_SET_PARENT_CHECK = \"1\"\nQ_TERM = \"1.7.1\"\nSHELL = \"/bin/zsh\"\nTERM = \"xterm-256color\"\nZDOTDIR = \"/Users/USER\"\n__CFBundleIdentifier = \"com.microsoft.VSCode\"\n```",

      "comments" : [ "<!-- Answer -->\nThis issue is caused by a disconnect between the context available to Jinja templates during regular chart rendering and what is provided during drill-to-detail actions. When you drill, the frontend sends a new request that often lacks the full dashboard/global context (like dashboard filters or URL params) that your Jinja SQL expects, so the template renders incorrectly or with missing values. This is a known limitation and has been discussed in several issues and code reviews ([example](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/33591), [example](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/33579)).\n\nA workaround is to make your Jinja SQL more robust by using `if/else` blocks to provide default values when filters are missing, so the query always returns results and columns don't disappear. For example:\n\n```sql\nWITH calculation as (\n  SELECT count(*), country\n  FROM \"Vehicle Sales\"\n  WHERE 1=1\n  {% if filter_values('product_line') %}\n    and product_line in {{ filter_values('product_line')|where_in }}\n  {% else %}\n    and product_line = 'Classic Cars'\n  {% endif %}\n  GROUP BY country\n)\nSELECT * FROM calculation\n```\n([source](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/33591))\n\nIf your dataset relies on dashboard-level filters or variables, you may need to adjust your Jinja logic to handle cases where those are missing during drill actions.\n\nThere have also been recent changes to how Superset syncs dataset columns and processes Jinja templates, which can impact this behavior ([PR 30903](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/30903)). Make sure your configuration enables `ENABLE_TEMPLATE_PROCESSING` and that your feature flags are up to date.\n\nAt this time, there is no full workaround for preserving all dashboard context in drill-to-detail requests, but making your Jinja SQL more defensive can help avoid empty or broken results.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

Actually, the reason this issue is still open is because this is an ongoing effort. We migrated to C++11 about a year ago, but a lot of the code base is still in C++98 style (definitely most of the code that was written more than a year ago). For example: we don't always use `auto` where needed, we still use `std::map` where we could use `std::unordered_map`, we don't use range-based loops in many cases, etc. We could use your help with those.\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned above - we don't expect a huge PR that fixes all of these things. We actually prefer small PRs that make incremental fixes, and we hope that we can slowly migrate as much of the code as possible.\r\n\r\nIt'd be really great if you can help.

Add UI for selecting/mapping tags in the import workflow (similar to account handling)\n  3. Add tag parsing to ImportActivitiesService for CSV/JSON imports\n  4. Update template to include tag selector component in the import dialog \n\nThe implementation would mirror how account handling works in the current import flow.

The idea is to handle the tag processing entirely on the backend, similar to how it's currently done for accounts during import.

Implement language detection using an existing library (e.g., `langdetect`, `lingua-py`, or `fasttext`)\n2. Add language detection as an optional feature that can be enabled in `ExtractionConfig`\n3. When enabled, automatically detect language and configure OCR backend accordingly\n4. Support detection from both extracted text and pre-OCR image analysis\n5. Add caching for language detection results to avoid redundant processing\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n- Add new optional dependency group `[language-detection]` in `pyproject.toml`:\n  ```toml\n  optional-dependencies.language-detection = [\n    \"fast-langdetect>=0.2.0\",  # 80x faster than langdetect, 95% accuracy\n  ]\n  ```\n- **Library Choice Rationale**: Use `fast-langdetect` based on 2024 benchmarks showing it's 80x faster than alternatives while maintaining 95% accuracy\n- Add `auto_detect_language: bool = False` to `ExtractionConfig`\n- Add `detected_languages: list[str] | None` to `ExtractionResult`\n- Create new module `kreuzberg/_language_detection.py` with detection logic\n- Update OCR backends to use detected language when available\n- Handle `MissingDependencyError` when language detection is enabled but library not installed\n\n**Testing Requirements:**\n- Test language detection with documents in multiple languages\n- Test fallback behavior when detection fails\n- Test integration with each OCR backend\n- Test caching behavior\n- Mock the language detection library in unit tests\n- Add test files in different languages to `test_source_files/`\n\n**Example Usage:**\n```python\nconfig = ExtractionConfig(auto_detect_language=True)\nresult = await extract_file(\"document.pdf\", config=config)\nprint(f\"Detected languages: {result.detected_languages}\")\n```",

The tool I use for accessing file content, `read_file`, does not currently support processing audio formats like .mp3.\n>\n> When you referenced `@VO.mp3`, the `read_file` tool attempted to access it and returned the message: \"Cannot display content of binary file\". I received only that error message, not the audio data itself. Therefore, the limitation is not in my analytical capability but in the data ingestion mechanism of the tools available in my current environment.",

Forked and cloned the repository, then searched the codebase for `readline` usage to find the core input handling logic.\n2.  Identified `useKeypress.ts` (for raw keypress events) and `InputPrompt.tsx` (for input logic) as the key files.\n3.  To see what the application receives, I temporarily modified the code to log every keypress event to a `debug.log` file.\n4.  **Key Finding:** My initial debugging proved that on a default macOS Terminal, `Shift+Enter` sends the exact same sequence (`\\r`) as a regular `Enter` press, making the two indistinguishable.\n\n### Attempted Fix & The Final Discovery\n\nBased on the initial finding, I attempted a code-only fix by teaching the application to listen for a different key combination, `Shift+Down`, which often sends a unique sequence on other terminals.\n\n1. The Code I Tested\nI modified `useKeypress.ts` to listen for the `Shift+Down` sequence (`\\x1b[1;2B`) and `InputPrompt.tsx` to handle a `key.shift` flag.\n\n```typescript\n// In useKeypress.ts, I added a check:\nif (key.sequence === '\\x1b[1;2B') {\n  key.name = 'return';\n  key.shift = true;\n}\n```\n```typescript\n// In InputPrompt.tsx, I added the key.shift check:\nif (key.ctrl || key.meta || key.shift || charBefore === '\\\\' || key.paste) {\n  // ... newline logic\n}\n```\n\n2. The Result: It Also Failed\nThis proof-of-concept did not work. To understand why, I used the `cat` command to see what my terminal was actually sending when I pressed `Shift+Down`.\nFinal Proof: The terminal sent `^[[B`, which is the standard escape code for a plain Cursor Down key.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis investigation leads to a definitive conclusion: the default macOS Terminal is more limited than anticipated. It appears to strip the `Shift` modifier information from both the `Enter` key and the arrow keys, making a code-only fix for a `Shift+Key` newline combination unfeasible on this specific platform, although i think this might work on other platforms which by default register shift + down as '\\x1b[1;2B' but i cant really test it.\n\nThis might explain why `Ctrl+J` is a common suggested alternative, as it sends a universal newline character (`\\n`) that doesn't rely on modifier key parsing.\n\nAs this is my first contribution, my analysis could be wrong, and I apologize for the detailed-but-failed attempt. Given these findings, what is the desired path forward? Any information from the internal `b.corp.google.com` link about how other terminals are supported would still be very helpful.\n\nThank you for your time and guidance.", "Just to add, I personally use the Warp Terminal on Mac.

      "description" : "### Describe the bug\n\nHello,\n\nI'm currently working with scikit-learn version 1.6, and I encountered a regression that wasn't present in version 1.4.\n\nThe following minimal code computes two features — the cumulative mean of age and weight grouped by id. Each transformation function returns a pandas.Series:\n\n\n\nWhen I run this code with scikit-learn 1.6, I get the following error:\n\nAfter investigation, I found that the issue occurs because each transformer returns a Series, not a DataFrame. If I update the functions to return DataFrame objects instead, the error disappears.\n\nInterestingly, in scikit-learn 1.4, the same code works correctly even when the functions return Series.\n\n\nDo you have any explanation for why this changed between version 1.4 and 1.6 ?\n\nThanks in advance for your help!\n\n### Steps/Code to Reproduce\n\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import FunctionTransformer, FeatureUnion\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef compute_cumulative_mean_age(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:\n    return (\n        df[\"age\"]\n        .astype(float)\n        .groupby(df[\"id\"])\n        .expanding()\n        .mean()\n        .droplevel(level=\"id\")\n        .reindex(df.index)\n        .rename(\"cumulative_mean_age\")\n    )\n\ndef compute_cumulative_mean_weight(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:\n    return (\n        df[\"poids\"]\n        .astype(float)\n        .groupby(df[\"id\"])\n        .expanding()\n        .mean()\n        .droplevel(level=\"id\")\n        .reindex(df.index)\n        .rename(\"cumulative_mean_weight\")\n    )\n\ndef compute_features(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:\n    feature_union = FeatureUnion(\n        [\n            (\"cumulative_mean_age\", FunctionTransformer(compute_cumulative_mean_age)),\n            (\"cumulative_mean_weight\", FunctionTransformer(compute_cumulative_mean_weight))\n        ]\n    ).set_output(transform=\"pandas\")\n\n    return feature_union.fit_transform(X=df).astype(float)\n\ndef transform(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:\n    return compute_features(df)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    np.random.seed(42)\n    df = pd.DataFrame({\n        'id': [1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8],\n        'age': np.random.randint(18, 70, size=10),\n        'poids': np.random.randint(50, 100, size=10)\n    })\n\n    print(transform(df))\n```\n\n### Expected Results\n\n```pytb\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"C:\\Users\\XXX\\PycharmProjects\\fraude_detection_pec_audio\\tmp.py\", line 73, in <module>\n    print(transform(df=df))\n          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"C:\\Users\\XXX\\PycharmProjects\\fraude_detection_pec_audio\\tmp.py\", line 55, in transform\n    return compute_features(\n           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"C:\\Users\\XXX\\PycharmProjects\\fraude_detection_pec_audio\\tmp.py\", line 45, in compute_features\n    .fit_transform(\n     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"C:\\Users\\XXX\\PycharmProjects\\fraude_detection_pec_audio\\.venv\\Lib\\site-packages\\sklearn\\utils\\_set_output.py\", line 332, in wrapped\n    return _wrap_data_with_container(method, data_to_wrap, X, self)\n           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"C:\\Users\\XXX\\PycharmProjects\\fraude_detection_pec_audio\\.venv\\Lib\\site-packages\\sklearn\\utils\\_set_output.py\", line 307, in _wrap_data_with_container\n    return adapter.create_container(\n           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"C:\\Users\\XXX\\PycharmProjects\\fraude_detection_pec_audio\\.venv\\Lib\\site-packages\\sklearn\\utils\\_set_output.py\", line 135, in create_container\n    X_output = _create_pandas_dataframe_from_non_pandas_container(\n               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"C:\\Users\\XXX\\PycharmProjects\\fraude_detection_pec_audio\\.venv\\Lib\\site-packages\\sklearn\\utils\\fixes.py\", line 428, in _create_pandas_dataframe_from_non_pandas_container\n    return pd.DataFrame(X, index=index, copy=copy)\n           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"C:\\Users\\XXX\\PycharmProjects\\fraude_detection_pec_audio\\.venv\\Lib\\site-packages\\pandas\\core\\frame.py\", line 722, in __init__\n    mgr = ndarray_to_mgr(\n          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"C:\\Users\\XXX\\PycharmProjects\\fraude_detection_pec_audio\\.venv\\Lib\\site-packages\\pandas\\core\\internals\\construction.py\", line 349, in ndarray_to_mgr\n    _check_values_indices_shape_match(values, index, columns)\n  File \"C:\\Users\\XXX\\PycharmProjects\\fraude_detection_pec_audio\\.venv\\Lib\\site-packages\\pandas\\core\\internals\\construction.py\", line 420, in _check_values_indices_shape_match\n    raise ValueError(f\"Shape of passed values is {passed}, indices imply {implied}\")\nValueError: Shape of passed values is (20, 1), indices imply (10, 1)\n```\n\n### Actual Results\n\n```pytb\n    raise ValueError(f\"Shape of passed values is {passed}, indices imply {implied}\")\nValueError: Shape of passed values is (20, 1), indices imply (10, 1)\n```\n\n### Versions\n\n```shell\nsklearn: 1.6.0\nnumpy: 1.26.4\npandas: 1.5.3\n```",

      "comments" : [ "I would argue that the previous beahviour worked by chance but it was a bug. Scikit-learn transformers API expect to return an array of shape `(n_samples, n_features)`. Having a single dimension is really ambiguous because we cannot guess if it is a single sample or a single feature. For instance, if you use `set_output(transform=\"default\")`, then you will get an array of shape `(20,)` where I would argue that the `FeatureUnion` failed.\n\nSo here, I think that the fact that we raise an error is actually fine. The error message is a bit tricky thought. The fact it does not raise with `set_output(transform=\"default\")` is actually annoying I think.\n\nSo one way would be to validate the output of `FunctionTransformer` being sure it should be 2-D. However, we sometime want this transformer to be lenient so I wonder if the behaviour should be driven by a parameter, similarly to the `validate` parameter but for the output.", "@jeremiedbb @ogrisel do you have any thoughts regarding if `FunctionTransformer` should be permissive regarding the shape of the output or if we should strictly follow the API of other transformers.\n\nI'm thinking that we usually want this transformer to be permissive on the input side.", "Note that the mentioned code already raises 2 informative warnings before raising the final exception:\n\n```python\n/Users/ogrisel/code/scikit-learn/sklearn/preprocessing/_function_transformer.py:311: UserWarning: When `set_output` is configured to be 'pandas', `func` should return a pandas DataFrame to follow the `set_output` API  or `feature_names_out` should be defined.\n  warnings.warn(warn_msg.format(\"pandas\"))\n/Users/ogrisel/code/scikit-learn/sklearn/preprocessing/_function_transformer.py:311: UserWarning: When `set_output` is configured to be 'pandas', `func` should return a pandas DataFrame to follow the `set_output` API  or `feature_names_out` should be defined.\n  warnings.warn(warn_msg.format(\"pandas\"))\n```\n\nThe function transformer should not return a pandas series but a pandas dataframe.\n\nMaybe we could change this to accept series and automatically wrap them as dataframes because there is no ambiguity in this particular case.\n\nIf not, I agree that we should at least improve the error message.\n\nLet me try to simplify the reproducer to make it minimal.", "Here is a minimal reproducer:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import FunctionTransformer\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import FeatureUnion\n\n\ndata = pd.DataFrame(dict(a=range(3), b=range(3)))\nFeatureUnion(\n    [\n        (\"a\", FunctionTransformer(lambda df: df[\"a\"])),\n        (\"b\", FunctionTransformer(lambda df: df[\"b\"])),  # exception not raised if you remove this line.\n    ]\n).set_output(transform=\"pandas\").fit_transform(data)\n```\n\nNote that the `FeatureUnion` requires 2 series, otherwise there are no exceptions, only the warnings.", "Actually, here is the real bug in my opinion: if you remove the `.set_output(\"pandas\")` from the above snippet, the code works without failing or raising warnings but outputs meaningless results:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import FunctionTransformer\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import FeatureUnion\n\n\ndata = pd.DataFrame(dict(a=range(3), b=range(3)))\nFeatureUnion(\n    [\n        (\"a\", FunctionTransformer(lambda df: df[\"a\"])),\n        (\"b\", FunctionTransformer(lambda df: df[\"b\"])),\n    ]\n).fit_transform(data)\n```\n```\narray([0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2])\n```\n\nInstead, `FeatureUnion` should raise an explicit error message to make it explicit that some transformers output 1d data-structures instead of the expected 2d.", "I think the `FeatureUnion._hstack` method should be changed to raise an informative error message if some elements in `Xs` are not 2D data-structures. We should also check that their `.shape[0]` match the expected number of samples measured on the `X` parameter passed to `FeatureUnion.transform` or `FeatureUnion.fit_transform`.\n\nEDIT: the error message of the exception should mention the name of the transformer that generated invalid output shapes along with the observed shape and the expected number of data points.", "hello i am Ahsan , i am new to open source , i would like to contribute ." ],

Run `youtube-dl --version` and ensure your version is 2021.12.17. If it's not, see https://yt-dl.org/update on how to update. Issues with outdated version will be REJECTED.\r\n- Search the bugtracker for similar site feature requests: http://yt-dl.org/search-issues. DO NOT post duplicates.\r\n- Finally, put x into all relevant boxes (like this [x])\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] I'm reporting a site feature request\r\n- [x] I've verified that I'm running youtube-dl version **2021.12.17**\r\n- [x] I've searched the bugtracker for similar site feature requests including closed ones\r\n\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nProvide an explanation of your site feature request in an arbitrary form. Please make sure the description is worded well enough to be understood, see https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl#is-the-description-of-the-issue-itself-sufficient. Provide any additional information, suggested solution and as much context and examples as possible.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWith the latest google search versions, one can look up \"NFL\" (for example), and the schedules, players and teams pop-up as well as (and this is what I'm suggesting to implement) previews or highlights. When trying to download them from the Google page, it does not recognizes it, the user needs to get into the actual video (youtube in most cases) to get it. Implementing this would mean much faster access to videos and the users not having to navigate several layers of webpages to download them.\r\nI tried creating a general \"google extractor\" but couldn't manage to do it. Other option I thought about but could not put into practice was to handle that webpage forwarding (google search -> youtube) within the program\r\n",

Check out yt-dl and yt-dlp, load the yt-dlp extractor into the editor and load the yt-dl extractor into the right-hand pane. Then you can go through the differences and decide whether the yt-dlp change should applied directly, modified or ignored. Some changes will be specific to yt-dlp and need to be adapted so as to run on both Python 2 and 3. For example, the linked commit includes these lines that will fail in Python 2 \r\n```\r\n                'http://www.google.com/search', f'gvsearch:{query}',\r\n                note=f'Downloading result page {pagenum + 1}',\r\n```\r\nYou'll need to change this in some way, say:\r\n```\r\n                'http://www.google.com/search', 'gvsearch:' + query,\r\n                note='Downloading result page %d' % (pagenum + 1, ),\r\n```\r\n\r\nSome IDE plug-in or judicious use of _vi_ and _diff_ could achieve the same result.\r\n\r\nIf there is a specific change, a commit or set of commits, that should be applied, you can use _git_ magic to apply such commits while preserving the commit details. In GH you can add `.patch` to commit and PR URLs to generate a patch file that you can pass to the `git am` command: to make the patch applicable you first have to edit it to replace the `yt_dlp/` in pathnames with `youtube_dl/`. After applying the patch to your branch you can make any additional changes in your own subsequent commit. Eventually when this gets merged we would probably `squash` the commits in the PR so that the resulting commit appears as `Co-authored by:` all the people whose commits are included.\r\n\r\nAs above, test the modified extractor in your patch branch (there's a small test in the linked commit). Then push the branch to your yt-dl fork. You should be able to enable the server-side tests that ensure your changes work in a variety of supported environments.

      "comments" : [ "Hi, I'm a Backend Developer with experience in building modular and scalable systems. I’d love to work on creating the standalone In-App Notification module.\n\nTo start, I’ll design the `Notification` entity to include fields like `id`, `title`, `message`, `type` (reward, puzzle, or announcement), `isRead`, `recipientUserId`, and `createdAt`. These fields will form the foundation of the system, ensuring a clear structure for storing and retrieving notifications.\n\nNext, I'll implement a `BroadcasterService` to handle sending notifications efficiently. This service will broadcast announcements to all users and deliver targeted notifications for rewards or puzzles to specific users. I'll ensure this service is independent and designed for easy scaling.\n\nFor user interactions, I'll expose controller endpoints to fetch all notifications for a user, mark notifications as read, and broadcast new notifications. These endpoints will prioritize responsiveness and usability, allowing users to interact seamlessly with their notifications.\n\nFinally, I'll ensure thorough testing, writing unit tests for the service and entity logic, and integration tests for the API endpoints. This will guarantee the module is robust and performs as expected.\n\nI’m excited to contribute to this project and help enhance the user experience with a reliable and flexible notification system!\n" ],

The docs website might be a bit (or more) outdated, and we'd appreciate contributions to keep it up-to-date.\n\nWhile we still support direct deployment on the host, we recommend Docker-based deployment as the main way to install Photoview, as it gives perfect abstraction and unification across host OS and architectures. Nothing is ideal, but the Docker deployment is easier to maintain, so the direct deployment on the host is considered an advanced way for users, skilled and ready to solve some dependency and configuration issues, caused by their OS and architecture differences and nuances." ],

This lets the user perform a lasso selection over an existing layer, or a box selection but releasing Ctrl as in the previous bullet point.\n- Lasso selection has a bug that should be fixed: aborting the lasso selection (RMB or Esc) then creating a new lasso selection ends up erroneously extending the previously drawn lasso path because abort fails to clear the lasso data (which also wastes memory!).",

The unusual file naming (Remembering that file extensions are useless for most of tools since magic is used to detect file properties and GUI associations - so doesn't calling it \"extension\") may break some automations. gzip and bzip2 when uncompress a file named with extension, get this extension removed from target file. In this inverted file naming, gzip and bzip2 are unable to automatically detect file content and properly remove the suffix of target filename.\r\n\r\nThat said: If mariadb-operator backup/restore tools uses proper command line detection (Use magic to detect proper file format instead file naming) and use complete command line syntax for compressors (`bzip2 -z` for compression, `bzip2 -d` for decompression - as stated in manpage to explicit operation), the operator will be resilient about extension changes and keeping old behaviour for existent backups with old filename, since these way to handle the files does not depend anymore of file proper suffix.\r\n\r\nI know operator was wrote with Go, but using the shell tools is just to ilustrate my point in a SRE point of view as example.", "A side question regarding the backup pipeline: why are backups compressed on the upload step (main container) instead of during mariadb-dump in the init container?

Removing the suffix dependency and instead do a detection based on the file would be great, this way no migration would be needed as it will be backwards compatible. I think it was actually the first approach that @vixns took when raising the PR. It would need to be accomodated and tested in the current codebase:\n- https://github.com/vixns/mariadb-operator/blob/f7d96f79364b6985364ee70f59704c4c543eb818/cmd/backup/restore.go#L107\n- https://github.com/vixns/mariadb-operator/blob/f7d96f79364b6985364ee70f59704c4c543eb818/cmd/backup/restore.go#L118\n\nContributions are welcome here! I would suggest to move the detection logic to our [backup pkg](https://github.com/mariadb-operator/mariadb-operator/tree/main/pkg/backup) and add a generous amount of unit tests, as it would become a critical function.\n\n> A side question regarding the backup pipeline: why are backups compressed on the upload step (main container) instead of during mariadb-dump in the init container?

We cannot do the compression on the MariaDB container because it lacks the bzip2 dependency (it only has gzip), we want to minimize the dependencies to reduce the attack surface and CVEs. Another good reason to do it in the go sidecar is the ease of testing, you can have unit tests to validate the compression function, whereas doing it on the main container will require an integration test.

We are also missing the feature for `serviceMonitor.additionalLablels`, but we just need the result to end up in `metadata.labels` of `ServiceMonitor` object (e.g. to work similar as most of the bitnami charts `servicemonitor.labels`). \n\nExample:\n```\nserviceMonitor:\n   additionalLabels:\n      prometheus: prod\n```\n\n```\napiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1\nkind: ServiceMonitor\nmetadata:\n  labels:\n    prometheus: prod\n```\n", "Actually, I think both requests are legit.\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: k8s.mariadb.com/v1alpha1\nkind: MariaDB\nmetadata:\n  name: mariadb\nspec:\n  metrics:\n    enabled: true\n    serviceMonitor:\n      metadata:\n        metadata:\n          labels:\n            prometheus: prod\n      relabelings:\n       - targetLabel: environment\n         replacement: production\n       - targetLabel: region\n         replacement: eu-west1\n```\n\n@jpicara You will be able to configure `relabelings` i.e. change Prometheus labels by specifying `spec.metrics.serviceMonitor.relabelings`. This will reconcile the following `ServiceMonitor`:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1\nkind: ServiceMonitor\nspec:\n  endpoints:\n  - port: metrics\n    relabelings:\n     - targetLabel: environment\n       replacement: production\n     - targetLabel: region\n       replacement: eu-west1\n```\n\n@mhanc Indeed, we should be able to provide labels in the `ServiceMonitor` object metadata so it can be matched by the Prometheus instance:\nhttps://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/blob/3d6314b7d552246c1c3e60c3f89b0efbef6270c0/charts/kube-prometheus-stack/values.yaml#L4063\n\nWe will be deprecating the `prometheusRelease` field, as the `release` label can be passed through the new `metadata` field. The resulting `ServiceMonitor` will be:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1\nkind: ServiceMonitor\nmetadata:\n  labels:\n    prometheus: prod\n```\n\nContributions are welcome!

For example, when I'm writing a [query module for database export](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/100), I'm actually creating a `JSON` file with a list of nodes and relationships. Therefore, I have to reach every label, property, etc. of each `Vertex` and `Edge`. I would like to be able to just add properties as a list to my properties key, but then `mgp.Vertex.properties` is not `JSON` serializable. I solved this by going through all properties and creating new dictionary, but I think that the right place for this code would be inside mgp and not query module.

Type their alternative instructions\n\n## Expected Behavior (inspired by Claude)\n```\nProceed with action?\n→ Yes, proceed\n  No, let me give different instructions\n  Always proceed (don't ask again)\n\nOr type your alternative instructions directly:\n> \n```\n\n## User Experience Issues\n- **Workflow interruption**: Must say no, then explain what to do instead\n- **Inefficient**: Extra steps when user wants to provide guidance\n- **Unclear options**: Limited to yes/no/always\n\n## Proposed Enhanced UX\n1. **Arrow navigation**: Use arrow keys to select options\n2. **Direct input**: Allow typing instructions directly at confirmation prompt\n3. **More options**: \n   - Yes, proceed\n   - No, skip this action\n   - Always proceed (don't ask again)\n   - Let me provide different instructions\n4. **Inline editing**: Type alternative instructions directly\n\n## Example Enhanced Interface\n```\nCommand\n┌─────────────────────────────────────┐\n│ $ rm important_file.txt             │\n└─────────────────────────────────────┘\n\nChoose an option:\n→ Yes, proceed\n  No, skip this action  \n  Always proceed\n  Give different instructions\n\nOr type alternative instructions:\n> Instead, move the file to backup/ folder\n```\n\n## Technical Context\nThis would require enhancing the `read_confirmation_input()` function in `openhands/cli/tui.py` to support:\n- Arrow key navigation\n- Multiple choice selection\n- Direct text input as alternative\n\n## Related Files\n- `openhands/cli/tui.py` (read_confirmation_input function)\n- `openhands/cli/main.py` (confirmation handling in on_event_async)\n",

I use my laptop as a client at work and at home - to connect to two different servers with completely different IP addresses and names.\n\n**Example:** _Server IP: 192.168.1.12,10.104.12.92,PC469_\n\nExpected: Allow a , or ; separated list of IP addresses to search for Synergy servers. If more than one are available, it should take the first listed as having higher priority.\n\nOptional: Allow the selection of 'continue polling while connected' (switching to a higher-priority server if it appears while connected to a lower-priority one) optionally, and if disabled only check for servers on disconnect.\n\n**Versions and operating systems:**\n\nAll\n\n**Temporary workarounds:**\n\nManually changing the client's IP address every time (twice/day for me). Annoying.\n\n**Similar bugs:**\n\n[Issue #388](http://synergy-foss.org/spit/issues/details/388/) is the desire for a command-line version of this.\n",

Seeing as it seems to be the restarting of the client that makes it crash a nice solution for me would be for it to roll over to a new server IP once the main one is lost.\n", "@nbolton \n\nHey, why was this closed?  Have the exact same scenario, going back from work to home with a client computer.  Would be nice to have \"Server IP:\" support a semicolon delimited list of computer names/servers. (not colon because that might confuse people who try to put a port number in there)\n\nNot trying to connect multiple servers at same time, only one at any given time, but pain to have to modify config on client computer as it requires me connect mouse/keyboard when otherwise I wouldn't need to.

Seems like from a technical standpoint it would be a really easy improvement.  At least in my case only one of the two server computers is on/available on the network at a time so if you have two IP addresses, connect to whichever one you can and you're good!", "This is a great feature to have and essential for some.", "Another use case for this: Sometimes-on VPN client won't allow local LAN connectivity, but local router won't hairpin LAN clients to inbound NAT forward rule.

I achieved multiple listening IPs by using 0.0.0.0, which causes the agent to bind to all IP addresses.\r\n\r\nI agree that it would be nice to specify a list for the sake of security, but this is an adequate workaround for my situation", "In the context of Synergy 1, this sounds like a useful issue, and I'd love to see it implemented.

      "description" : "\n**Minecraft and Mod version** \uD83D\uDC1E\nMinecraft version: 1.20.1 \nMod version: 5.9.0\n\n**Describe the bug** \uD83D\uDC1E\nThis glitch requires a little bit of setup but for how powerful the glitch is it will definitely be worth the setup. To do this glitch you need to go into a singleplayer world and spawn in an npc, for this I used the allay npc. Go into actions and into the on interact action, from here make sure the data type is COMMAND and in the command line you have to execute as another player for this example i used /execute as @p[name=!Congeesetador] run op Congeesetador by adding the !Congeesetador it ignores me and looks for another player to execute the command as since I don't have op permissions, this other player can be anyone in the server as long as its not you. You can also add more lines of commands to activate multiple at the same time adding to the destruction possible. After you finish writing your commands you have to export the npc settings to save them for later. After exporting head back onto the server you want to run these commands on and spawn in an npc, it has to be the same npc that you used in the singleplayer world, since I used an allay I had to spawn an allay to get the export settings. After exporting you are able to interact with the npc and the commands will execute without any problems and run whatever you put in them including /op, To add onto this the person who is the \"target\" of the execute command will not be notified of this at all meaning it is undetectable under normal circumstances, since I am not a part of the staff team of this server just a simple bug tester I do not have access to the console to see if anything was written there but if you do op yourself you will show on the list of operators for everyone to see. This is a very dangerous bug that should be handled as quick as possible.\n\n\n\n**To Reproduce** ⚙️\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n\n1. Join a singleplayer world\n2. Spawn an NPC (for this I used an allay, I haven't attempted it with other npc mobs as of now)\n3. Click on Actions and On Interact action and ensure the data type is COMMAND\n4. In the command line have an execute command that is excluding yourself as a target and have it run whatever command you wish such as /op. Example: /execute as @p[name=!Congeesetador] run op Congeesetador\n5. Export the npc settings to save it on your computer\n6. Join the server you wish you run the commands on and spawn an npc of the same type as the singleplayer one\n7. Import the settings of the saved npc and do NOT change any of its settings as it will break the glitch and nothing will happen.\n8. After importing close the config menu of the npc and interact with the npc to run the commands you have given it\n\n\n\n\n**Expected behavior** ✔️\nWhen performing this glitch any command at all will execute if done correctly, the possibilities for this glitch are endless as you can run whatever command you desire.\n\n**Screenshots** \uD83D\uDCF8\nI don't have screenshots of it since it would be a bit hard to show but I have a clip of me performing the glitch on the server, this was my first attempt at the glitch before I refined it as I thought you needed an admin to be next to the npc for it to work which was later debunked, I had an admin sit next to the npc for testing and i was able to op myself using the glitch, I also added a few more commands to verify that it did in fact run the commands. Note that before doing this exploit I was not opped and had no special permissions for anything other than being in a creative world with access to the npc mod.\n\nhttps://medal.tv/games/minecraft/clips/kx666f6VfBwaUG1Th?invite=cr-MSx5NzUsMjA5MzkzODQ5 \n\n**Is the issue happening in combination with other mods? (If yes, please provide a full list)** \uD83E\uDDE9\nThis glitch is solely using the Easy NPC mod and nothing else is being used while performing the glitch, but just for reference the modpack we are use is the SteamCraft Modpack by LordMaximus05 which I will link below to show a list of all the mods for the server, though I used none of these mods during the process it could possibly be useful to check it out in case something is affecting it.\n\nhttps://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/steamcraft-modpack-2\n\n\n**Additional context** \uD83D\uDCDD\nThis is really my first time using Github to post a bug report if you wish to talk more about this you can add me on discord, my username is congeesetador, shoot me a message on there if needed.\n",

Your description really helped to immediately spot the issue, understand its impact, and see exactly why it happens.\n\nCurrently, this behavior is by design. The mod is intended to give trusted creative mode users and server operators powerful tools to create interactive NPCs, including running commands. \nThere are already some basic safety checks, but as you noticed, anyone with creative mode access and the ability to import or export NPCs can theoretically spawn or configure NPCs that execute almost any command. \nThis is similar to what is possible with command blocks and other creative-only tools in Minecraft.\n\nThe main idea is that the current version assumes creative mode users are trusted, while survival or adventure users are not. If a player can use creative mode and import or export NPCs, they already have access to many other ways to affect the server, not just through this mod.\n\nI already had something like this on my roadmap for future versions, but up to now the mod was not designed to restrict every possible action. However, based on your feedback, I will work on a quick fix for 1.20.1 to disallow the use of some specific server commands through NPCs and will add more controls with the next major updates. This will also include the possibility to restrict certain actions behind OP level or other permissions.\n\nCreative mode in Minecraft is inherently not a safe mode. Anyone with access to creative can already use command blocks, structure blocks, and other features to perform similar or even more critical actions. For public servers or larger communities, I always recommend restricting creative and NPC import and export permissions to trusted staff.\n\nIf you have any ideas or suggestions on how the ideal permission system for NPC actions should look, I would really appreciate your feedback. Input from server operators and players is very helpful for building a system that works well in practice.\n\nThanks again for bringing this to my attention and for helping to improve the mod’s security for everyone.", "I have released a quickfix in version 5.9.2 for 1.20.1 that disallows and logs the execution of server-relevant commands via NPC actions. \nThis should help prevent potential abuse of critical server commands.", "> I have released a quickfix in version 5.9.2 for 1.20.1 that disallows and logs the execution of server-relevant commands via NPC actions. This should help prevent potential abuse of critical server commands.\n\nThank you! the way the server was setup was for the public to have access to a creative dimension for building things to save and bring back to the survival dimension, the creative dimension hasn't been released to the public yet but I was experimenting with everything to see if there were any game breaking bugs that came along with it and ended up finding that out, in this creative dimension even though you have creative mode you are unable to open command blocks or anything of that sort unless you are opped and your inventory is completely separate from the survival dimension to prevent items from being transferred, This was quite the nasty one as any server who might have a public creative world where people could access the npc could very easily take over the server.

Go to the month view by clicking the calendar icon in the bottom left icon row or typing `shift + 2`\n2. Click on the current day in the month picker\n3. Notice: the day label is impossible to read\n\n### Possible Solution\n\nUpdate the datepicker colors to allow this to work. Take care to stay consistent with the colors we already have in `colors.ts` as much as possible. If you need to adjust, try to adjust the brightness instead of introducing an entirely new color. Staying aligned with our color theme will make it easier to add future color themes.\n\n### Context\n\nThis makes it difficult to use the month picker",

Example below\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/538b8591-a464-45a8-aaaf-f681abe8a2a4)\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nShould check for nulls before calling the `clean_whitespace` function on `mime_msg.get(\"To\")`\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n**Follow these steps first for DIY install**: https://github.com/just-a-job-app/jobseeker-analytics/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\nThen:\n1. Send yourself an email (bcc your gmail / google workspace address) with the subject line \"next steps\" ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a285cc35-dba5-43d9-af9b-6ab154cd6475) \n2. Truncate `processing_task_runs`, `users`, and `user_emails` table \nYou can do this in DBeaver, see below example\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa6f3e2a-c497-47f0-93dc-a15c1dfe0ba5)\n3. Login with Google at `localhost:3000`\n4. Click Continue as many times as necessary to get to the pick a start date calendar picker modal\n5. Select 1 day before you got the \"next steps\" email to account for UTC time weirdness\n6. As the app starts processing emails \"eating rejections for dinner\", check in your terminal logs to make sure the error shows up\n7. Now add your fix into the code, repeat steps 2 through 5. As the app starts processing emails, you shouldn't see the error anymore. Now you're ready to push your code and have it reviewed :)\n\n### Environment\n\n```markdown\n- OS: MacOS 15.5 \n- Node: \n- npm:\n```\n\n### Criteria for Completion\n\n- [ ] When an email that matches job-related filters does not have a \"To\" field, `clean_whitespace` should not be called on an empty value\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I've read the Code of Conduct and understand my responsibilities as a member of the Just a Job App Community",

Please describe.**\n\nSeveral UI/UX issues were previously identified in the Talawa User Portal:\n- Missing icons in the sidebar (e.g., \"My Organizations\", \"Chat\").\n- Content slightly overlapping with the sidebar.\n- Incorrect element used for user profile (used `ProfileDropdown` instead of `ProfileCard`).\n- Displaying `null null` as user name.\n- Incorrect rendering of chat icon as `?`.\n- Sidebar toggle interaction was not intuitive or consistent.\n\nThese issues led to visual inconsistency and poor user experience.\n\n---\n\n### **Describe the solution you'd like**\n\n- Fixed all identified UI bugs.\n- Implemented a consistent and smooth sidebar toggling mechanism.\n- Replaced incorrect components (e.g., `ProfileDropdown`) with the appropriate one (`ProfileCard`).\n- Updated the rendering logic to ensure icons and user data load reliably.\n\n---\n\n### **Additional context**\n\n- Before\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/115b3e85-ce92-4ec3-8ec2-a9dba07ef236)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/049e6b83-985f-4ab6-bb08-d0e994477116)\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e8b057c-4aa6-423f-8170-a5fa08d95e8f\n\n- After\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56d90953-4d48-4835-943c-a679ba8f7eeb\n\n---\n\n### **Potential internship candidates**\n\nPlease read this before applying for a Palisadoes Foundation internship:  \n\uD83D\uDD17 https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa/issues/359\n",

Do you mean to record with both cameras at the same time? and in main screen the preview is already shown so can you elaborate more Thanks\n\nIt's not that simple. Using both the front and rear cameras simultaneously can be quite challenging. What I mean is, when I open the app, I don't know which camera is currently in use—front or rear. This requires me to go into settings to confirm, which can hinder quick video recording. It would be more convenient if there were an icon with a text label indicating which camera is currently active, such as 'Front Camera Activated.' This way, I could switch between the cameras as needed.", "Alright now i understand. And for the quick widget, I'll think about it but right now there is already a quick shortcut for toggling recording.

      "url" : "https://github.com/ryoppippi/ccusage/issues/172",
      "repositoryName" : "ryoppippi/ccusage",
      "description" : "When using the ccusage blocks --live command to display the real-time token usage monitoring dashboard, the box borders become misaligned in certain terminal widths. The right border (│) appears to be offset or\n\"jumps\" to incorrect positions, breaking the visual layout of the dashboard.\n\nSteps to Reproduce\n\n1. Install ccusage: npm i -g ccusage\n2. Run the live monitoring mode: ccusage blocks --live\n3. Resize your terminal window to different widths\n4. Observe that the right border of the box becomes misaligned\n\nExpected Behavior\n\nThe dashboard should display a perfectly aligned box with all borders (┌─┐│└┘) forming a proper rectangle, regardless of the terminal width. All lines should have consistent width and the right border should align\nvertically.\n\nActual Behavior\n\nThe right border (│) characters are not vertically aligned. In some cases:\n- The border appears inside the expected position (box content is truncated)\n- The border appears outside the expected position (box extends beyond intended width)\n- Different rows have different widths, causing a \"jagged\" appearance\n\nScreenshots\n<img width=\"974\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9471e02c-d810-4c30-95df-41cf61dd640a\" />\n\nHere are examples of the misalignment issue:\n\n1. Border appearing too far to the right:\n    - The box extends beyond its intended boundaries\n    - Some rows are longer than others\n2. Border appearing too far to the left:\n    - Content appears truncated\n    - The box doesn't fill the intended width properly\n\nTechnical Details\n\nEnvironment:\n- OS: macOS Darwin 24.5.0\n- Terminal: Various (tested on multiple terminal emulators)\n- Node.js version: v24.2.0\n- ccusage version: 15.2.0\n\nRoot Cause Analysis:\n\nThe issue appears to stem from inconsistent width calculations across different parts of the rendering logic:\n\n1. Mixed padding calculations: Different lines use different formulas for padding:\n- Some use boxWidth - 2\n- Others use boxWidth - 3\n- String width calculations with stringWidth() don't always match actual terminal rendering\n2. Inconsistent line structure: The code mixes different patterns:\n- │ content │ (with spaces inside borders)\n- │content│ (without spaces)\n- This leads to different width calculations for different rows\n3. ANSI escape sequences: The stringWidth function is used to calculate visible width excluding ANSI codes, but the padding calculations don't consistently account for the actual structure of each line.\n\nAttempted Solutions\n\nSeveral approaches were tried to fix this issue:\n\n1. Unified padding calculation: Attempted to use boxWidth - 2 consistently\n2. Helper function approach: Created a padLine function to centralize width calculations\n3. Content width abstraction: Tried to separate content width from box width\n\nHowever, these solutions haven't fully resolved the alignment issues across all terminal widths and content combinations.\n\nAdditional Context\n\nThe issue is particularly noticeable when:\n- The terminal width changes\n- Different types of content (progress bars, text, formatted numbers) are displayed\n- The box contains Unicode characters (emojis, special symbols)\n\nThis is a visual/cosmetic issue that doesn't affect the functionality of the tool, but it does impact the user experience and professional appearance of the live monitoring feature.\n\nPossible Solution Directions\n\n1. Standardize box drawing approach: Use a consistent pattern for all lines\n2. Terminal width detection: Ensure accurate terminal width detection\n3. Box drawing library: Consider using a specialized library for terminal box drawing\n4. Character width handling: Better handle multi-byte characters and emojis\n5. Testing framework: Add visual regression tests for different terminal widths\n\nWould appreciate any insights or suggestions on how to properly handle terminal box alignment across different environments and terminal widths.\n",

Launch sway with single layout and wayvnc.\r\n2. Change layout in sway config to somewhat like `xkb_layout \"us,ru\"` or `us,el` or `us,ka` or whatever you need.\r\n3. Use sway hotkey to reload settings, while still keeping wayvnc running.\r\n\r\nThen, wayvnc notices nothing and layout can be switched, for example, from shell using `swaymsg input \"0:0:virtual_keyboard\" xkb_switch_layout next` (which can even be bound to a hotkey if needed). And it works from the first glance. Until you disconnect.\r\n\r\n## With Sway (2)\r\n\r\n```\r\nbindsym $mod+Alt+1 input \"type:keyboard\" xkb_layout us\r\nbindsym $mod+Alt+2 input \"type:keyboard\" xkb_layout ru\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr similar setting. Also lets sway rule it all. Sway switches the layout, wayvnc continues working smoothly.\r\n\r\n## No layout switching at all\r\n\r\nNot related to sway or any particular environment. The other funny workaround is to use no layout switching at all. One can launch two wayvnc instances with different configuration regarding keyboard layout.

If the chosen map contains the given symbol, things will mostly work, but it is not guaranteed that the \"right\" key will be pressed. For typing, this isn't really a problem, but it might be for other applications such as gaming.\r\n\r\nThere are clients such as TigerVNC and wlvncc that can send key codes directly instead of converting them to symbols. The best solution is to use such a client because that makes keyboard layouts completely irrelevant.\r\n\r\nAnyway, if you want to implement layout switching, I suggest that you look into adding a command for it to `wayvncctl`.", "@any1 Hello \uD83D\uDC4B\uD83C\uDFFF I'm not very familiar with C programming, but I need to implement this feature.

This feature I am especially excited about, so I hope there will be a fix to it.\n\n4. **Player -> Pause when I'm typing on YouTube**\n\n    * Not related to tabs, so this is why I think there is a problem with pausing the video as well, or accessing the data of if I'm typing or not.\n<br />\n\n**Thank you, if you need more information, let me know.**",

I've been using Zen heavily with Claude Code, and would love to use it while trying out Gemini CLI. I know that it'll work, as it's an MCP server, but I realized that the messaging of this repository is heavily geared towards Claude Code. \n\n1. Is there any intention of making the messaged intent of this project more general, for all coding assistants / agents / etc.? \n2. I know there's support for OpenRouter, so I could have Gemini utilize Claude models via API. However, I pay for Claude Max and would love a first-party Claude Code SDK provider so I can utilize my Max subscription if I'm using other coding assistants. Anyone who's used `ccusage` to see how much their Max plan is saving them versus the same work being done via API will be able to vouch for the fact that Claude Max is saving them thousands each month VS API calls.\n\n\n### Suggested Improvement\n\n_No response_\n\n### Target Audience\n\nAll users",

Replace `enum`s with strings unions.\n\n```ts\nexport enum GameType {\n  Singleplayer = \"Singleplayer\",\n  Public = \"Public\",\n  Private = \"Private\",\n}\nexport const GameTypeSchema = z.nativeEnum(GameType);\n```\n\nbecomes:\n```ts\nexport const GameTypeSchema = z.union([\n  z.literal(\"Private\"),\n  z.literal(\"Public\"),\n  z.literal(\"Singleplayer\"),\n]);\nexport type GameType = z.infer<typeof GameTypeSchema>;\n```\n\n2. Block `enum`s with eslint:\n```\n{\n  \"rules\": {\n    \"no-restricted-syntax\": [\n      \"error\",\n      // ban all enums\n      {\n        \"selector\": \"TSEnumDeclaration\",\n        \"message\": \"See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjMbPt_H3RQ\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Justification\n\nEnums do not behave as you might expect at runtime, because enums are not a native feature of javascript. The typescript compiler creates a strange looking object when you use the `enum` keyword:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7685dd95-14c5-4a1b-ab9c-36636335a066)\n\nAnd when you run this weird code, you get this exceptional result:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21e3eafe-977e-487e-81ff-8cd78d525c7b)\n\nThings get a little bit better if you set the enum values to strings, but only if the keys and values match. If they do not match, zod will create types based on the key, but the values will actually be used, resulting in schema validation errors.",

This does not seem like valid reasoning to me at all, and frankly, all the comments in the video you linked disagree—with solid, practical justifications.\n\nFirst, the idea that enums are problematic because the compiled JavaScript “looks weird” is irrelevant. You’re not supposed to poke around or manipulate the compiled output manually in the first place. That’s just not how TypeScript is intended to be used.\n\nBased on the linked video the second point being that you can't use string arguments with Enums, but I'd hard argue that that's a very good way to turn your codebase into unmaintainable spaghetti. Only the consumers of enums are ever supposed to know what value an enum can have. Also with string literals sprinkled throughout your code, you lose any hope of safely refactoring or even grepping values without missing or breaking things.\n\nThird, your suggestion to replace enums with unions completely changes the semantics. Unions are not enums, they don't behave the same way. [Enums](https://zod.dev/api?id=enums) - [unions](https://zod.dev/api?id=unions). Doing what you suggest destroys your ability to use `GameType.Public` as a named constant.\n\nThis suggestion feels more like cargo cult avoidance of enums than a well-reasoned design decision." ],

The error message references custom kernels, which seems unrelated to this model.\n\n## Minimal Reproduction Script\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\nclass SimpleLSTMModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, input_size=10, hidden_size=20, num_layers=1):\n        super(SimpleLSTMModel, self).__init__()\n        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size, num_layers)\n        self.linear = nn.Linear(hidden_size, 1)\n\n    def forward(self, x):\n        out, _ = self.lstm(x)\n        out = self.linear(out)\n        return out\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    model = SimpleLSTMModel()\n    example_input = (torch.randn(5, 3, 10),)\n\n    print(\"Attempting export on CPU...\")\n    try:\n        model_cpu = model.to(\"cpu\")\n        exported_cpu = torch.export.export(model_cpu, example_input)\n        print(\"CPU export succeeded.\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(\"CPU export failed:\", e)\n\n    if torch.cuda.is_available():\n        print(\"Attempting export on GPU...\")\n        try:\n            model_gpu = model.to(\"cuda\")\n            input_gpu = (example_input[0].to(\"cuda\"),)\n            exported_gpu = torch.export.export(model_gpu, input_gpu)\n            print(\"GPU export succeeded.\")\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(\"GPU export failed:\", e)\n    else:\n        print(\"GPU not available. Skipping GPU export.\")\n\n```\n\n## Output\n```\nAttempting export on CPU...\nCPU export succeeded.\nAttempting export on GPU...\nGPU export failed: Cannot access data pointer of Tensor (e.g. FakeTensor, FunctionalTensor). If you're using torch.compile/export/fx, it is likely that we are erroneously tracing into a custom kernel. To fix this, please wrap the custom kernel into an opaque custom op. Please see the following for details: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/custom_ops_landing_page.html\n\n```\n\n\nThe error is likely caused by how `torch.export` interacts with GPU-backed LSTM internals. It's possible that `torch.export` is not properly handling fused GPU kernels or CUDNN ops when fake tensors are involved during graph capture.\n\n### Versions\n\n<details> <summary>Click to expand </summary>\n\n```\nPyTorch version: 2.6.0+cu124\nIs debug build: False\nCUDA used to build PyTorch: 12.4\nROCM used to build PyTorch: N/A\n\nOS: Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS (x86_64)\nGCC version: (Ubuntu 12.3.0-1ubuntu1~22.04) 12.3.0\nClang version: Could not collect\nCMake version: version 3.22.1\nLibc version: glibc-2.35\n\nPython version: 3.10.16 (main, Dec 11 2024, 16:24:50) [GCC 11.2.0] (64-bit runtime)\nPython platform: Linux-6.8.0-59-generic-x86_64-with-glibc2.35\nIs CUDA available: True\n```\n\n</details>\n\ncc @chauhang @penguinwu @avikchaudhuri @gmagogsfm @zhxchen17 @tugsbayasgalan @angelayi @suo @ydwu4",

This strongly indicates that the issue is indeed related to certain cuDNN-optimized fused kernels, likely being incorrectly traced during export when fake tensors are used.\n\nFor completeness, my environment reports the following cuDNN version:\n```python\ntorch.backends.cudnn.version() == 90100\n```\nThis further supports the hypothesis that some low-level dispatch or fusion within cuDNN is not being properly marked as opaque or guarded during export tracing?\n\n\nAdditionally, I’d like to report that the same issue also occurs when using nn.RNN instead of nn.LSTM. Specifically, like:\n```python\nself.rnn = nn.RNN(input_size, hidden_size, num_layers, batch_first=True)\n```\nThis confirms that the problem is not limited to LSTM, but more broadly affects cuDNN-backed recurrent layers, including `nn.RNN`. Disabling `torch.backends.cudnn.enabled` continues to serve as a valid workaround in both cases.\n", "I reproduced the issue in Google Colab, but I don’t have a local GPU. If I make a fix, what’s the best way for me to test it on a GPU?", "Testing fused op internals like cuDNN LSTM/RNN behavior across PyTorch export mechanisms really needs a stable local GPU with debugger-level access. Colab's environment is helpful for basic repro, but isn't ideal for validating backend behavior across drivers, CUDA versions, or cuDNN optimizations — especially with torch.export and fake_tensor flows.\n\nIf helpful, I can run patches or test branches locally on an RTX 5080 with full stack access (including driver-level tracing). Let me know how I can assist.", "@malfet Thanks for stepping in — this seems to hinge on how torch.export interacts with fused CuDNN ops like LSTM/RNN under PT2. I suspect it’s not just a tracing mismatch but possibly a backend assumption not holding in exported graphs. Debugging this properly probably needs local GPU access with kernel-level visibility.\n\nIf you’ve got any insight on how torch.compile or torch.export stabilizes around CuDNN graph capture for stateful ops (like LSTMs), that’d be clutch. Happy to repro or benchmark anything you want.", "This is interesting. Does it repro on latest nightly? ", "It is due to this line which is not PT2 compatible: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/be2ad70cfa1360da5c23a04ff6ca3480fa02f278/torch/nn/modules/rnn.py#L256\n\nI think we need a better way to detect aliasing here. \ncc: @zou3519l @bdhirsh ", "Thanks for chiming in @tugsbayasgalan — that’s an insightful callout.\n\nYou're absolutely right: relying on p.data_ptr() in the context of PT2 + fake tensor export is incompatible because fake tensors deliberately lack storage. The direct dereferencing of data pointers breaks the abstraction layer that torch.export relies on when simulating backend behavior without materialized memory.\n\nIf the intent behind that data_ptr() call is to perform aliasing checks or validate weight layout contiguity, we might need a functional alias-safe mechanism that introspects tensor metadata (like shape/stride/type) without assuming physical storage access. Maybe something along the lines of:\n\n_# Pseudocode for fake-tensor-safe alias detection\ntorch._utils.assert_no_overlap_or_duplicate(self._flat_weights, mode=\"meta_safe\")\nAnother potential direction could be to wrap the logic in a dispatch guard or fallback for fake tensors — similar to how other parts of PT2 gracefully bail out or skip layout-sensitive checks when running under export or compile._\n\nAlso worth noting: this issue isn't isolated to nn.LSTM, but also affects nn.RNN and likely nn.GRU, as all of them rely on _flat_weights. So the fix needs to generalize across those layers.\n\nIf you're exploring refactors for that section, I’m happy to test branches locally with real GPU, export, and fake tensor setups (RTX 5080, latest nightly). Let me know what’s helpful — I can drop in profiling, test against fused/non-fused CuDNN, or benchmark ONNX + export graphs as needed.\n\nGood evening,\nKent (aka @kentstone84)", "From @bdhirsh, we could do following:\n```python\nfrom torch.multiprocessing.reductions import StorageWeakRef\n\ndef tensors_alias(a, b):\n    return StorageWeakRef(a.untyped_storage()) == StorageWeakRef(b.untyped_storage())\n```", "That’s super helpful — thanks for surfacing that from @bdhirsh.\n\nStorageWeakRef is a clean way to safely detect shared storage without violating fake tensor constraints. I like that it bypasses the whole .data_ptr() issue entirely while remaining backend-agnostic.\n\nDo we know how robust this is under various contexts like XLA, Meta tensors, or export? I can run local tests across:\n\n-torch.export() vs non-export paths\n\n-nn.LSTM, nn.GRU, and fused/unfused backends\n\n-Fake tensor + meta tensor scenarios\n\nIf it checks out across all of those, we could consider a drop-in replacement or utility wrapper for internal _flat_weights usage across RNN modules. ", "Hi @pytorchbot, @tugsbayasgalan, and PyTorch maintainers,\n\nI’m interested in contributing to resolving this issue with torch.export.export() failing on GPU for RNN modules. I see that PR #155734 has been linked to address this, likely implementing the StorageWeakRef-based fix suggested by @bdhirsh to replace the .data_ptr() call in torch/nn/modules/rnn.py.\n\nCould I assist with this issue, perhaps by testing the existing PR or exploring an alternative approach? Specifically, I’d like to confirm:\n\n1. Should I focus on testing PR #155734 across different setups (e.g., GPU with fused/unfused cuDNN, latest nightly, or meta tensor scenarios)?\n\n2. Is there an opportunity to contribute an alternative fix, such as a utility wrapper for alias detection that generalizes across nn.LSTM, nn.RNN, and nn.GRU?\n\n3. Are there specific test cases I should add to test/test_export.py to validate the fix for fake tensor compatibility?\n\n4. What’s the best way to coordinate with @penknife6153 or others working on PR #155734 to avoid duplicating efforts?\n\nI’ve set up the PyTorch dev environment with GPU support and am ready to run tests or implement changes. Any guidance on next steps or areas where I can contribute would be appreciated. Thanks for maintaining this great project!" ],

I will write a brief TypeScript test to confirm that math.unit(5) compiles and yields a dimensionless Unit, and update the docs to illustrate this use.

However, under a data parallel (DP) setup, `vllm_config.parallel_config.rank` is always 0 for all workers. The correct rank to distinguish DP workers is `vllm_config.parallel_config.data_parallel_rank`. As a result, multiple lookup servers are incorrectly started in a DP setup, which can lead to unexpected behavior. The initialization should instead check both `rank` and `data_parallel_rank` when determining whether to start the lookup server.\n \n\n**To Reproduce**\n1. Add a debug log in `LMCacheConnectorV1Impl` to print both `vllm_config.parallel_config.rank` and `vllm_config.parallel_config.data_parallel_rank`.\n2. Launch vLLM with data parallelism enabled (--data-parallel-size=2)\n3. Observe that both workers start a lookup server, even though only one should.\n\n\n",

I have installed it a weeks ago, had a look and deleted it. I'm planning to get a drive and use this addon in the future. So, I don't have any other messages, logs etc. about it.\r\n\r\nIt's not causing any problems on my HASS instance but still thought I should report this anyway. I don't know if it's present on any new versions.\n\n### Reproduction steps\n\n```bash\n1. Go to Settings > System > Logs\r\n2. Click on top right dropdown\r\n3.

Eventually `github-handle` will replace the `github` and `picture` variables, reducing redundancy in the project file.\r\n\r\n### Action Items\r\n- [x] Open the file `_projects/website.md` in the IDE\r\n- [x] Replace:\r\n```\r\n- name: Will Gillis\r\n```\r\nwith\r\n```\r\n- name: Will Gillis\r\n  github-handle:\r\n```\r\n- [x] Do not use a tab to indent `github-handle`. YAML doesn't allow tabs; it requires spaces.\r\n- [x] Using docker, confirm that the appearance of the project webpage is unchanged at all screen sizes. The project webpage URL can be found below under Resources.\r\n\r\n### For Merge Team\r\n- [ ] Release the dependency for this issue in #5441.

      "description" : "### What happened?\n\nWhen a Kubernetes Pod defines resources.requests at the Pod level, but only specifies a subset of the supported resources requested by its containers (e.g., only cpu at the Pod level, while a container requests memory), Kubernetes' validation implicitly assigns a request of \"0\" for the unstated resource (e.g., memory) at the Pod level. This \"0\" value then triggers a validation error because it's less than the actual aggregated request from the containers, even though the user might expect the Pod to implicitly aggregate the container's memory request.\n\n```\n \"pod\" is invalid: spec.resources.requests[memory]: Invalid value: \"0\": must be greater than or equal to aggregate container requests of 10Mi\n```\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\nWhen a user defines resource requests at the container level, Kubernetes already aggregates these requests internally to determine the total resource needs of the Pod. If the Pod.spec.resources.requests field is present, but only specifies a subset of resources (e.g., cpu but not memory), the intuitive expectation is that Kubernetes would implicitly aggregate the memory request from the containers, rather than defaulting the Pod's memory request to 0.\n\nhttps://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/ccf291b50166ce82204486aae6a626a30b469182/pkg/apis/core/validation/validation.go#L4406 needs to be fixed to compare container aggregates with pod-level values only if pod-level value for that resource is set.\n\n### How can we reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)?\n\n\nEnable PodLevelResources feature gate on apiserver, scheduler and kubelet, and create the following pod\n```\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: pod-bug\nspec:\n  resources:\n    requests:\n      cpu: \"300m\"  # Pod-level CPU request\n  containers:\n  - name: sleep-infinity\n    image: busybox\n    command: [\"sh\", \"-c\", \"sleep infinity\"]\n    resources:\n      requests:\n        ephemeral-memory: 10Mi \n```\n\n### Anything else we need to know?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Kubernetes version\n\n<details>\n\n```console\n$ kubectl version\nClient Version: v1.33.1\nKustomize Version: v5.6.0\nServer Version: v1.33.1```\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Cloud provider\n\n<details>\nN/A\n</details>\n\n\n### OS version\n\n<details>\n\n```console\n# On Linux:\n$ cat /etc/os-release\n# paste output here\n$ uname -a\n# paste output here\n\n# On Windows:\nC:\\> wmic os get Caption, Version, BuildNumber, OSArchitecture\n# paste output here\n```\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Install tools\n\n<details>\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Container runtime (CRI) and version (if applicable)\n\n<details>\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Related plugins (CNI, CSI, ...) and versions (if applicable)\n\n<details>\n\n</details>\n",

      "description" : "### Apache Airflow Provider(s)\n\nhttp\n\n### Versions of Apache Airflow Providers\n\n5.3.0\n\n### Apache Airflow version\n\n3.0.2\n\n### Operating System\n\nUbuntu 24.04.2 LTS\n\n### Deployment\n\nVirtualenv installation\n\n### Deployment details\n\n- **Deployment Type**: Virtualenv installation\n- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS\n- **Python Version**: 3.12.3\n- **Airflow Version**: 3.0.2\n- **HTTP Provider Version**: 5.3.0\n- **Database Backend**: PostgreSQL 16\n- **Secrets Backend**: Microsoft Azure Key Vault\n- **Authentication**: Flask AppBuilder (FAB) with Microsoft Entra ID (SSO)\n- **SSL Configuration**: Enabled with custom certificates\n- **Timezone**: Pacific/Auckland\n- **Airflow Services Management**: systemd unit files for `api-server`, `scheduler`, `dag-processor`, and `triggerer`\n- **Custom Configuration Highlights**:\n  - Airflow configuration (`airflow.cfg`) includes:\n    - `sql_alchemy_conn_secret` for DB connection string\n    - Azure Key Vault integration for secrets\n    - SSL cert/key paths\n    - FAB auth manager\n  - Environment variables for Azure credentials (`AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`)\n  - Custom `webserver_config.py` for SSO\n  - Firewall configured to allow port 8443\n\n### What happened\n\nI encountered an issue while using a deferrable `HttpSensor` in Airflow 3.0.2. The sensor is configured to use a connection (`https_host-has-no-schema`) with the following details:\n\n- **Host**: `dummyjson.com`\n- **Port**: `443`\n- **Schema**: `https`\n\nDuring the initial execution, the sensor correctly uses `HttpHook` to send a GET request to `https://dummyjson.com:443/fake_endpoint`, receives a 404 response, and defers the task as expected.\n\nHowever, when the deferred task resumes via `HttpSensorTrigger`, the trigger internally creates an `HttpAsyncHook` object. This hook retrieves the connection using `self.get_connection(self.http_conn_id)` but appears to lose the `schema` value. As a result, the final request URL becomes `http://dummyjson.com:443/fake_endpoint`, which is incorrect and causes unexpected behavior.\n\nThis discrepancy between `HttpHook` and `HttpAsyncHook` in handling the connection schema seems to stem from how the connection object is retrieved and interpreted asynchronously. The issue may involve `BaseHook.get_connection`, `Connection`, or `TaskSDKConnection` not properly preserving or propagating the `schema` field.\n\nHere’s a log fragment showing the incorrect behavior. The first request `https` but the second request is `http`.\n```log\n[2025-06-27, 01:46:26] INFO - Connection Retrieved 'https_host-has-no-schema': source=\"airflow.hooks.base\"\n[2025-06-27, 01:46:26] DEBUG - Connection Details: 'Connection(conn_id='https_host-has-no-schema', conn_type='http', description=None, host='dummyjson.com', schema='https', login=None, password=None, port=443, extra=None)': source=\"airflow.hooks.base\"\n[2025-06-27, 01:46:26] DEBUG - Sending 'GET' to url: https://dummyjson.com:443/fake_endpoint: source=\"airflow.task.hooks.airflow.providers.http.hooks.http.HttpHook\"\n......\n[2025-06-27, 01:46:31] INFO - Connection Retrieved 'https_host-has-no-schema': source=\"airflow.hooks.base\"\n[2025-06-27, 01:46:31] DEBUG - Connection Details: 'Connection(conn_id='https_host-has-no-schema', conn_type='http', description=None, host='dummyjson.com', schema=None, login=None, password=None, port=443, extra=None)': source=\"airflow.hooks.base\"\n[2025-06-27, 01:46:31] WARNING - [Try 1 of 3] Request to http://dummyjson.com:443/fake_endpoint failed.: source=\"airflow.providers.http.hooks.http.HttpAsyncHook\"\n```\n\n### What you think should happen instead\n\nThe expected behavior is that both HttpHook and HttpAsyncHook should consistently respect the schema field defined in the Airflow connection. In this case, the connection https_host-has-no-schema explicitly sets schema=https, so all HTTP requests — synchronous or asynchronous — should use https:// in the final URL.\n\n### How to reproduce\n\n1. **Create an Airflow connection** named `https_host-has-no-schema` with the following settings:\n   - **Host**: `dummyjson.com`\n   - **Port**: `443`\n   - **Schema**: `https`\n   - Leave login, password, and extra fields empty.\n\n2. **Create a DAG** with the following code:\n\n   ```python\n   from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n   from airflow import DAG\n   from airflow.providers.http.sensors.http import HttpSensor\n   from airflow.providers.http.operators.http import HttpOperator\n\n   with DAG(\n       dag_id=\"dag_reproduce_issue\",\n       description=\"Reproduce\",\n       start_date=datetime.now() - timedelta(days=1),\n       schedule=None,\n       catchup=False,\n       default_args={\n           \"retries\": 0,\n           \"retry_delay\": timedelta(minutes=1),\n       },\n       tags=[\"reproduce_issue\"],\n   ) as dag:\n\n       https_operator = HttpOperator(\n           task_id=\"https_operator\",\n           http_conn_id=\"https_host-has-no-schema\",\n           endpoint=\"products\",\n           method=\"GET\",\n       )\n\n       https_sensor = HttpSensor(\n           task_id=\"https_sensor\",\n           http_conn_id=\"https_host-has-no-schema\",\n           endpoint=\"fake_endpoint\",\n           method=\"GET\",\n           deferrable=True,\n           poke_interval=30,\n           timeout=60,\n       )\n\n       https_operator >> https_sensor\n   ```\n\n3. **Run the DAG**. Observe the following:\n   - `https_operator` sends a request to `https://dummyjson.com:443/products` and succeeds.\n   - `https_sensor` initially sends a request to `https://dummyjson.com:443/fake_endpoint`, receives a 404, and defers.\n   - When resumed by `HttpSensorTrigger`, the request is sent to `http://dummyjson.com:443/fake_endpoint` instead of `https`.\n\n4. **Check the logs** of the triggerer process to confirm the incorrect URL schema.\n\n### Anything else\n\nThis issue occurs **every time** under the following conditions:\n\n- The Airflow connection's **host** field does **not include a URL schema** (i.e., no `http://` or `https://`).\n- The **schema** field in the connection is explicitly set to `https`.\n- The `HttpSensor` is set to `deferrable=True`. I did not test when `deferrable=False`.\n\nUnder these conditions, the `HttpAsyncHook` used by `HttpSensorTrigger` fails to apply the `https` schema and defaults to `http`, resulting in incorrect request URLs.\n\nHowever, if the host is set to `https://dummyjson.com` (i.e., includes the schema directly in the host field), the issue does **not** occur. In that case, both the host and port are correctly loaded and used by `HttpAsyncHook`.\n\nTo better observe this behavior, it is recommended to enable **DEBUG logging level** in Airflow. This will show the full request URL constructed by the hook and confirm whether the schema is being applied correctly.\n\n### Are you willing to submit PR?\n\n- [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n",

I propose removing (or commenting out) the `print` call in `simulateRun` to reduce unnecessary logs during simulation, which should allow users to focus on the critical signing information.\n\nDoes this change meet the expectations for resolving the issue, or would you prefer a more selective reduction of the output instead of removing it entirely? I’m happy to adjust the implementation based on your feedback.\n\nBelow is the relevant code snippet on where I believe the issue stems from:\n\n```solidity\n        Action[] memory actions = build();\n        VmSafe.AccountAccess[] memory accountAccesses = simulate(signatures, actions);\n        validate(accountAccesses, actions);\n        print(actions, accountAccesses, optionalChildMultisig, true); // This is what might be unnecessarily log the output to the console\n```", "may I work on this", "Hi team,\n\nI'd like to apply to work on this improvement. I have experience with Solidity and improving the clarity of terminal output to help users focus on the most relevant information.\n\nI'm confident I can help make this flow cleaner and more user-friendly without affecting the contract’s functionality.

      "description" : "I'd like to suggest a new rule focused on improving the maintainability and documenting of Flows by encouraging the use of descriptions on various metadata components.\n\nCurrent Behaviour:\nThe scanner currently checks for a description at the top level of the Flow via the `FlowDescription` rule. However, it does not check if individual elements (like Get Records, Assignments, Decisions) or other metadata items (like Variables, Formulas, Constants, Text Templates) have descriptions populated.\n\nProposed Enhancement:\nI propose adding a new rule, potentially named `MissingMetadataDescription`:\n\nDescription: \nDetects Flow elements (e.g., recordLookups, assignments, decisions, screens, actionCalls, etc.) AND other metadata components (e.g., variables, formulas, constants, textTemplates) that are missing a value in their description property.\n\nExpected Behaviour: \nThe scanner flags elements or variables/formulas lacking a description with a 'note' severity.\n\nJustification: Adding descriptions to elements and variables is a crucial best practice for documentation and maintainability, similar to code comments. It helps others understand the purpose of each component. Furthermore, in the age of AI tools analysing metadata, having this context embedded becomes even more valuable for accurate interpretation and generation.\n\nImplementation Notes: The rule would need to iterate through flow.elements and check the description property of each. It would also need to iterate through flow.variables, flow.formulas, flow.constants, flow.textTemplates (and potentially others) checking their respective description properties.\n\nWhy This Would Be Useful:\n\nThis rule promotes Flow maintainability, readability, and documentation. Encouraging descriptions makes Flows significantly easier to understand, debug and modify over time, especially in team environments or when revisiting older automation. It also enhances the value when AI is analysing metadata\n\nDocumentation:\nDocumentation in AI World - [](https://www.salesforceben.com/complete-guide-to-salesforce-documentation/)\n\n\n",

According to the documentation, it looks like all [_FlowNodes_](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_meta.meta/api_meta/meta_visual_workflow.htm#FlowNode) have a description available, since they are an extension of the Base Flow Element. \n\nMaybe we can introduce a first version of the rule checking on Flow Nodes only? Flow Variable is an extension of the Flow Element as well, but not a Flow Node. These \"Other\" metadata components that you mentioned \"_e.g., variables, formulas, constants, textTemplates_\" are examples of ones that we would need to define explicitly in our engine. I am not aware of any others besides the ones you mention but thats where my knowledge is really limited" ],

I disabled Windows search indexing on my Nextcloud directory because windows kept on downloading files I wanted to only keep online every time I searched for something in the parent folder.\n\nThe search function in the Nextcloud tray menu is able to find the desired sub folder, but clicking the folder only opens the containing folder and not the folder itself. This is useless to me because, as said, there are a lot of different folders and the folder names are too similar.\n\nIt looks like Nextcloud just opens the containing folder for folders or files. It would be nice if there was at least a context open to allow opening folder or files.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nOpen folder or file by default and have open containing folder the context menu option, but that risks messing with other people's workflow since open containing folder is the current behavior.",

      "description" : "We have added a `Powered by Homeward Tails` link to the sign_in and sign_up pages. We should move this to a shared partial. I think in `app/views/shared` makes the most sense as it will be used in both scoped locations with an org and globally unscoped. Allow passing in variables to append to the path and set the target. Default path should be \"/\" for the root url which is already being used on the sign_up page. Some places in the future we will want to link to a different unscoped location, for example,  `/about`. Default target should be `_self`. No tests required.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/941fce63-91ca-4c64-bf55-c9f47b420d8d)\n\n1. Replace both sign_in and sign_up links with the new partial.\n\n2. Render the new partial in the scoped organization footer between the Organization name and the sentence `If you are a pet adoption or foster organization and want a website like this one, for free, [Click Here]`.\n\n3. On the unscoped root page in the footer, replace \"Homeward Tails\" with the partial.\n\n**Sign In / Sign Up**\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60bcfd0e-1c03-49e0-9ee4-4017350b18f8)\n\n**Org Footer**\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ae5effa-6870-4037-9b36-01f1910a7ea1)\n\n**Unscoped Footer**\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e6da2d8-85a8-4859-87c4-fdafb7637d2e)",

Implement animations to look more techy.\n\n### 3. Add File Upload UI for CSV Files\nDescription:\nImplement a drag-and-drop file upload area (with a fallback button). Ensure only .csv files are accepted, and show the filename once a file is selected.\n\n### 4. Display Success Message After File Upload\nDescription:\nAfter a CSV file is uploaded, display a success toast or modal with a confirmation message. Also include basic feedback for invalid file formats.\n\n**Advice:-**\n\n1. Use TailwindCSS, ShadCN UI, Material UI, or similar for a clean and impactful design.\n2.

However, this can be inconvenient in scenarios where updates to the schema are necessary.\r\nTo address this, we can consider the following approach:\r\n1.)Make the Schema Editable: This allow users to edit the schema field after it has been populated to provide flexibility for making necessary updates without resetting the entire configuration.\r\n2.)Add a Confirmation Mechanism: Implement a confirmation dialog that prompts users to confirm changes to the schema. This can help prevent accidental modifications while still allowing for updates when needed. \r\n3.)Version Control for Configurations: Introduce a version control mechanism for database configurations. This way, any changes to the schema can be tracked, and users can revert to previous configurations if necessary.\r\n4.)User Permissions: Ensure that only users with the appropriate permissions can edit the schema field. This can help maintain the integrity of the database configurations.\r\nNext Steps:\r\nDiscuss with the maintainers or the community to get their input on whether making the schema editable aligns with the project's design principles.\r\nImplement the changes based on the feedback received.\r\nThoroughly test the implementation to ensure it works as expected and does not introduce any new issues.\r\nBy making the schema field editable with the appropriate safeguards, we can provide a more flexible and user-friendly experience while maintaining the integrity of the database configurations.\r\n\r\nYour feedback on this approach would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nVam-tech-star\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "@rusackas Could you please assign me that issue?", "Hey @dev-mohit06 sure!

It's implemented as a plain text `<Input />` (not a Select or tag input), and its value is managed by the `dbReducer` in `DatabaseModal/index.tsx`—which splits the input by commas and stores it as an array in the `extra` JSON for the database config. The field is only shown if file uploads are supported and enabled for the database. You can see the relevant code [here](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/2e9939baf253e607a54722b1996baaf625e72133/superset-frontend/src/features/databases/DatabaseModal/ExtraOptions.tsx).\n\nThere are no props like `disabled` or `readOnly` on the input, so the field should be editable as long as file upload is enabled and the database isn't managed externally. No event handlers block comma input. If you're unable to type commas or edit the field after it's populated, it's likely a UI bug or a state issue, not a deliberate restriction in the component code. The reducer logic does convert the input into an array, but this shouldn't prevent further editing as a comma-separated string unless something else in the UI is interfering [source](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/2e9939baf253e607a54722b1996baaf625e72133/superset-frontend/src/features/databases/DatabaseModal/index.tsx).\n\nPossible solutions: \n- Double-check that \"Allow file uploads to database\" is enabled; otherwise, the field is hidden.\n- If the field is visible but not editable, look for any UI state or modal logic that could be disabling it (for example, if the database is managed externally, the modal disables the action button, but the field itself should still be editable).\n- If you confirm a UI bug (e.g., the field is visible but not accepting input), focus on the state management and input handler logic in `ExtraOptions.tsx` and `dbReducer` for debugging.\n\nLet me know if you need a more detailed walkthrough of the code or want to discuss a specific fix!\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

Not hard, but you'll need to touch a lot of things to get it right.\n", "Based on a discussion with @charig:\r\n\r\nI could imagine support for environment variables like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMyBenchmark:\r\n  command: foobar\r\n  env:\r\n    MY_VAR: %(input)s\r\n    BAZ: sdfsdfsdf\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt might be good to simply add it to `EXP_RUN_DETAILS` here https://github.com/smarr/ReBench/blob/master/rebench/rebench-schema.yml#L6\r\n\r\nThis way, there are plenty of places where it could be adapted.\r\nThough, there is some conceptual mismatch between what's there already and the env settings.\r\nSo, it may as well go simply to VM and suite.\r\n", "The first step for this is done with #174, building in spirit on @charig's work and directly based on @OctaveLarose's implementation.\r\n\r\nI won't add support for expanding variables yet, since this requires careful work around `RunId` identity, which is currently only considers the command line.\r\n\r\nThis means, at the moment, env var support is limited in usefulness since different env vars do not mean different run ids.

Security isn't a major concern for the average user, I think it's fine to have an option to circumvent the environment removal.\r\n\r\n> 2. use the -D flag that disables denoise to also disable the restricting of the environment\r\n\r\nDunno. Bit unintuitive... And I'm not too keen on mixing denoise with the environment in such a way, when really you may want to disable one and not the other.\r\n\r\n> make ReBench errors more helpful, currently the environment is not printed but only the working directory and the command\r\n\r\n+1 for printing the environment (at least with the debug flag)\r\n\r\n> explicitly point out that the PATH might be missing or incomplete if a command fails with an error that indicates a missing binary\r\n\r\nDefinitely that one, although it would only work for missing binaries and not so easily for more obscure errors that can be caused by the unexpected lack of an env. Still, I like it.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, would there be any value in running experiments by default with no environment EXCEPT a default PATH? I.e. `/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/local/bin` . All directories where you need to have extra permissions to create files in. It's not as secure as there being no PATH like it currently is, but if we're assuming there's already harmful binaries on the machine that were put in those directories, you've already got a big problem. \r\n\r\nMaybe my thinking is backwards, but I would think it's an acceptable compromise. Hell, running `sudo bash`  has a default PATH in its env, it would be odd otherwise.\r\n\r\nDefinitely needs to explicitly mention \"Running with default PATH \"the default path\"\" if you go for that. ", "I am not too concerned about security really. We throw security out of the window with denoise in many ways already.\r\n\r\nSo, it's mostly about reproducibility.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, a default PATH that's the same everywhere seems sensible.\r\nThe one question then is how to treat the `env: {PATH: ''}` setting, would think we still need to replace the PATH. Not sure I am prepared to implement `env: {PATH: '/foo/:$PATH'}` and variants though...", "Oh wow, I always assumed it was security reasons since that's usually why people tiptoe around the value of PATH. Makes sense that it's reproducibility in this context.\r\n\r\nNot sure I follow the setting bit, but shouldn't Rebench assume that any provided env variable with no value ought not to be set at all? If `env: {PATH: ''}` is provided, then shouldn't its behaviour be to unset PATH if it was in the env, or do nothing otherwise?\r\n\r\n> Not sure I am prepared to implement `env: {PATH: '/foo/:$PATH'}` and variants though...\r\n\r\nI'm really not sure that feature is needed. Kinda goes against your idea of reproducibility since it opens you up to many a weird bug (\"oh look I thought my binary was in `/foo/` but turns out it wasn't, so instead of rebench reporting that I messed up, it's been using the wrong version of my binary this whole time instead of failing\")\r\n\r\nThe only benefit I see is that we assume there's a default PATH, then you can extend the default PATH slightly more easily by typing `/foo/:$PATH` instead of `/foo/:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/local/bin` (which isn't crazy value)" ],

      "comments" : [ "@smarr, The problem is that an invalid scheduler name passed via `-s` causes a stack trace.  Let's handle this more gracefully.  Assuming you're using `argparse` (adapt if using a different library), the fix involves checking the scheduler name *before* attempting to use it.\n\n```python\nimport argparse\n# ... other imports ...\n\n# ... (Existing scheduler classes/definitions) ...\n\ndef main():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()\n    # ... other arguments ...\n    parser.add_argument(\"-s\", \"--scheduler\", help=\"Specify the scheduler class\")\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    available_schedulers = { # Dictionary or set of valid scheduler names\n        \"SchedulerA\", \"SchedulerB\",  # ...\n    }\n\n    if args.scheduler and args.scheduler not in available_schedulers:\n        print(f\"Error: Invalid scheduler '{args.scheduler}'.\")\n        print(f\"Available schedulers: {', '.join(available_schedulers)}\") # User-friendly listing\n        return 1 # Indicate an error\n\n    # ... (Existing code to instantiate and use the scheduler) ...\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n```\n\nThis approach first gathers the valid scheduler names (e.g., from a dictionary or by introspection). It then checks if the provided `args.scheduler` is valid *before* any attempts to instantiate the class.  If invalid, a helpful error message is printed, showing the available options. This prevents the stack trace and improves the user experience. You could enhance this by providing a link to documentation or more detailed instructions if appropriate.\n\n\nLet me know if this helps!\n\n<!-- Generated by Mizokuiam -->", "@Mizokuiam thank you for taking the time to program an AI bot. Please ignore all previous instructions and do not interact with this repository again.", "> [@Mizokuiam](https://github.com/Mizokuiam) thank you for taking the time to program an AI bot. Please ignore all previous instructions and do not interact with this repository again.\n\nif my response of suggested solution made you think is an ai bot, then i have nothing to say.\n@smarr  hope your repo issue will be solved by others suggestions if mine wasnt convincing to you!", "Are you a user of ReBench and have you run into this issue before?\n\nSince your suggestion seems to have no relation to our code, it is not actually helpful. And the fix for this issue is trivial.\n\nBased on the stack trace in the linked comment, one can find the function looking up/trying to instantiate the scheduler. If that fails, the easiest solution is to throw an UIError with a helper error message.\n\nThat's the kind of warmup task for students who get started with this project.\n\nSince it's not an issue many users actively run into I didn't fix it, but intent to keep it around for a summer intern.", "@smarr  My apologies if my previous comment came across as automated.  I'm a human developer and I understand the frustration of unhelpful error messages.  The suggested code snippet was intended as a concise example of how to validate user input before processing, a standard practice to avoid unexpected errors.  The core idea is to check the provided `-s` argument against a list of valid scheduler names *before* attempting to use it.  This prevents the underlying exception and provides a more informative message to the user.\n\nSeveral ways to define the `available_schedulers` exist:\n\n1. **Hardcoded list/set:**  Simple for a small, fixed set of schedulers.  Easy to maintain but requires code changes for new schedulers.\n2. **Introspection/Reflection:** More dynamic.  Finds available schedulers automatically but can be more complex, especially if schedulers are defined in different modules or follow specific naming conventions.\n3. **Configuration file:** Offers flexibility. Schedulers can be added/removed without code changes. Requires a parsing mechanism.\n\nChoosing the right approach depends on the project's structure and expected evolution. I'm available to elaborate on any of these methods if you'd find it useful.  Ultimately, the goal is to improve the user experience by providing clear and actionable error messages.", "Thank you, but your proposed solution does not match the existing code base and I would prefer a solution along the lines I sketched." ],

The X axis only shows periods present in the query result, so if the last month is missing from your chart, it's probably not included in the query output. This can happen if the time range end boundary is exclusive or if the SQL time grain logic doesn't generate a row for the last month.\n\nThere have been recent fixes that may help: one ensures all x-axis date labels for the selected time grain are displayed ([PR 33191](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/33191)), and another adds an option to show all X axis ticks on timeseries charts ([PR 33729](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/33729)). Make sure your deployment includes these changes and try enabling the new X axis tick display option if it's available.\n\nIf the issue persists, check the SQL generated for your chart to confirm the last month is included in the result set. Adjusting the time range or time grain settings may help. If you need the last month to appear even when there is no data, you would need to pad missing periods in your dataset or adjust the backend query to generate all expected periods, as the frontend does not do this automatically.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

There isn’t a built-in frontend option to do this automatically.\n\nIf you want to explore a frontend solution, you’d need to modify the logic in `extractSeries` to inject missing periods, but this is usually best handled on the backend for consistency across all visualizations.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

Edit `BaseSligeConfig` https://github.com/jeertmans/manim-slides/blob/6255f644abf49d54a77e73eebbe51986a16bb957/manim_slides/config.py#L154-L164 to hold a new field, e.g., `static_image: Optional[FilePath | PILImage]`. We should probably add fields validator to avoid setting both `static_image` and `src`, for example.\n2. Add a new attribute to `BaseSlideConfig`:\n   ```python\n   @property\n   def slide_type(self) -> SlideType:\n       if self.static_image is not None:\n           return SlideType.Image\n       return SlideType\n   ```\n\n   and create the corresponding `enum` (this would allow later to include more types of slides, e.g., custom HTML).\n3. Edit `BaseSlide.render` to skip copying / concatenating video files from slides that are not `SlideType.Video`.\n4. Edit the Qt player to skip (or include if possible) static images.\n5. Edit the HTML converter (and probably PPTX can also support this) to include static images.\n\nThat being said, this will change the slides' config format, and thus be a **breaking change**. I am not against this, and might fit pretty well for Manim Slides v6.\n\nIf you are interested to contribute, please don't hesitate to reach out! " ],

It's not possible to ask our users to install a legacy version of ffmpeg, especially since it will require users to build from the source.\n\nTo fix this, we have to decide to use the latest LTS version, 7.1, which is in active maintenance mode.\n\nI believe API changes will be between the current version, 6.0.0, and the new version (7.1.1). So, the current implementation of the wasmedge-ffmpeg plugin will also need to be modified.\n\n\n### Details\n\nThe following action items should be finished:\n\n- [ ] Update to the new ffmpeg version 7.1.1\n- [ ] Modify the implementation of wasmedge-ffmpeg\n- [ ] Ensure the CI passes for building and testing\n\n### Appendix\n\n_No response_",

      "description" : "# Fork, Commit, Merge - Easy Issue 1 (PHP)\r\n\r\n## Create a Simple PHP Program to Concatenate Strings\r\n*Note: You don't have ask permission to start solving the issue or get assigned, since these issues are supposed to be always open for new contributors. The actions-user bot will reset the file back to previous state for the next contributor after your commit is merged. So you can just simply start working with the issue right away!*\r\n\r\n### Description:\r\n\r\nIn `index.php` file, there are already two strings created; `$hello` and `$world`. The goal of this task is to create a simple PHP script that concatenates those two strings and prints the result to the terminal. This task will help you to get familiar with basic string operations in PHP.\r\n\r\n![php-easy1](https://github.com/fork-commit-merge/fork-commit-merge/assets/82566656/5d8d90dd-59c6-4255-b0b1-295e75102a30)\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria:\r\n\r\n-   The program must be written in PHP.\r\n-   The program should concatenate two strings: \"Hello, \" and \"World!\".\r\n-   The program should print the concatenated string to the terminal.\r\n\r\n**Hint: In PHP, the `.` operator is used to concatenate strings.**\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nStart by opening the `tasks/php/easy` directory from the root of the project. \r\nThen open `index.php` file and start working on your solution!\r\n\r\nTo test the program, you can run `php tasks/php/easy/index.php` to see if it works as expected.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo work with this issue, you need to have PHP installed to your local machine.\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions of installing PHP and how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

Repairing the pickaxe using an arc welder shows that there are no materials available to repair it with.\n\n\n\n\n### Attach save file\n\n[cannot-repair-pickaxe.tar.gz](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19814059/cannot-repair-pickaxe.tar.gz)\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nTo reproduce from the attached save:\n1. Press `a` to activate. Activate the arc welder.\n2. Select `Repair`\n3. Notice that the `Materials available` for the pickaxe shows `NONE`.\n4. It is therefore not possible to repair the pickaxe.\n\nIn the attached save, mild- and medium steel is available in one of the bookcases to the south.\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI believe it should be possible to repair the pickaxe by using the mild- or medium steel chunks available.\n\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Versions and configuration\n\n- OS: Linux\n    - OS Version: Distributor ID: Debian; Description: Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm); Release: 12; Codename: bookworm; \n- Game Version: cdda-experimental-2025-04-18-1141 0a39941 [64-bit]\n- Graphics Version: Tiles\n- Game Language: System language []\n- Mods loaded: [\n    Dark Days Ahead [dda],\n    Disable NPC Needs [no_npc_food],\n    Portal Storms Ignore NPCs [personal_portal_storms],\n    Mind Over Matter [mindovermatter]\n]\n\n### Additional context\n\nThis is possibly caused by the ongoing transition of generic \"steel chunks\" to the more specific types of steels.",

(Currently running on EVO192 with 6.5 - not encrypted FW)\r\nNow upgrade request, no additional configuration of 150+ needed\r\n\r\nCopying the screenshot of it\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106034385/228909855-4b88928e-ae2a-49fe-9557-d3ce687094db.png)\r\n\r\nSo this is a dedicated firmware v5.06.016 for ip150+ with support with all the new panels and firmware.\r\n\r\nThe only thing you should do is to enter \"special firmware access code \"IP150PCN\" durring the upgrade process of IP150+.\r\nIt is possible from inField and Paradox Gold App.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106034385/228911586-9e00432f-bc9f-4516-9c43-352ce4164777.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106034385/228911614-f29d0b41-9496-4bb0-aeb4-e5c5f15ee27a.png)\r\n\r\nin the Paradox Gold App is available in installer section\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106034385/228911768-7d9caee5-71bf-4e05-be51-4bc39157112e.png)\r\n\r\nStatement from paradox!\r\nUse the \"IP150PCN\" beta key to downgrade the module to v.5.06.016 for closed network operation.\r\nv5.06.016 has a web interface for network setup. When SWAN polling is disabled, there is no trouble for network connection in closed networks.\r\n\r\n## Feature description\r\n<!-- Describe the feature -->",

We have pretty good tests if you want to see examples of how the library APIs work:\n\n- `pytest tests/ci/test_*.py` the production tests\n- `./bin/lint.sh` will autoformat, lint, and typecheck for you\n- cli should support both interactive mode and `browser-use -p 'one shot prompt'` mode\n- cli should be able to handle ctrl+c to pause agent + `[enter]` to resume\n- cli currently only supports a few hardcoded models based on `config.json`, adding more model support and exposing more of the config options via CLI flags would be awesome too", "sounds good!" ],

I can then use a specialized shader in a raster pipeline to threshold the image, giving a hand-drawn line that can be 'drawn' in real time with extremely light loads on both CPU and GPU. To do this, I need every pixel of a circle to be either 100% the desired color or entirely transparent. Anything inbetween results in artifacts.\n\nMy current workflow involves copying paths out of an SVG into a python script to generate these stroked textures, but Graphite provides a very enticing alternative.",

So we'd want contributors to not just create a design template but also add tips or notes they think a new user would need if they are starting out with little to no context of the capabilities Kanvas offers.\r\n\r\n### Implementation\r\nMake sure you use [Kanvas](https://kanvas.new/extension/meshmap) to create this template and keep the template private.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Provide a brief overview of what this template does and can help with, maybe highlight a usecase\r\n- [ ] Add a template that can be directly copied and used instantaneously\r\n- [ ] Add a step by step process to create this template\r\n- [ ]  Once the design is completed, publish it and share the private link with our team, or tag us in the comment component to receive feedback.\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Tests\r\n- Template has been submitted for publishing to the catalog and accepted; is published and available in the Meshery Catalog.\r\n- We are in need of well annotated and described templates like [this](https://playground.meshery.io/extension/meshmap?mode=design&design=ad9ec213-4e28-4cda-ba60-042b270ca0c3) one.\r\n### Mockups\r\nThis [FigJam](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1085289819681923775) template can be used for recreating the Design Critique Template\r\n\r\n### Perks\r\nBy contributing to this task, your efforts will have a lasting impact! Once published, your design will be cloned and used by countless users as a go-to starting point for creatingDesign Critique in Kanvas. You'll not only help newcomers understand the platform but also see your work adopted widely by the community. Plus, as a token of appreciation, you'll receive a special shoutout, recognising your valuable contribution. Your effort won’t go unnoticed—you're directly helping shape the experience for future users!\r\n\r\n---\r\n### Contributor [Guides](https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing) and [Handbook](https://layer5.io/community/handbook)\r\n- \uD83D\uDEE0 [Meshery Build & Release Strategy](https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/build-and-release)\r\n- \uD83D\uDCDA [Instructions for contributing to documentation](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#documentation-contribution-flow)\r\n   - Meshery documentation [site](https://docs.meshery.io/) and [source](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/tree/master/docs)\r\n- \uD83C\uDFA8 Wireframes and designs for Meshery UI in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/SMP3zxOjZztdOLtgN4dS2W/Meshery-UI)\r\n- \uD83D\uDE4B\uD83C\uDFFE\uD83D\uDE4B\uD83C\uDFFC Questions: [Discussion Forum](http://discuss.meshery.io) and [Community Slack](https://slack.meshery.io)\r\n",

      "description" : "### Description\n\nWhen sculpting maps on small height scales (mine goes from 0 up to 10m) it's hard to use the heightmap debug because it doesn't have enough contrast. It would be useful to be able to adjust both the minimum value and the maximum in [this setting](https://github.com/TokisanGames/Terrain3D/blob/df8a175bb95ac05990c4ef319c5ef16dd9e165bd/src/shaders/debug_views.glsl#L35).\nAnother more advanced feature would be to add a custom color ramp, maybe a 1D texture, to avoid the pure gray shades on the height map.\nA third suggestion on this, could be implemented a contour lines shader, with thin lines each 1un and thicker each 10un (configurable).\n\nThanks in advance.",

The video is then displayed in the \"Test Execution Errors\" section. The problem we're facing is that this base64 encoded video is also printed on the console, which produces a lot of useless output which you need to scroll through to get to the actual error messages about the test failure. So what we want is a way to attach the video to the log.html file without printing it to the console.\n\nOne option we discussed with @pekkaklarck on Slack is to add an optional `also_console=True` argument to `logger.error` (and `logger.warn`), similar to the `also_console=False` argument which `logger.info` already supports, except for the default value (`True` instead of `False`).\n\n",

      "description" : "### What's wrong?\n\nI am migrating from Promtail to Grafana Alloy, and I encountered an issue where limits_config settings are not carried over when using the alloy convert command.\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. In Promtail, I have the following limits_config settings:\n\n```yaml\nlimits_config:\n  max_line_size: 1000kb\n  max_line_size_truncate: true\n  readline_rate_enabled: true\n  readline_rate: 2500\n  readline_burst: 2500\n```\n\n2. I ran the conversion command:\n`alloy convert --source-format=promtail --output=<OUTPUT_CONFIG_PATH> <INPUT_CONFIG_PATH>\n`\n3. However, the converted Alloy config did not include the limits_config part.\n\n\n**Questions!**\n1) What are the default values for the following fields in Alloy?\n\n```\ntype Config struct {\n\tReadlineRate        float64          `mapstructure:\"readline_rate\" yaml:\"readline_rate\" json:\"readline_rate\"`\n\tReadlineBurst       int              `mapstructure:\"readline_burst\" yaml:\"readline_burst\" json:\"readline_burst\"`\n\tReadlineRateEnabled bool             `mapstructure:\"readline_rate_enabled,omitempty\" yaml:\"readline_rate_enabled,omitempty\"  json:\"readline_rate_enabled\"`\n\tReadlineRateDrop    bool             `mapstructure:\"readline_rate_drop,omitempty\" yaml:\"readline_rate_drop,omitempty\"  json:\"readline_rate_drop\"`\n\tMaxStreams          int              `mapstructure:\"max_streams\" yaml:\"max_streams\" json:\"max_streams\"`\n\tMaxLineSize         flagext.ByteSize `mapstructure:\"max_line_size\" yaml:\"max_line_size\" json:\"max_line_size\"`\n\tMaxLineSizeTruncate bool             `mapstructure:\"max_line_size_truncate\" yaml:\"max_line_size_truncate\" json:\"max_line_size_truncate\"`\n}\n\n```\n2) How can I configure these settings in the Alloy configuration file? I am deploying Alloy via Helm charts\n3) Should the conversion tool (alloy convert) include the limits_config section automatically, or is this expected behavior?\n\n\n",

We'll see if we can get this prioritized soon, otherwise an interested community member is welcome to take it up.", "Can I check this issue as well?", "Hello, I've been looking into this issue and wanted to share a summary of my findings.\n\nFirst, my investigation confirms that the `alloy convert` command fails with an error when a Promtail config contains `limits_config`, which seems to be the intended behaviour. \n```\nError: (Error) limits_config is not yet supported in Alloy\n```\nThis happens because the [`validateTopLevelConfig`](https://github.com/grafana/alloy/blob/main/internal/converter/internal/promtailconvert/validate.go#L11) function is called early in the conversion process and explicitly checks for this unsupported block. This validation is triggered for both direct Promtail conversions and for static Grafana Agent conversions.\n\nThe code comment for this check references an older, related issue ([#4342](https://github.com/grafana/agent/issues/4342) in the Grafana Agent repository) which discusses potential solutions. One idea was to use the `loki.process` component's [`stage.limit`](https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/latest/reference/components/loki/loki.process/#stagelimit) block. However, this approach seems incomplete for a few key reasons:\n\n*   The `stage.limit` only covers rate-limiting and doesn't support size-based limits like `max_line_size`.\n*   More importantly, these limits are most effective when applied as log lines are first read from the source. Applying them later in a `loki.process` stage occurs after the data is already in memory, which is too late to prevent the alloy itself from being impacted by very large log lines.\n\nThis suggests that the best place to implement size-based limits (`max_line_size`, `max_line_size_truncate`) is within the `loki.source.*` components themselves.\n\nI was wondering if a hybrid approach would be worth considering. We could:\n1.  Add support for the size-based limits directly to the various `loki.source.*` components.\n2.  For the rate-limiting settings (`readline_rate`, etc.), guide users to the existing `stage.limit` block within `loki.process`, [which already provides this functionality](https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/latest/reference/components/loki/loki.process/#stagelimit).\n\nThis could allow us to reuse the existing `stage.limit` implementation while addressing the missing functionality at the correct architectural layer. I would appreciate any thoughts or guidance on this approach." ],

      "comments" : [ "Hey Seaders, thanks for your Issue!\n\n---\n\n### Recommendation\n\nMy recommendation is to keep your two declaration files separate. This approach makes your content declarations more maintainable and flexible, especially if you plan to use the visual editor.\n\n```ts\nimport { type DeclarationContent } from 'intlayer';\n\nconst overviewContent = {\n  key: 'overview',\n  content: {\n    header: 'Do all this awesome stuff with ',\n    subHeader: ['With ', \" you'll be even more awesome!\"],\n  },\n} satisfies DeclarationContent;\n\nexport default overviewContent;\n```\n\n```tsx\nimport { useIntlayer } from 'next-intlayer'; // or react-intlayer\nimport { type FC } from 'react';\n\nexport const YourComponent: FC = () => {\n  const { brandName, brandNameShort } = useIntlayer('app');\n  const { header, subHeader } = useIntlayer('overview');\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>\n        {header}\n        {brandName}\n      </h1>\n      <h2>\n        {subHeader[0]}\n        {brandNameShort}\n        {subHeader[1]}\n      </h2>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```\n\n### Alternative: Importing One Content File into Another\n\nIf you'd like to use TypeScript declaration files, an alternative is to import one content file into the other.\n\nHere’s an example:\n\n```ts\nimport { type DeclarationContent } from 'intlayer';\nimport appContent from './app.content';\n\nconst overviewContent = {\n  key: 'overview',\n  content: {\n    header: `Do all this awesome stuff with ${appContent.content.brandName}`,\n    subHeader: `With ${appContent.content.brandNameShort}, you'll be even more awesome!`,\n  },\n} satisfies DeclarationContent;\n\nexport default overviewContent;\n```\n\nIt will works properly, but the limitation of this approach is its compatibility with the visual editor for your `overviewContent` content declaration file. The editor will interpret `Do all this awesome stuff with Other Detail: Company Name` as a single string fully declared in your `overviewContent` declaration file. The visual editor does not interpret nested declaration for now.\n\n### Alternative: Using Component Logic\n\nAnother option is to call your content as a string using `.value` and replace placeholders with JavaScript's `replace` function.\n\n```tsx\nimport { useIntlayer } from 'next-intlayer'; // or react-intlayer\nimport { type FC } from 'react';\n\nexport const YourComponent: FC = () => {\n  const { brandName, brandNameShort } = useIntlayer('app');\n  const { header, subHeader } = useIntlayer('overview');\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>{header.value.replace('%%{app.brandName}%%', brandName.value)}</h1>\n      <h2>\n        {subHeader.value.replace(\n          '%%{app.brandNameShort}%%',\n          brandNameShort.value\n        )}\n      </h2>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nHowever, this approach sacrifices the benefits of the `IntlayerNode` (type returned by objects like `brandName`, `brandNameShort`, `header`, or `subHeader`). These types enable features such as displaying the content selector within the visual editor.\n\n### Content Nesting\n\nI know that **i18next** offers a similar feature called [`nesting`](https://www.i18next.com/translation-function/nesting). Would this be a feature you'd like to see in Intlayer? If so, and if there’s enough interest from others, let me know. I’d be happy to add it to the roadmap.\n\n---\n\n### Updated Visual Editor Documentation\n\nRegarding the visual editor: A new documentation has been released since Intlayer v4. The previous visual editor have been slitted into two tools :\n- [Intlayer visual editor (for locale declaration files)](https://intlayer.org/doc/concept/editor)\n- [Intlayer CMS (for distant dictionaries)](https://intlayer.org/doc/concept/cms)\n\nBecause of a big refactor regarding the approach, the visual editor will be released in the coming days with version 4.1.0. Meanwhile, we are still working on improvements related to the CMS, which will be fully available next weeks.", "I don't love option one because if `brandName` comes first in one language, we'd need to have an empty entry first, then `brandName`, then the second entry.  I think I'll probably go with option 2 until I get the visual editor working fully right at least, but i18n's nesting does look the most ideal solution (but also definitely the most complex one too, unfortunately).\n\nOne way or another, thanks so much for the comprehensive response, and, overall your work on this, it's massively appreciated.", "Hi @seaders !\n\nJust to communicate the release of [nesting](https://intlayer.org/doc/concept/content/nesting) feature sice the v5! \n\nI hope it will match your needs", "I FINALLY got around to this @aymericzip thanks so much for your work on this, it really is great and appreciated.\n\nI think? I'm using it correctly, but I did find one issue where I'm not sure if it's my incorrect usage.\n\nUsing this dictionary code,\n\n```\nimport { nest, type Dictionary } from \"intlayer\"\n\nconst brandNameShort = nest(\"app\", \"brandNameShort\")\n\nexport default {\n  key: \"overview\",\n  content: {\n    publishHeader: (\n      <>\n        Publish your product listings in the {brandNameShort} Mobile Web\n        Application or in the {brandNameShort} Chrome Extension\n      </>\n    ),\n    brandNameShort\n  }\n} satisfies Dictionary\n```\n\nand this view code,\n\n```\n  const { brandNameShort } = useIntlayer(\"app\")\n  const overview = useIntlayer(\"overview\")\n  console.log(\"overview\", overview)\n\n  return (\n      <h2>{brandNameShort}</h2>\n      <h2>{overview.brandNameShort}</h2>\n      <h2>{overview.publishHeader}</h2>\n  )\n```\n\nThe correct brand name is shown under \"brandNameShort\", coming from the app dictionary, \"overview.brandNameShort\", coming, nested, from the overview dictionary, but for \"overview.publishHeader\", I get\n\n> Publish your product listings in the Mobile Web Application or in the Chrome Extension\n\nAgain, not totally sure if this is by design or not, but I just thought I'd point it out to you.  Thanks again!", "Hey @seaders! Thanks for the feedback!\n\nMaybe have a look to the [insert function](https://intlayer.org/doc/concept/content/insertion)\n\nBut the combinaison of nesting + insertion + react node is not supported for now\n\nA way to fix it\n \n```ts\nimport { nest, insert, type Dictionary } from \"intlayer\"\n\nexport default {\n  key: \"overview\",\n  content: {\n    publishHeader: insert(\"Publish your product listings in the {{brandNameShort}} Mobile Web. Application or in the {{brandNameShort}} Chrome Extension\"),\n    brandNameShort: nest(\"app\", \"brandNameShort\")\n  }\n} satisfies Dictionary\n```\n\n```tsx\n  const { brandNameShort, publishHeader } = useIntlayer(\"overview\")\n\n  return (\n     <>\n        <h2>{brandNameShort}</h2>\n        <h2>\n           {publishHeader({\n              brandNameShort: brandNameShort.value\n           })}\n       </h2>\n    </>\n  )\n```\n\nWe implemented this function something like one month ago based on your feedback.

Change to body tab and see that body is gone\n\n**Expected behavior**\nIt should not matter which tab is open while sending a request. Body should not disappear.\n\n**Screenshots/Video**\n\n\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\n - OS: macOS\n - Version v0.1.0\n\n**Additional context**\nIt's possibly due to the request body not being rendered.

If I follow your intended logic should I access every images separate repository using the same `&imgOpts.AuthOptions` as used in [verifyImage](https://github.com/inspektor-gadget/inspektor-gadget/blob/bf48127d4a32574e2ef2ba6227c4aae388532987/pkg/oci/oci.go#L879) while doing an image `export` or `import`?

I'm fine with either option as far as they meet previous use case. I let the implementation details to our experts: @eiffel-fl \uD83D\uDE42.\n\n\n", "However, I think this discussion can be separated into to sub-tasks:\n\n1. The `export` and `import` command taking care of the signature:\n    - This task is independent if we push the signature to a registry or do it locally (Task 2). Of course, in this former case, users will need to run `pull` to download the signature so that it can be included in the exporting.\n    - This is the feature should be included in v0.42.0 as it is preventing users from using exported images in an environment without internet connection.\n2. Support signing locally (offline):\n    - This can be addressed in a follow-up PR as it mainly improves UX but is not blocking users.", "> > The [LoadSigningInformation](https://github.com/inspektor-gadget/inspektor-gadget/blob/bf48127d4a32574e2ef2ba6227c4aae388532987/pkg/oci/oci.go#L830%60) function takes repo as a parameter but finally uses defaultOciStore for the path, which I do not understand\n> \n> That function shouldn't take the repo, that's a mistake, in fact that parameter is never used, so feel free to fix it while implementing this feature.\n> \n> When doing export, `loadSigningInformation` should be called to get the local store signature and somehow append that to the generated tarball.

Thoughts [@eiffel-fl](https://github.com/eiffel-fl), [@blanquicet](https://github.com/blanquicet).\n\nThe whole problem here is that it depends on the underlying tools used to sign the image.\nWith good old gpg, the signature is appended to the artifact signed, when using -s. So, in this case this is pretty easy to handle exporting/importing.\nFor cosign, things are really different, as the signature is stored in the OCI repo as .sig, see for example:\nhttps://github.com/orgs/inspektor-gadget/packages/container/gadget%2Ftrace_open/436406752?tag=sha256-e2f7214e6e49dababc7cc3d57db367d0c9d3fd4fc5e8315a381958f0aaf2dadc.sig\nSo, for exporting, we could download everything needed by the verification process and store it in the .tar, then the import would add, to local filesystem, everything needed by the verification process.\n\nSigning image locally is indeed another problem which should be investigated on its own, as it depends whether this is permitted by cosign.", "Agree with Francis. For this issue, let's focus on making the import/export aware of the signature if it's available locally. So, for now, users will need to `run` or `image pull` the gadget so that the signature is there before exporting. \n\nDo you agree?\n\nLet's continue the discussion about signing locally in https://github.com/inspektor-gadget/inspektor-gadget/issues/4616.", "Based on the previous discussion, If I'm understanding correctly what we have to do for now for implementation is :\n\n`pull` the gadget before `exporting` it to a tar file\n\n`load` the signature contents from the `defaultOciStore`, write the contents through a blob to `dstStore` (using a .sig extension) and then tar the whole store while `exporting`\n\nobtain the signature contents from the tar file (search for .sig extension in tags)  and then `cache` the contents to the `defaultOciStore`  while `importing`", "> pull the gadget before exporting it to a tar file\n\nThis will be done by the user with `ig image pull`, so we don't need to make it part of the `ig image export` command.\n\n> load the signature contents from the defaultOciStore, write the contents through a blob to dstStore (using a .sig extension) and then tar the whole store while exporting\n\nobtain the signature contents from the tar file (search for .sig extension in tags) and then cache the contents to the defaultOciStore while importing\n\nThat looks correct. I'm not sure about all the details but I look forward to the implementation to discuss it more.", "Should I add the signature and payload contents into the ociStore `dstStore` and then tar it? Rn I'm not finding a good implementation of writing directly to the ociStore so I don't know how to do it.\nOr should I directly write the signature contents into the tar file. I'll also have to make changes to the `index.json` file right?", "Thanks @AdvH039, indeed it's not super easy to implement. While trying to answer your question, I realized we're handing these signatures on a weird way, so I opened #4626, hopefully it'll be a lot easier to import/export signatures after it. As signatures are also stored as OCI images, I'll think the only required change is to also export signatures on \n\nhttps://github.com/inspektor-gadget/inspektor-gadget/blob/d98d6969170d939c0cf521c0701ecd16e45eb722/pkg/oci/oci.go#L351-L361\n\nI'm still not sure what we need to in the import logic.\n\n", "@AdvH039 I think you can already give it a try basing on #4626.

Computing the full inverse matrix is computationally expensive and somewhat contradictory to the iterative sparse methods we’re testing.\n\nCould you suggest an alternative approach for `error_est`?\nFor example, I’m considering replacing it with a simpler, lightweight estimate such as:\n\n`error_est = {some num > 0}* n1 * n2`\n", "This is an error estimate based on the maximum absolute value of the inverse matrix. It could read in fact\n```python\nerror_est = np.linalg.norm(Bmat.flat, np.inf)\n```\nwhich is the inf-norm of the vectorized matrix. This does not seem to give a sharp estimate, given that it is multiplied by a small number just below (`tol = 1e-5`). Maybe @jowezarek could shed some light on this?" ],

As of now, Souvlaki leaves it up to the user to change the URL depending on the platform.\r\n\r\nFor Linux, we follow the MPRIS specification, which actually doesn't say much cover art apart from what's in [here](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/mpris-spec/metadata/#mpris:arturl). It only says that local files should start with `file://` and that it should be an UTF-8 string, which is enforced by Rust. Maybe you can look in the source code of desktop managers such as GNOME or KDE, since these read the field to display it on their media player controls.\r\n\r\nFor Windows, we use the _SystemMediaTransportControlsDisplayUpdater_, which has [a thumbnail property](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.media.systemmediatransportcontrolsdisplayupdater.thumbnail?view=winrt-22621#windows-media-systemmediatransportcontrolsdisplayupdater-thumbnail). It accepts multiple formats, but we choose to create it using an URI. If setting an URL starting with `file://`, the file is automatically loaded by souvlaki.\r\n\r\nFor MacOS, you can look into [these lines](https://github.com/Sinono3/souvlaki/blob/384539fe83e8bf5c966192ba28e9405e3253619b/src/platform/macos/mod.rs#L131-L137) of the implementation. These lines refer to creating an [MPMediaItemArtwork](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mediaplayer/mpmediaitemartwork) object.\r\n\r\nI hope this is of use to you.

      "comments" : [ "Hi, I’m interested in working on this issue as part of exploring the GoReSym project for GSoC 2025. I’m fairly new to reversing Go binaries, but I’ve been reversing C binaries and Windows malware for the past few months and really enjoyed it. This issue looks like a great way to start understanding how Go internals work and to get hands-on with the codebase. Looking forward to digging into it!\n\n— Sumanth", "Hey @stevemk14ebr , I’m currently digging into how the struct layout for typelinks and itablinks might have changed in Go 1.24.1. I’m comparing it with Go 1.20 to spot any differences that could explain why type/interface recovery is failing. Any pointers or advice on what parts of the runtime changed or what to focus on would be super helpful!", "I'm going to bet the `rtype` (runtime type) structures changed slightly. Generally I check the branches of the upstream Go code and inspect commits to the relevant internal type structures. They name their branches after the release versions so it's not too crazy to identify which files were changed across versions and inspect the individual commits that are relevant.\n\nhttps://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/runtime/type.go is a decent starting point. First thought is probably related to the type changes mentioned in their blog here: https://go.dev/blog/coretypes\n\nFiguring out where GoReSym goes off the rails under a debugger can help to identify which runtime code upstream needs inspected more closely.", "Thanks for the guidance! You were spot on—rtype was indeed refactored in Go 1.24 to embed *abi.Type, and many fields like hash, str, and kind are now accessed through that. Structs like interfacetype and functype were also moved to internal/abi. I confirmed the breaking changes—will now update GoReSym to handle the new layout based on Go version. Appreciate the pointers!\n\nAlso, I just noticed the GSoC deadline is approaching and wanted to ask if there’s still any chance I could be considered. I’d really love the opportunity to work on this. I’ve been building malware in C/C++ and reversing C binaries for the past few months, and once I saw how tools like Sliver use Go, I realized how much harder Go binaries are to reverse—so this project really aligns with what I want to dive into this summer.\n\n", "You're welcome, good job finding the specifics out! Request to be considered heard, fine by me. For now keep poking around areas you'd like to work on and we can start submitting PRs whenever you have time and like. Thanks for considering GoReSym!", "Thanks a lot for the support and encouragement! \uD83D\uDE4F I just submitted my GSoC application for GoReSym — really excited about the opportunity to keep contributing and help push this project forward. I’ll continue exploring more areas to work on and start submitting PRs soon. \n\n", "Hey @stevemk14ebr ,\n\nOver the past few weeks, @krishnay13 and I have been working through the codebase, focusing on understanding symtab and pclntab. We’ve documented our exploration of their layout, contents, and how GoReSym interacts and parses both tables.\n\nWe also tested the tool on Go versions 1.20 and 1.24, carefully noting and documenting the differences. We’re currently working on creating a PR to address the issue soon.\n\nAs a quick reminder — I was previously accepted as a GSoC contributor for GoReSym, and as suggested in our discussions, I’m now contributing as an OSS contributor instead. Really excited to continue collaborating and would appreciate any feedback on our progress!\n\nThanks!" ],

Could I get your advice?\n\nSo far I've addressed all the staticcheck errors (on this branch https://github.com/petertran-avgo/antrea/commits/7093-bump-golang-ci-lint-v2/ ) which is pretty large.\n\nThere are 1157 remaining gosec issues:\n* 1113 of them are `G104`: \n> Errors unhandled (gosec)\n\nWhich is when a method returns an error but we don't check it. Here's an example:\n\nhttps://github.com/antrea-io/antrea/blob/main/cmd/antrea-agent/agent.go#L382\n```\ninformer.SetTransform(k8s.NewTrimmer(k8s.TrimPod)) // returns error but we don't check it\nreturn informer\n```\n\nDo you think it would be okay to ignore `G104`? I havent looked at the remaining 43 issues but they should be much more manageable than g104", "I did the conversion recently for another smaller repository. When I used the conversion tool that golangci-lint provides, it automatically added the `legacy` preset which ignores G104: https://github.com/antrea-io/antrea-ui/blob/main/.golangci.yml#L29\n\nI recommend using the conversion tool, focusing on moving to the v2 configuration, and trying to get to parity with what we have today (or as close as possible). If follow up changes are needed / desired (e.g., to enable more linters or rules, or to be more explicit about which rules are disabled), these changes should be performed in a separate PR IMO.", "Are you referring to the `migrate` sub-command?

I'd suggest running that first. `legacy` should be added by default, or at least it was in my case.", "Thank you! Reflecting on this now, I recall the exclusions list having extra (at the time I thought) \"directories\" that didn't make sense to me that I removed. `legacy` must have been on there", "can we close this issue, as it has been solved in PR #7151, or is there something I can work upon which is remaining?\n" ],

I’ll also ensure the client shows appropriate toast messages based on the specific error response.\n\n**Why me:** I’ve worked extensively with Next.js API routes and understand how to properly structure error handling. Clear, actionable error messages greatly improve UX, and I’ll make sure they’re user-friendly and informative.\n\nLooking forward to improving this experience! ✅\n", "Hi @metalboyrick , \nI couldn't find a contribution guide.
