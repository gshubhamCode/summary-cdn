This breaks Pydantic validation and causes all tools to disappear from the Tools page.\n\nTo fix it, check your tool metadata (YAML files for built-in tools, or database entries for custom/API tools) and make sure every i18n object has a valid, non-null string for `en_US`???even an empty string is acceptable. After correcting any missing or null values, restart your backend.\n\nRecent changes to i18n files in Dify 1.6.0 may have introduced this issue, so it's worth reviewing any recent updates to your tool definitions or translations as well??[cite](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/21459).\n\nIf you have a lot of tools, consider writing a quick script to scan for missing or null `en_US` fields in your tool configs before restarting. This should resolve the validation error and restore the Tools page.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

There is no decompiled code for us to use!\n\nInstead, we should use this logic: when we see a `<file>.pyc` import, but no non-`pyc` candidate, we should automatically perform the work of `replace_import_with_any`.\n\nWe'll likely want to do that by updating the [`FindResult`](https://github.com/facebook/pyrefly/blob/fffb8477b0ce8d4cb4eff311db2589fa3564c90d/pyrefly/lib/module/finder.rs#L33) to add a new variant for `.pyc` results, which when searching are lower precedence than `.pyi`, but higher than `NamespacePackages`.\n\nWe should also update the [configuration documentation](https://github.com/facebook/pyrefly/blob/fffb8477b0ce8d4cb4eff311db2589fa3564c90d/website/docs/configuration.mdx?plain=1#L265) to mention that we do this, since this behavior might be unexpected.\n\n---\n\nYou can test this yourself with the following: \n1. `uv venv venv && source venv/bin/activate && pip install requests && cd $(python3 -c \"import site; print(site.gesitepackages()[0])\")/requests`\n    - Note: this attempts to cd into the site directory that `requests` was installed into. If it was the wrong site package directory, then inspect other `site.getsitepackages()` directories to find the `requests` directory.\n2. `python3 -m compileall *`\n    - Note: you can also have the same effect as this by passing in `--compile` to `pip install requests`\n4. `rm *.py && mv __pycache__/* . && rm -rf __pycache__`\n5. `python3 -c 'import os; [os.rename(file, \".\".join([part for part in file.split(\".\") if \"cpython\" not in part])) for file in os.listdir()]'`\n\nThe above should set up requests to look like a compiled library.",

      "description" : "## What would you like to be added:\r\n\r\nUno Platform implementation of `EmailManager` currently does not support e-mail attachments. The problem is that Andorid and iOS support file-based attachments only, however UWP API is fully based on streams. There would be two options:\r\n\r\n- **Take the stream, write to file, use that file as an attachment, then clean it up \"sometime\" afterward** - as it means the API would eat up storage space, which could potentially be in MB range, and there would have to be a check to clean it up even in case something fails. Ideally the file should be stored in the `ApplicationData.Current.TemporaryFolder`, as that one should get cleaned up by the system automatically\r\n- **Add some Uno-specific methods, that would allow adding file-based attachments** - this API could be either Android and iOS specific, or it could exist as a universal extension method, that would work on UWP as well, so it could be truly cross-platform.\r\n\r\n## Why is this needed:\r\n\r\nTo send files with e-mail. It is often used for sending crash-dumps.\r\n\r\n## For which Platform:\r\n\r\n- [x] iOS\r\n- [x] Android\r\n- [ ] WebAssembly\r\n- [ ] WebAssembly renderers for Xamarin.Forms\r\n- [ ] macOS\r\n- [ ] Windows\r\n- [ ] Build tasks\r\n- [ ] Solution Templates",

And the deletion after sending should fail only occasionally anyway.", "Sure, some remarks in the xml doc of # 1 drawing attention to # 2 (and vice versa) would make sense.\r\n\r\nFor the backup cleanup - maybe do it the next time the app tries to send an email attachment?

I could reproduce this on two devices with an uneven mix of different iOS- and device-versions, third party mail apps and a lot of tough luck.) \r\n\r\nHence my suggestion is to not adopt the same mistake and let the user know of that case, perhaps through throwing an exception when an attachment is passed but the fallback initiated.", "A possible workaround is to use MAUI essentials, until uno supports `EmailManager`.", "Hey there ??? just a heads-up that this issue has been quiet for over a year.

This is a great opportunity to test my abilities.", "@wesleykebrown Sounds great!", "I've been working on this for a while locally and wanted to ask some questions!\n\nQuestions I have for solution paths:\n\n1. Could the tests be modified to use `pollToPromise`?\n1. With the image urls, there's a nested call in generated functions from `createTexture2DUpdateFunction` ([here](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/blob/main/packages/engine/Source/Scene/Material.js#L787C10-L787C39)]. When interacting with `_loadedImages`, this function's path can either be synchronous or asynchronous. The asynchronous path has potentially multiple `.then` calls, which is probably what's causing the test issue. For improving this, should this and its parent functions be refactored to have a split async/sync path depending on if there's a \"url\" passed as an arg to a constructor? This would be a lot of refactoring.\n1. The variant of above is making every function async and returning the promise chains but that's even worse.\n\n<details>\n<summary>\nQuestions I have for code understanding in this starbucks (hidden cuz its like, optional and I'm fun)\n</summary>\n\n1. I've been reading the [coding guide](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/blob/main/Documentation/Contributors/CodingGuide/README.md) & I wanted to ask where this `Material` falls in the range of low-level to high-level\n1. From the coding guide, it suggests writing code similar to what already exists. Unfortunately, for the `fromUrl` results in the repo, they're wildly different implementations. Mine more closely resembles [the more recently updated one of them](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/blob/main/packages/engine/Source/Scene/SingleTileImageryProvider.js), but it is postfixed with `Provider`, and I wasn't sure if that had any implications\n1. I saw in the op the example fix has a parameter structure breaking with the `fromUrl` tradition: having `url` be the first param. Would it be ok to have `url` be the first param or was that intended as its considered `image` as a nested property within the `Material` spec?\n1. Also looking at other implementations of fromUrl, they're all public. Since the intention here is for improving testing, would it make sense to break from that here and have it be private or no?\n</details>\n\nThanks", "we are actually facing a similar challenge, but in a custom material using fabrics. would your solution also work for this?\n\ni hacked a quick prototype where i used an `imageLoaded` event that would emit on `update` for every loaded image with the uniformId. the benefit of this, i thought, was a) that i can change the uniform and wait for the new texture to be loaded again without having to create a new material and b) the code changes where minimal: a total of three lines. BUT, you have to actually call update on the material. \n\nmaybe there is an inbetween solution that could take care of both the `await Material.fromUrl('my.png')` and `new Material({ fabric: { type: 'MyFabric', uniforms: { tex: myCanvas }, source: '' } })`. ", "If the only purpose of `Material.fromUrl` is to make unit testing easier, why don't we instead make some sort of `imageReady` flag and event that Material creators can listen for? Unit tests could enter a poll loop on the ready flag, or register a listener which performs the `expects` validation steps.\n\nI could see it being useful in other places in the codebase to have a flag that indicates an image is loaded. On the other hand - do we have use cases where we'd want to asynchronously load an image from a URL?", "This sounds related to (although not \"the same as\") the changes that had been done in https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/blob/main/CHANGES.md#1107---2023-07-03 . There, the move was generally to change existing cases of \"ready flags\" and events into actual promises, but no strong opinion on the `Material.fromUrl` case from my side.\n ", "I see. In that case, maybe we should just store an array of promises (of images to load) in the material class, and expose a public getter so that users can await those promises? Users can continue to make materials as before - via the constructor or `.fromType` - but can subsequently await the images loading.\n\nWe could also then allow users to (optionally) pass in functions to call on resolving the promise, etc.", "I might be lacking some context for the Material API in particular. It sounds like the suggested `Material.fromUrl` function is not _necessarily_ intended _only_ for tests, but could also be useful in other contexts. Conversely, people might want to have finer control, to optionally wait for (and/or be informed about) the image loading process, but I might be lacking the imagination about why they could want this. For the example of\n```\n  primitive.appearance.material = Material.fromType(\"Image\", { \n    image: \"./Data/Images/Blue.png\"\n  });\n```\nit looks like it can hardly make sense to use this material _without_ the image (this could cause... you know... some white flashing and such \uD83D\uDE2C ). But I think that images can also be \"composed\" and contain _multiple_ external images, and being able to track this with dedicated promises for each image sounds pretty involved (for the implementation, _and_ for the client who wants to use it).\n\nFrom the description until now, it sounds like a \"blanket\"-function like `fromType`**`Async`** could make sense: It creates whatever has to be created, returns a promise, and when it's done, it's done. But maybe there are use-cases for the \"fine-grained\" promises as well.\n", "> dedicated promises for each image sounds pretty involved\n\nIs it? If the `Material` class holds an array of image promises that's gettable, couldn't the user simply `Promise.all(theArray)` to wait for all of them?", "I'm not necessarily arguing against an async constructor, for what it's worth. Just playing devil's advocate to try to understand *exactly* what we want here, before wasting effort building something we don't.\n\nI do think something like `.fromTypeAsync` would be nice to have as part of the Material interface. It *will* be a larger refactor effort, though (an overdue one, to be fair).", "> couldn't the user simply `Promise.all(theArray)` to wait for all of them?\n\nSure, but then I'd ... (also play devil's advocate, and) ... ask a few questions \uD83D\uDE42 \n\nFrom the user's perspective, when the user wants to wait, as in \"Just give me that material!\", then there are these options:\n```javascript\nconst material = await Material.fromTypeAsync(type, { ... });\n```\nvs.\n```javascript\nconst material = Material.fromType(type, { ... });\n\n// Important: Wait for it!\nawait Promise.all(material.getImagePromises());\n```\nIt's a tad less convenient, and new users could easily miss that call. \n\nAnd... does the material even _contain_ images? Maybe, maybe not. That array of promises might be empty...\n\nAlso, offering that array of promises is exposing something that - to my very limited understanding of how that API is commonly used  - could very well remain hidden, unless there is a _strong_ reason why a user should _explicitly_ be able to do something like\n`material.getImagePromises()[42].then(...);`\n(And I can hardly imagine why a user should want to do that - maybe I'm overlooking something...)\n\n(The case where a user does something like `material.getImagePromises()[42] = undefined;` may look contrived, but for the sake of \"information hiding\" etc., it may be worth mentioning that this would be _possible_)\n\nEven _if_ this array is accessible: The user does not even _know_ what each element of this array represents. I'd have to dig through https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/wiki/Fabric and try out a few things, but from my understanding there can be materials that involve multiple images...\n```\n{ \n    imageA: \"./Data/Images/Red.png\"\n....\n    imageB: \"./Data/Images/Blue.png\"\n}\n```\nWill the array of promises contain the promises of each of them, in declaration order? \n\n---\n\nNote that I'm also not (strongly) arguing for or against one thing, except for the \"high-level\" points:  \n\n1. the API should be _easy to use_, and _hard to misuse_\n2. when in doubt, leave it out\n\n", "\uD83D\uDC4D\uD83C\uDFFB I buy it :) Will update this thread when I have a better understanding of the refactoring that would be necessary to make an async material constructor.", "Don't spend time and effort until this is confirmed. I'm not making decisions. I'm not arguing. I'm just trying to lay out pros and cons.\n", "Just some thoughts as I'm going through the Material API (will probably edit this comment as I have more):\n- A material can have submaterials. If a material is created via `fromTypeAsync`, I think that implies the submaterials would have to be handled similarly... recursively. That's pretty challenging, as submaterials are created from the Material constructor itself, which cannot be marked async.\n- The solution here needs to continue to allow users to change material textures. \n- The solution should make it easy to add other asynchronous operations to `Material.js` that need to be waited on in an async constructor, in the future.\n- Would be nice if the solution did not duplicate code / might require refactoring out loading logic into more easily callable functions.\n- Is the solution acceptably \"async\" if it requires that the `Material` have an `Update` call before being truly \"ready\"?\n- What do we do about `HTMLVideoElement`, `OffscreenCanvas`, etc. that aren't explicitly fetched in Material.js?", "So, this is more challenging than I anticipated, but not impossible. It just requires making some design choices that I'd like input on.\n\nLet me lay out the challenge first. There are currently two operations that are asynchronous in `Material` - loading images for 2D textures, and for cubemaps. They both occur via functors that are called from the `Update` loop. For example [this function](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/blob/668c2050e19756a0effbd0ddaa613a350dbf30b3/packages/engine/Source/Scene/Material.js#L787-L789) creates a function which is called every Update to potentially load new images, if uniforms have changed.\n\nSo, the asynchronous parts of Material aren't even kicked off on construction - they're kicked off on the first update. This makes it hard to extract them into async functions that can be called in an async constructor.\n\nHere are three approaches I've considered:\n1. We extract the image loading logic into async functions, and call those explicitly in a new async constructor. \n2. We create a `ready` flag and event, which gets set / fires when everything is loaded the first time. The async constructor returns a promise which resolves on this event. To the user, it just looks like a regular promise that can be `await`'ed.\n3. We mark `initializeMaterial` (and downstream calls all the way to `createUniform`) as `async`, and after [creating each updater function](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/blob/668c2050e19756a0effbd0ddaa613a350dbf30b3/packages/engine/Source/Scene/Material.js#L1061), we immediately call and `await` it. The constructor would *not* `await` the `initializeMaterial` function (it can't since it's a constructor, but it shouldn't anyway). Instead, it stores the promise as a member variable. The new async constructor can await this promise.\n\nThe first approach sounds appealing because it doesn't require a ready flag/event pattern, but the logic in the uniform updaters (like `createTexture2DUpdateFunction`) is so complex that it would be really hard to do without any regressions. It's also not very future-proof; adding new async ops to Material would require adding them to the async constructor as well. I briefly tried this approach but got the ick as the rabbit hole of refactoring went ever deeper.\n\nThe second approach is honestly not bad, imo. It's probably the simplest in terms of refactoring, but ready flags are apparently an anti-pattern we're trying to move away from.\n\nI think the third approach is the cleanest, and I tried doing something in this vein until I realized that one of the updater's requires `context`, which is only available in `Update` - ugh! If it's possible to extract the (limited) need for `context`, this is what I'd want to do. [Here's the only use that's really blocking](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/blob/668c2050e19756a0effbd0ddaa613a350dbf30b3/packages/engine/Source/Scene/Material.js#L817-L820)." ],

Create a warning (maybe error) message that the user specified a branch name instead of static reference (i.e., commit hash or tag).

Possible configure slowdown, as aui boot would constantly check for updates on dependencies whose version is specified by a branch.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I prefer static referencing instead of branches because you 100% sure that if you open the project in the future you would not encounter compile error messages because some of dependencies received updates. This is also how git submodules work, and I'm sure there's the reason on why they forcing to use static references.

In addition to regular public and regional holidays, there have been several one-off or special occasion holidays in the past???such as:\n\n26 May 2017 ??? Ratting Day (Tristan da Cunha)\n\n3 June 2022 ??? Queen Elizabeth II???s Platinum Jubilee\n\nSome of these events are specific to particular years and are not regularly recurring, often originating from royal or national observances or local decisions. I???ve come across references indicating that holiday ordinances were issued as far back as 1948. However, compiling a reliable list of such historical holidays has proven challenging.\n\nI searched extensively for authoritative sources that include holiday data for Saint Helena prior to 2015. Unfortunately:\n\nWebsites like [Timeanddate.com](https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/?year=2015&country=170) only list holidays from 2015 onward.\n\nI have not been able to find digitized legal documents or official calendars issued before 2015 that include these holidays.\n\nLocal archives or legal gazettes seem to be the only possible sources, but they aren???t accessible online or are very hard to track down.\n\nMy question is:\nIn cases where no verifiable and complete source is available for historical holidays (pre-2015), how should we proceed in the holidays package?\n\nIs it acceptable to include only holidays from 2015 onward, based on verifiable sources like timeanddate.com and other references mentioned above?\n\nShould we attempt to add known one-off events (like Ratting Day or Jubilee holidays) if at least some documentation exists, even if others remain undocumented?\n\nOr should we avoid including uncertain or unverifiable holidays altogether until proper historical data can be sourced?\n\nI want to make sure my contribution follows the best practices of the project and doesn???t compromise data quality or consistency. I???d really appreciate your advice on how to handle this situation.\n\nThanks so much for your time and guidance!", "> Is it acceptable to include only holidays from 2015 onward, based on verifiable sources like timeanddate.com and other references mentioned above?\n\nYes, it's better to have a shorter period, but a reliable one.\n\n> Should we attempt to add known one-off events (like Ratting Day or Jubilee holidays) if at least some documentation exists, even if others remain undocumented?\n\nRatting Day is annual holiday, it's just proclaimed separately each year.

      "comments" : [ "# :wave: Important: PLEASE READ :wave:\n\nThis issue has been labeled as a **good first issue** and is available for anyone to work on.\n\nIf this is your first time contributing to an open source project, some aspects of the development process may seem unusual, arcane, or some combination of both.\n\n1.  **You cannot \"claim\" issues.** People new to open source often want to \"claim\" or be assigned an issue before beginning work. The typical rationale is that people want to avoid wasted work in the event that someone else ends up working the issue. However, this practice is not effective in open source, as it often leads to \"issue squatting\", in which an individual asks to be assigned, is granted their request, and then never ends up working on the issue. Accordingly, you are encouraged to communicate your intent to address this issue, ideally by providing a rough outline as to how you plan to address the issue or asking clarifying questions, but, at the end of the day, we will take running code and rough consensus in order to move forward quickly.\n2.  **We have a very high bar for contributions.** We have very high standards for contributions and expect all contributions???whether new features, tests, or documentation???to be rigorous, thorough, and complete. Once a pull request is merged into stdlib, that contribution immediately becomes the collective responsibility of all maintainers of stdlib. When we merge code into stdlib, we are saying that we, the maintainers, commit to reviewing subsequent changes and making bugfixes to the code. Hence, in order to ensure future maintainability, this naturally leads to a higher standard of contribution.\n\nBefore working on this issue and opening a pull request, please read the project's [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md). These guidelines and the associated [development guide](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/docs/contributing/development.md) provide important information, including links to stdlib's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), license policy, and steps for setting up your local development environment.\n\nTo reiterate, we **strongly** encourage you to refer to our contributing guides **before** beginning work on this issue. Failure to follow our guidelines significantly decreases the likelihood that you'll successfully contribute to stdlib and may result in automatic closure of a pull request without review.\n\nSetting up your local development environment is a critical first step, as doing so ensures that automated development processes for linting, license verification, and unit testing can run prior to authoring commits and pushing changes. If you would prefer to avoid manual setup, we provide pre-configured [development containers](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/tree/develop/.devcontainer) for use locally or in GitHub Codespaces.\n\nWe place a high value on consistency throughout the stdlib codebase. We encourage you to closely examine other packages in stdlib and attempt to emulate the practices and conventions found therein.\n\n-   If you are attempting to contribute a new package, sometimes the best approach is to simply copy the contents of an existing package and then modify the minimum amount necessary to implement the feature (e.g., changing descriptions, parameter names, and implementation).\n-   If you are contributing tests, find a package implementing a similar feature and emulate the tests of that package.\n-   If you are updating documentation, examine several similar packages and emulate the content, style, and prose of those packages.\n\nIn short, the more effort you put in to ensure that your contribution looks and feels like stdlib???including variables names, bracket spacing, line breaks, etc???the more likely that your contribution will be reviewed and ultimately accepted. We encourage you to closely study the codebase **before** beginning work on this issue.\n\n:sparkles: Thank you again for your interest in stdlib, and we look forward to reviewing your future contributions. :sparkles:\n" ],

The issue is with every ReorderableListView, but the following makes it easy to see, as follows:\r\n````dart\r\nExpanded(\r\n  ReorderableListView(\r\n    children: List.generate(10, (index) => Container(\r\n      key: ValueKey('abcd-$index'),\r\n      width: 250,\r\n      height: 150,\r\n      color: Colors.lightBlue,\r\n      margin: EdgeInsets.symmetric(vertical: 20, horizontal: 25),\r\n    )),\r\n    onReorder: (oldIndex, newIndex) {},\r\n  )\r\n)\r\n`````\r\n3. Long press on any of the children of the ReorderableListView and you will see that a box shadow is applied to the border around the margin of the child that was long pressed. \r\n\r\n**Expected results:** The shadow or animation shown by the ReorderableListView surrounds the actual child without including the margin of the child.\r\n\r\n**Actual results:** The shadow or animation shown includes the margin of the child. \r\n\r\nSince it is not possible to define padding or separators for the ReorderableListView's children (unlike with the ListView.separated variant), I would have expected the margin to be respected by the ReorderableListView. Currently i do not know how to avoid this problem.\r\n\r\nScreenshot showing the shadow around the margin:\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25553592/109020765-8c040380-76ba-11eb-8b6c-631e5172a846.png\" width=\"300\" />",

Wish there was a method similar to ListView.separated for ReorderableListView.", "Yeah, there is no way the list view can know that the padding or margin you are putting in each item is something that you want to exclude from the dragged item.  The real solution as suggested is to have a ReorderableListView.separated constructor (I updated the issue title accordingly).\r\n\r\nI took a quick look at implementing this with just a widget builder wrapper that inserted divider widgets between the children. It sort of works, but causes issues during the item drag, as the usual gap that is shown between items will overlap with where the dividers go.

Like a way to let the developer somehow change the separators appearance when dragging? \r\n\r\nThanks for your help", "I want to work on this issue.

A suggested fix is to separate the outputs into two folders:\n\n* `src/domains/abis/` ??? for Paladin contracts\n* `src/domains/zeto-abis/` ??? for Zeto contracts\n\nThis will prevent collisions and make the boundary between the two clearer.\n",

Move isRevertReasonEnabled to EVMConfiguration:\r\n   - Add a new field isRevertReasonEnabled in the EVMConfiguration class\r\n   - Implement getter and setter methods for this field\r\n\r\n2. Update BesuCommand and BesuController:\r\n   - Remove direct handling of isRevertReasonEnabled in BesuCommand\r\n   - Modify BesuController to initialize and manage this flag using EVMConfiguration\r\n\r\n3. Modify TransactionReceiptFactory:\r\n   - Update methods to use EVMConfiguration for checking the isRevertReasonEnabled flag\r\n   - Combine the two factory methods into one, where the revert reason is included or excluded based on EVMConfiguration\r\n\r\n4.

Thank you for your consideration.", "@bomanaps Do not, under any condition, add it to `EVMConfiguration`.  Do some more studying of where and how the flag is used.  EVMConfiguration should only be for options used by the `:evm` module, and it isn't used there.  In fact, you will discover that the flag is only ever used in the `ProtocolSpec`\r\n\r\nAdding it to `DataStorageConfiguration` would be a better place.  Then `MainnetProtocolSpecs` and `ClassicProtocolSpecs` can replace the two fields `enableRevertReason` and `isParallelTxProcessingEnabled` parameters being passed around with the single `DataStorageConfiguration` Object.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe could move `chainId` into `EVMConfiguration`, that refactoring would make sense.

Then I'll systematically work through the provided checklist, creating tests for basic rendering, prop variations, event handling, edge cases, and accessibility compliance. I'll follow the established testing patterns from `AutoScrollToTop.test.tsx` and other component tests in the project to ensure consistency with your testing standards.\n\n**Background:** I recently completed comprehensive unit tests for the ActionButton component (PR pending review) where I successfully covered all checklist items including conditional rendering, prop-based behavior, event handling, edge cases, and accessibility testing. I'm familiar with the project's testing setup, mocking strategies, and code quality requirements.\n\nI'm confident I can deliver thorough, well-structured tests that provide meaningful coverage and follow the project's established patterns. Would you be willing to assign this issue to me?\n\nThanks!" ],

I was going through the codebase and I noticed the test case 'Should not return an ExternalLink in jsx + rich mode if there's click behavior', which seems to suggest it's not a traditional anchor-based navigation. \nIs the element in question intended to perform a real navigation (e.g., to an external URL), or is it meant to trigger a custom action or internal behavior?\nIf it's not a traditional anchor-based navigation, are we expected to use a non-anchor element styled like a link, but still make it accessible via ARIA roles/keyboard behavior?\n\n\nWould love to understand the intended UX pattern here before working on the fix.

You can use the Measure Tool to get a reliable length, but it is a little bit quirky. The best method I???ve found is to build a yard with straight track on an incline, then place three of the same type frames as close together as you can get them.\n\nUsing three instead of just two is important, because the game sometimes doesn???t save rolling stock at their exact position. The extra frame will let you take a second measurement for verification. If the two measurements don't match, you might need to try moving the frames in the game to get a good measurement.\n\n\n<img width=\"515\" height=\"1259\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f69f6dd3-7fab-4252-9c10-9c9576010d21\" />" ],

Then I'll dive into the <ActionButton> component itself to map out all its props, behaviors, and potential edge cases. My approach will be to systematically work through the checklist you've provided, starting with basic rendering tests and building up to more complex scenarios like event handling, state changes, and accessibility compliance.\nI have solid React experience and understand component behavior well, so I'm confident I can create comprehensive tests that properly cover all the scenarios outlined in your checklist. I'll make sure the tests are clean, well-documented, and follow the same quality standards as your existing test suite.\nWould you be willing to assign this issue to me? I'm excited to contribute meaningful test coverage that will help maintain the reliability of this component.\nThanks!\n\nRizwaan | GSSoC Contributor", "Hi @kasya  @arkid15r ,\n\nI've completed the unit tests for the ActionButton component and created a pull request: #[1825]\n\nThe tests cover all items from the checklist with comprehensive coverage including edge cases and accessibility testing.

      "comments" : [ "This is a good idea to speed up every call to `max` (and `min`). Furthermore in the particular case of softmax I think the nan checks could be avoided entirely since even if the max were non-nan the resulting softmax still will be nan due to the later sum, so propagation happens automatically. In that case we'd prefer a true `fmaxf`-style max computation with no nan check (like `torch.fmax` instead of `torch.maximum`). We could provide two different binary ops for each of min and max and add a `propagate_nan=true` option to the max and min functions, which we would set to false for `softmax` and `log_softmax`.", "We could even determine whether nan checks can be skipped automatically without user input, but it involves a bit of a complicated traversal. We would visit each min or max op or reduction and mark the result as `unchecked` and the input as `propagated`, then move downstream from further uses of the input and from the min/max output, propagating the tags. When a pointwise binary or ternary op other than min or max has an `unchecked` input and a `propagated` input, it resolves the might-be-unchecked flag and becomes properly propagated. If we reach an output or another reduction we stop and if any output is not marked as propagated it means we can't skip nan checks in the original op.", "For the propagation analysis, consider this simple example with no reductions (if we had the non-reduction `maximum`/`minimum` ops that do nan-checks):\r\n```c++\r\nauto tv2 = maximum(tv0, IrBuilder::create<Float>(0.0));\r\nauto tv3 = add(tv0, tv1);\r\nauto tv4 = minimum(tv3, IrBuilder::create<Float>(10.0));\r\nauto tv5 = sub(tv4, tv2);\r\nfusion->addOutput(tv5);\r\n```\r\nCurrently, we would do nan checks when computing both `tv2` and `tv4`, but we could eliminate the check on `tv2` since unpropagated nans would be resolved in `tv5`. The analysis is similar but a little more complicated when there are reductions and broadcasts like in softmax.", "For the immediate task at hand, I believe we can remove one nan check more easily by removing this branch: https://github.com/NVIDIA/Fuser/blob/main/runtime/helpers.cu#L106-L107. If `a == a`, then `a > b` will be false if `b != b` so the else branch subsumes the `b != b` branch. Similarly, for `fmin` we can remove the `a != a` branch. Doing this, we remove one nan check per reduction element, so it should be equivalent in speed to code in the description of this issue, but doesn't necessitate any codegen changes. As mentioned in my other comments, we can probably remove all the nan checks but I will leave that for a separate PR.", "> even if the max were non-nan the resulting softmax still will be nan due to the later sum, so propagation happens automatically. \r\n\r\nWhy? Can you please elaborate?", "Sure. For `log_softmax`, we do something like the following:\r\n```c++\r\nauto a_max = max(a, {1});\r\nauto a_sub = sub(a, broadcast(a_max, {false, true}));\r\nauto a_exp = exp(a_sub);\r\nauto a_lse = log(sum(a_exp, {1}))\r\nauto log_softmax = sub(a_sub, broadcast(a_lse, {false, true}));\r\n```\r\nImagine there is a single nan in some row of `a`. Ordinarily, this would mean `a_max` is nan, which would cascade down so that the whole row of `a_sub` is nan, and ultimately the whole row of `log_softmax` is nan.\r\n\r\nNow imagine we don't check nans for max, so that `a_max` is not nan in that row for which `a` contains a nan. Then `a_sub` contains just that single nan, as does `a_exp`, since `sub` and `exp` propagate nans. But to compute the logsumexp `a_lse`, we sum `a_exp`. That sum propagates nans, so that `a_lse`, and hence `log_softmax` is nan.", "Oh, I see, very interesting. Have never heard of such a data flow analysis for NANs.\r\n\r\nIn terms of actual benefits, the transformation as I showed above may be just enough and easier to implement. I saw it got almost the same performance with `fmaxf`, likely because the root cause of the overhead would be the nan-check branch, which is almost completely eliminated. ", "Interesting. Have you tried it without any nan checking? I am not sure how `fmaxf` works internally but it seems like it would need to branch since it guarantees to return non-nan in case only one input is nan. On the other hand, without nan checks i.e. just `a > b ? a : b` might return nan or not, we don't care!", "Sorry, I meant I compared the performance with just `a > b ? a : b`. ", "With #329, each call to `fmax` will also only have one isnan check, but it comes before `a > b` instead of after. So shouldn't the `#if 0` block now give roughly the same performance as the `#else` code above?", "I actually tried that as well, and it was about the middle of the two cases with about 10% improvement.

      "description" : "Summary from core team meeting discussion:\n\n- The admin has an API that is used for the page explorer in the main menu. It???s built using code from the `wagtail.api.v2 app`, but that app is not required to be installed.\n- Problem: if you hit the endpoints directly in the browser without having the `api.v2` and/or `rest_framework` apps installed, you???ll end up with errors about the templates/static files from DRF not being found. For example:  `/admin/api/main/pages/`\n- Should we update Wagtail???s code so that it does not assume those apps are installed, so people can e.g. remove the Pages menu and completely remove DRF from Wagtail?\n  - Answer: no, we likely don???t want to go down this path because this means we???ll have to take into account of such configurations in different places throughout Wagtail\n  - Alternative solution: make it so that the admin API only uses the `JSONRenderer`. This means the routes will always give JSON even when accessed directly from the browser, allowing us to avoid the template/static files error and avoiding the need for the app to be installed. See https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/renderers/\n\n## Solution\n\nWe need to override `renderer_classes` of the following viewset:\n\nhttps://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/blob/0c3a0b22f0d7dac6d47c1b57a1cc9aefd8f8751e/wagtail/admin/api/views.py#L25\n\nSo that it only uses the `JSONRenderer` if the `rest_framework` app is not installed (and maybe `wagtail.api.v2`? check if this app is really necessary for the API to be used from the browser).\n\nIdeally, we also make it so that the HTMLRenderer is still provided if the necessary apps are installed, so they can still be used in a human-friendly way in the browser for those who install the apps. This can probably be done by turning it into a dynamic `@property` and using `django.apps.apps.is_installed(\"rest_framework\")`. But if this is not possible, then we should only use JSONRenderer.\n\nThen, we need to add tests to ensure that if the necessary apps are not installed, the API response is always in JSON even if the request's `Accept` header prefers HTML, e.g. `text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml`, and perhaps also when the `Accept` header is missing from the request.\n\nHappy to review a PR that does this.\n\n _Originally posted by @laymonage in [#13262](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues/13262#issuecomment-3106739785)_",

The issue persists after adding the user.js, but it is not reproducible in a new, unedited Firefox profile.\n\n### Bug description\n\nHi,\n\nWhen using the just the regular user.js with no modifications tabs are crashing on a lot of sites when selecting all and right clicking again. Tried on a fresh firefox install same issue and profile, no addons etc and a fresh windows reinstall (was doing the latter anyway)\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. visit https://opnsense.org/download/\n2. right click select all\n3. right click again\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/683d8aa9-125d-4d7b-b770-59927558f888\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nnot crash\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Operating System (OS)\n\nWindows (10 or later)\n\n### Browser\n\nFirefox\n\n### Version\n\n138.0.4\n\n### Additional information\n\nintel igpu, latest windows 11",

      "description" : "### Apache Airflow version\n\n3.0.2\n\n### If \"Other Airflow 2 version\" selected, which one?\n\n2.10 and higher\n\n### What happened?\n\nWhen using the new [start_from_trigger ](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow-core/docs/authoring-and-scheduling/deferring.rst) feature introduced in Airflow 2.10 which allows you to run an operator directly within the triggerer without the need to pass via the worker first (which is faster as the scheduler only has to handle the task once instead of twice), it doesn't work when your operator has templated fields.\n\nThis is because the start_trigger_args have to be defined within the class or the constructor, but at that time the possible trigger_kwargs could consist of templated fields, which at that time, aren't rendered yet.\n\n### What you think should happen instead?\n\nTo fix this issue, the [schedule_tis](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow-core/src/airflow/models/dagrun.py#L1929) method of the [DagRun](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow-core/src/airflow/models/dagrun.py) class should render the templated fields of the task first before invoking the [expand_start_from_trigger](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow-core/src/airflow/models/baseoperator.py#L415) method on the [task](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow-core/src/airflow/models/baseoperator.py) (e.g. BaseOperator).\n\nThen the [expand_start_from_trigger](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow-core/src/airflow/models/baseoperator.py#L415) method should be modified to iterate over the templated fields and re-assign those to the trigger_kwargs so that when instantiating the triggerer, it will have the rendered templated fields.\n\n### How to reproduce\n\nImplement the start_from_trigger feature in an operator or sensor which has templated fields.  As there only exist one sensor (e.g. [DateTimeSensorAsync](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/providers/standard/src/airflow/providers/standard/sensors/date_time.py#L108)) using this feature in Airflow, I don't think anyone encountered this issue yet.\n\n### Operating System\n\nRocky Linux\n\n### Versions of Apache Airflow Providers\n\n_No response_\n\n### Deployment\n\nOther 3rd-party Helm chart\n\n### Deployment details\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Are you willing to submit PR?\n\n- [x] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n",

      "comments" : [ "\n\nHi! I had a look at your custom `ManchuZhMT` model.  \nThe `ValueError: You cannot specify both decoder_input_ids and decoder_inputs_embeds at the same time` comes from the fact that your `forward` always passes `decoder_input_ids` to the Marian decoder, while **Trainer + PEFT (LoRA)** may inject a `decoder_inputs_embeds` entry into `**kwargs`. When both reach the decoder, Transformers raises that validation error.\n\n**Minimal fix in your custom model:** drop one of the two before calling `self.decoder` (keeping `decoder_input_ids` is the simplest). For example:\n\n```python\ndef forward(\n    self,\n    input_ids=None,\n    attention_mask=None,\n    decoder_input_ids=None,\n    decoder_attention_mask=None,\n    labels=None,\n    **kwargs,\n):\n    ...\n    # Remove conflicting argument if both are present\n    if \"decoder_inputs_embeds\" in kwargs and decoder_input_ids is not None:\n        kwargs.pop(\"decoder_inputs_embeds\")\n\n    dec_out = self.decoder(\n        input_ids=decoder_input_ids,\n        attention_mask=decoder_attention_mask,\n        encoder_hidden_states=enc_out.last_hidden_state,\n        encoder_attention_mask=extended_mask,\n        return_dict=True,\n        **kwargs,\n    )\n    ...\n````\n\nAfter adding this guard, `trainer.train()` should run normally and produce your LoRA checkpoint.\n\nIf you prefer using embeddings explicitly, you could instead set `decoder_input_ids=None` and keep `decoder_inputs_embeds`.\n\nLet me know if you???d like a small PR adding a defensive check on the library side; happy to help adjust anything if needed. Thanks!\n\n\n", "Opened PR #39566: **Ignore `decoder_inputs_embeds` when `decoder_input_ids` are present**.\n\nIt adds a small guard in `Seq2SeqTrainer.compute_loss` and a test to prevent the `ValueError`.  \nHappy to adjust if you prefer a different location for the fix. Thanks!\n", "@JoseAlvarezMedina \nThanks for your help. I edit my `ManchuZhMT` and add `kwargs = {}` (for debug).\n**However,** The `ValueError` still exists, So I found the code in `file transformers/models/marian/modeling_marian.py, line 992`:\n```Python\n        # retrieve input_ids and inputs_embeds\n        if (input_ids is None) ^ (inputs_embeds is not None):\n            raise ValueError(\"You cannot specify both decoder_input_ids and decoder_inputs_embeds at the same time\")\n        elif input_ids is not None:\n            input = input_ids\n            input_shape = input.shape\n            input_ids = input_ids.view(-1, input_shape[-1])\n        elif inputs_embeds is not None:\n            input_shape = inputs_embeds.size()[:-1]\n            input = inputs_embeds[:, :, -1]\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(\"You have to specify either decoder_input_ids or decoder_inputs_embeds\")\n```\nBy Debugging, I found that both my `decoder_input_ids` and `decoder_inputs_embeds` is `None`, as the screenshot below:\n\n<img width=\"1692\" height=\"1313\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90baacd7-588f-4422-af88-31f46c9ae097\" />\n\nSo maybe the ValueError is caused by the process that `Seq2SeqTrainer`  generate `decoder_input_ids`, or my JSONL Loader(below)?\n```Python\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\n\nmax_len = 256\nbatch_size = 16\n\nraw_ds = load_dataset(\"json\", data_files={\"train\":\"train.jsonl\",\"val\":\"val.jsonl\"})\n\ndef tokenize(batch):\n    model_inputs = manchu_tok(\n        batch[\"source\"],\n        max_length=max_len,\n        truncation=True,\n        padding=\"max_length\"\n    )\n    with chn_tok.as_target_tokenizer():\n        labels = chn_tok(\n            batch[\"target\"],\n            max_length=max_len,\n            truncation=True,\n            padding=\"max_length\"\n        )\n    model_inputs[\"labels\"] = [\n        [(t if t != chn_tok.pad_token_id else -100) for t in label]\n        for label in labels[\"input_ids\"]\n    ]\n    return model_inputs\n\ntokenized_ds = raw_ds.map(tokenize, batched=True)\n```\nIs there any solutions? Thanks\uD83D\uDE23", "Hi, I see this is closed! Has it been resolved?", "@Rocketknight1 emm It haven't been solved yet, and I seemed to close it by mistake.\n\n> Hi, I see this is closed! Has it been resolved?\n\n", "Just took a look - this issue is quite difficult to resolve because it depends on your custom code, and so it's hard for me to figure out if it's a bug in our code or in yours!", "Hi @maintainers! \nI'd like to work on this issue as part of my learning journey.\n\nI'm familiar with model input validation, and I???d appreciate any guidance or confirmation on expected behavior in this case???especially around prioritization when both decoder_input_ids and decoder_inputs_embeds are passed.\n\nHi, @Rocketknight1!\nActually I am building a project to learn about transformers and how use them. In the way I am taking help from ChatGPT.

I don't know that we can simply do better than buffer size in a way that's meaninful to callers. Anything else we do is also approximate.", "I was thinking somethinng like `size_of_val(self)` for an array but agree that it's an overestimate. The caller could also add it themselves since you rightly point out that not all arrays will be serializable", "On second thought I think this is fixable on the user size if we make sure that nbytes contract is the variable length size of the array. The caller has self so adding size_of_val can be done by them", "Fair, then closing!", "should we rename the method / better explain it in the docs? \uD83E\uDD14 ", "Yes, we should!", "will do ", "actually, i feel like for memory management systems it would be better to just be honest about the size. e.g., if you have a million `SequenceArrays`, they start to matter even though they have no buffers.\n\ni don't like the idea of handling this in user space, because you can't just add the top-level size - you have to walk all the children and sum them up, which feels painful\n", "@robert3005 what was the reasoning not to do `size_of_val`? \nAlternatively, we can also manually add all required values in each array - which feels a bit verbose but more correct", "I think you're right. I was looking at our existing implementation and noticed that the change I wanted to make would only ever add the metadata of top level array, however, it makes sense that for nested arrays this could grow a lot. However, we still have a problem of serialized size could not match the in memory size or you could have arrays that can't be serialized. Let me open a pr to see ", "I think it makes sense for nbytes == sum size of all buffers. It's a clean, deterministic number. Maybe the follow up here is to document the method as such.\n\nIf you want a custom measure, for computeing a cache weight or whatever, then I'd say that's something quite specific to the application. Consumer can define their own extension trait, and implement something over depth_first_iterator.\n\nIf you want an exact size, then you're going to have to serialize into byte buffers (which includes _all_ metadata), but obviously that's needlessly expensive for a cache weight.", "I'm not convinced you have to ask all users to reimplement the same thing. There's realistically 3 measures here that anyone might want, the variable size (current nbytes), variable size + in memory size (effectively recursively adding size of self), serialized size. We could have the first 2 but we can implement 2 in spiral for now. 3 is potentially hard since you have to shrink all the buffers to only present values.

For my use case, I would settle for a flag generating errors is a rule hasn't been tested in a run (could be an informational entry in output).\r\n",

This doesn't work, because both algs have a different signature of `def transform`: Scala refuses to export it, and it might not even be possible to implement yourself.\n\nIf we make it an extension method, or have users call `Transformation.of(...)` themselves, we can support this usecase - the only problem is that you can't transform such a combined client, but I doubt users of combined algebras will care.",

So it would seem that maybe the `context` parameter of `_decompose_with_context_` does need to support `None` in these cases.\n\n**However**, those `_decompose_` definitions are unnecessary and should be removed. The `decompose` protocol itself only calls `_decompose_` after it has already tried calling `_decompose_with_context_`, so there's no reason to have a `_decompose_` implementation that just re-calls `_decompose_with_context_`; it's just a redundant call, and could even result in a bug because it causes the provided context to be ignored.\n\nOnce those are removed, then the `None` option can be removed from the corresponding `_decompose_with_context_` implementations.", "One exception to the above comment: removing `GateOperation._decompose_` is problematic because `SingleQubitPauliStringGateOperation` inherits both `GateOperation` and `PauliString`. Currently the `GateOperation._decompose_` hides `PauliString._decompose_`, but if we delete the former, then the latter will get called instead for `SingleQubitPauliStringGateOperation`, which will lead to problems. A couple options:\n\n1. Have `GateOperation._decompose_` return `NotImplemented` explicitly instead of removing it.\n2. Rename `PauliString._decompose_` to `PauliString._decompose_with_context_` so that `GateOperation` still hides it.\n3. Have `PauliString._decompose_` explicitly return `NotImplemented` if it's a `GateOperation`.\n\nAny one or all of them would work." ],

      "description" : "We have a library consistency check for checking whether fields in a set of entries are set/unset consistently. Currently, this is NOT aware of the difference of BibTeX and BibLaTeX.\n\n??? This is a good excercise to learn test-driven development and using a data model. This issue cannot be solved with an AI. You really have to think though BibTeX and BibLaTeX for yourself! Take this issue only if you are willing to invest significant time. ???\n\nExample: \n\n```bibtex\n@online{withDate,\n  date = {2025},\n  urldate = {2025-07-05}\n}\n\n@online{withoutDate,\n  urldate = {2025-07-05}\n}\n```\n\nIn BibTeX: Only `withDate`, field: `date` should be reported, because both entries take `urldate`.\n\nIn BibLaTeX: Only `withoutDate`, field: `date` (missing) should be reported, because required field `date` is missing.\n\n## Task\n\n- Modify `org.jabref.logic.quality.consistency.BibliographyConsistencyCheck` to use a complete `BibDatabaseContext` instead of a list of entries\n- Modify `org.jabref.logic.quality.consistency.BibliographyConsistencyCheck#check` to adhere the mode\n\n## Hints\n\n- Required fields of BibLaTeX `@online`: `org.jabref.model.entry.types.BiblatexEntryTypeDefinitions#ONLINE`\n- Get used to `org.jabref.model.entry.types.BibtexEntryTypeDefinitions` and `org.jabref.model.entry.types.BiblatexEntryTypeDefinitions`\n- One can get the required fields using `org.jabref.model.entry.BibEntryType#getRequiredFields`\n- Do test-driven development. Start with enabling `org.jabref.logic.quality.consistency.BibliographyConsistencyCheckTest#unsetFieldsReported` again.\n- Do not get confused with \"library\" and \"database\". User-facing we talk about \"library\", inside the code, we use \"database\", but mean \"library\".\n",

Preferably from the main deployment link.\n* Add a section showcasing all the respected contributors.\n* Ensure the **tech stack** is accurate and complete\n* Improve **formatting, styling, or sectioning** to make it more interactive and polished\n* Add or improve **badges, headings, emojis, spacing, or links** where needed\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDE4B Why You Would Want to Work on This:\n\n- Every valid PR will be considered for scoring under GSSoC???25.\n- Multiple contributors can take up this task in rounds (for different versions). It is a scoring Issue, if you stay updated.\n- Comment below and **wait for assignment** before raising a PR.\n\n---\n",

      "description" : "A couple of unit test files uses unittest's `TestCase` classes: besides the class being an extra namespace, and being implemented in different way tan the rest of codebase, there is an actual functionality issue with the setup/teardown methods since they cannot use pytest fixtures as easily as pytest fixtures:\n\n```python\nclass Foo(TestCase):\n    # Ends up with:\n    # E       TypeError: Foo.setUp() missing 1 required positional argument: 'tmppath'\n    def setUp(self, tmppath):\n```\n\nPytest can work with them, but the missing native support for fixtures creates a rift between these tests and the rest - a clear example is the \"create a temporary directory\" task: pytest offers the `tmpdir` fixture, which we wrap with a `tmppath` fixture to produce `Path` instances. Including `tmppath` or `tmppath_factory` as a parameter will not work. This opens the door to duplication of code, implementations in other files (`tempfile` can be found in 5 files under `tests/unit/`...), and different ways in which setup/teardown needs to be reasoned about in general, which I think is a bad idea.\n\nSo, I'd like to get rid of test classes. Current `tests/unit/test_id.py`:\n\n```python\nclass IdEmpty(TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        self.path = Path(tempfile.mkdtemp()) / \"empty\"\n        shutil.copytree(test_path / \"empty\", self.path)\n        self.original_directory = Path.cwd()\n        os.chdir(self.path)\n        self.base_tree = fmf.Tree(self.path)\n\n    def tearDown(self):\n        os.chdir(self.original_directory)\n        shutil.rmtree(self.path)\n\n    def test_base(self):\n        node = self.base_tree.find(\"/some/structure\")\n        test = tmt.Test(logger=root_logger, node=node)\n        assert test.id is None\n```\n\nPytest tends toward something like this:\n\n```python\n@pytest.fixture(name='empty_tree')\ndef fixture_empty_tree(tmppath: Path) -> fmf.Tree:\n    path = tmppath / \"empty\"\n    shutil.copytree(test_path / \"empty\", path)\n\n    original_directory = Path.cwd()\n    os.chdir(path)\n\n    try:\n        yield fmf.Tree(path)\n\n    finally:\n        os.chdir(original_directory)\n        shutil.rmtree(path)\n\n\ndef test_base(empty_tree: fmf.Tree):\n    node = empty_tree.find(\"/some/structure\")\n    test = tmt.Test(logger=root_logger, node=node)\n    assert test.id is None\n```",

We could consider first implementing one factory for record value implementations, and later wrapping that to provide some kind of recyclable functionality.\n\n### Motivation\n\nThese tend to be duplicated, creating noise at review time, but also running the risk of forgetting to map them in every place.\n\n### Acceptance criteria\n\n- [ ] There is a new utility which exposes a single method `<T extends RecordValue> createFromValueType(ValueType)`, and returns the appropriate record value implementation from the enum.\n- [ ] This utility is used in the two places mentioned above, and any other where it makes sense.\n\n\n### Links\n\n_No response_\n\n### Breakdown\n\n_No response_",

At the highest level, they can simply be input and output. As LLMs grow more sophisticated, additional usage types are necessary, such as cached_tokens, audio_tokens, and image_tokens.\n> \n> In the UI, Langfuse summarizes all usage types that include the string input as input usage types, and similarly those including output as output usage types. If no total usage type is ingested, Langfuse sums up all usage type units to compute the total.\n\nHowever, in PydanticAI, cached_tokens are currently logged as gen_ai.usage.details.cached_tokens. This causes Langfuse to treat them as an ???other??? usage type, rather than aggregating them properly. As a result, the total usage and cost calculations may be incorrect in Langfuse.\n\n<img width=\"263\" height=\"318\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c2c3fa0-f6b2-47b7-a9c5-497d80a78a18\" />\n\nYou can see from the image that cached_tokens is calculated as part of total usage rather than being grouped under input.\n\nI believe this behavior should be adjusted in PydanticAI???perhaps conditionally???when Langfuse is used as the tracing backend (instead of Logfire), to ensure compatibility.\n\n### Example Code\n\n```Python\n\n```\n\n### Python, Pydantic AI & LLM client version\n\n```Text\npython: 3.13\n\n\"logfire[httpx]>=3.17.0\n\"pydantic-ai-slim[mcp,openai]>=0.3.5\",\n\"pydantic-ai[logfire]>=0.3.5\",\n```",

This shows how the tests are expected to look like. Use the same wording for naming the tests.\n\nTake care that there are different property types:\n- Simple (strings etc.)\n- Boolean: The default is `null` (unset). The value Boolean.TRUE has to be tested usually, sometimes even Boolean.FALSE.\n- Collections. They could be null or empty.\n\nIf possible, verify with Coverage (e.g. in IntelliJ) that all if-branches of the tested method have  been covered.\n\n**Additional Context**\n\nAdding these tests is necessary before performing refactorings to the tested methods. Some implementations are larger, and Sonar moans about too high cognitive complexity ([example](https://sonarcloud.io/project/issues?impactSoftwareQualities=MAINTAINABILITY&rules=java%3AS3776&issueStatuses=OPEN%2CCONFIRMED&id=operaton_operaton&open=AZLaQugF8ZwKcH34-X-G)).\n\n<!-- \nPlease provide a clear and concise description of the task.\n\nThe task should be simple enough for a new contributor to understand and complete.\nGive examples, provide links and whatever helps to understand the task.\n-->\n\n**Contribution**\n\nIf you want to work on this task, just state it in a comment.

When you forgot, the issue doesn't immediately manifest. But rather you have to investigate why a certain feature flag is only returning the default variant. You may have imported both packages but forgot to call `AddHostedFeatureLifecycle()` on the OpenFeatureBuilder.\n\n`AddHostedFeatureLifecycle()` does _feel_ like it should implicitly happen when you make a call to `builder.Services.AddOpenFeature()`.\n\nI'd like to understand the rationale behind the decision of having two seperate packages and an additional mandatory (not obvious) builder extension method.", "Hey @kylejuliandev, there was quite a bit of discussion around this when we first added DI. Here's the [original PR](https://github.com/open-feature/dotnet-sdk/pull/310). If I remember correctly, we wanted to keep it in a separate package until we were happy with the behavior. Now that it has been live for a while, we could consider including it in the SDK and dropping the experimental label.\n\nFYI @toddbaert @arttonoyan", "@kylejuliandev Thanks for the thoughtful feedback - it's a great observation.\n\nThe reason we keep `AddHostedFeatureLifecycle()` in a separate package is to support flexibility across different application types. The `Hosted` and `DependencyInjection` packages serve distinct purposes. While `AddOpenFeature()` is designed for registering core services, not every application requires hosted infrastructure. For instance, desktop apps like Windows Forms or WPF, or lightweight console apps, may use DI but don't need lifecycle management via `IHostedService`.\n\nThis separation also aligns with Microsoft???s own approach ??? where hosting, diagnostics, and core service registration are provided via separate packages ??? giving developers fine-grained control over dependencies and application structure.\n\nThat said, I completely agree the current developer experience could be more intuitive. It's easy to forget `AddHostedFeatureLifecycle()`, and the resulting fallback to the default variant is hard to trace.\n\n**Maybe we can provide a new extension method in the Hosted package**, something like `.AddOpenFeatureServer()` (or another appropriate name), which would internally call `AddOpenFeature()`, `AddHostedFeatureLifecycle()`, and register any other host-specific services. This could offer a smoother setup experience for server-based apps without sacrificing modularity.\ncc: @beeme1mr @toddbaert  @askpt \n", "@arttonoyan and @kylejuliandev, I was playing around with Copilot to generate some documentation for issue #471. I think it was a great suggestion in relation to the `AddHostedLifecycle` issue we have.\n\nWhat are your thoughts about using\n```csharp\nusing Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;\nusing OpenFeature.Hosting;\n\nvar host = Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)\n    .ConfigureOpenFeature(builder =>\n    {\n        builder.AddProvider(new MyFeatureFlagProvider());\n    })\n    .Build();\n\nawait host.RunAsync();\n```\n\nI know the file is completely wrong, but I liked the suggestions. See it here: https://github.com/open-feature/dotnet-sdk/blob/bbc77bfed182d35d027aff68fc1419f74b05e0e9/src/OpenFeature.Hosting/README.md", "> I wonder if we should kill Hosting and move this logic to the DependencyInjection library.\n\nThink combine them into one library could help reduce the integration complexity.\n\nOpenTelemetry is adopting the `OpenTelemetry.Extensions.Hosting` which has a dependency for `Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.Abstractions`", "@askpt and @kylejuliandev I've been reflecting on this topic and exploring how other frameworks handle similar scenarios. Previously, I advocated for maintaining two separate packages: `OpenFeature.DependencyInjection` and `OpenFeature.Hosting`, to provide flexibility and modularity. However, upon further consideration and observing industry trends, I believe it's worth reevaluating this approach.\n\nA notable example is the MassTransit framework. Starting with version 8, MassTransit deprecated the `AddMassTransitHostedService()` method. Previously, developers had to explicitly register the hosted service to manage the bus lifecycle, which often led to misconfigurations when this step was overlooked. To address this, MassTransit integrated the hosted service registration directly into the `AddMassTransit()` method, streamlining the configuration process and reducing potential errors.&#x20;\n\nGiven that most applications utilizing OpenFeature will require hosting capabilities, adopting a similar approach could enhance the developer experience and simplify setup. I support the idea of integrating hosting configuration into the main package. Additionally, providing an option to customize hosting behavior, akin to MassTransit's use of `MassTransitHostOptions`, would offer flexibility for advanced scenarios.\n\n**Here are some relevant references for further context:**\n\n* [MassTransit GitHub Discussion #3051](https://github.com/MassTransit/MassTransit/discussions/3051)\n* [MassTransit Upgrade Guide ??? `AddMassTransitHostedService` Deprecated](https://masstransit.io/support/upgrade#addmasstransithostedservice-deprecated)", "> @askpt and @kylejuliandev I've been reflecting on this topic and exploring how other frameworks handle similar scenarios.

Let's also make sure the `AddHosting` is no longer required. The migration plan is:\n- [ ] Add Deprecation annotation to the AddHosting and add note to the README\n- [ ] Move the code to the DI package and do the hosting registration behind the scenes\n- [ ] Show deprecation notice on Nuget package\n- [ ] Remove old code but keeping a readme at the root of the hosting project with instructions on the migration \n\nAt the end, we should be able to only declare the DI package and have everything registered correctly.\n@kylejuliandev if you are okay with it, can we change the title and description of this issue?", "Sounds good to me \uD83D\uDC4D @askpt " ],

The stratify transformer's code naively reverses the circuit by reversing moments, but does not reverse the operations within moments, which does matter because multiple interactions with the same measurement key are allowed in a single moment, and they will be sequenced in the order that they're added to the moment. https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/a89f5b9f0875dcae419efc13790af078075fcb6b/cirq-core/cirq/transformers/stratify.py#L83-L90.\n\n#6899 fixed this for the `align_right` transformer, reversing the operations within each moment when it reversed the circuit. So the same fix should be applied here. It's probably worth creating a `Circuit.reverse()` method to avoid copy-paste, and to reduce the likelihood of this happening in the future.\n\nThe example attached to the issue produces a huge circuit after transforming. Here's a much simpler one. \n\n```python\n    q0, q1 = cirq.LineQubit.range(2)\n    circuit =  cirq.Circuit([\n        cirq.measure(q0, key='c'),\n        cirq.X(q1).with_classical_controls(\"c\"),\n        cirq.X(q0).with_classical_controls(\"c\"),\n        cirq.X(q1),\n    )\n    print(repr(circuit))\n    circuit = stratified_circuit(circuit)\n    print(repr(circuit))\n\n    simulator = cirq.Simulator()\n    simulator.run(circuit)\n```\n\nNote this bug has nothing to do with subcircuits.\n", "Hi, if no one else is currently working on this issue I'd like to pick it up.", "After creating a Circuit.reverse() method, would it be in scope for this issue to search for naive reversing of circuits and replace those with the new Circuit.reverse() method? Or would it be better to open a new issue for that refactoring?", "Probably the latter ", "> Hi, if no one else is currently working on this issue I'd like to pick it up.\n\nAssigned.  Thank you for taking this on!", "The tests for the stratify transformer seem to use the naive reversal as the basis of their \"correct\". Should these tests be modified to reflect the new reversal method? I'm not 100% confident in my understanding of the stratify transformer, input as to whether the tests are correctly failing or need to be modified would be helpful.", "Yeah, the tests should be fixed too in that case.\n\nStratify in general just makes sure that incompatible gate types don't live on the same moment.

Initially, verify the email address, which should proceed smoothly. \r\n- Next, attempt to verify the phone number, Despite the successful verification of the email address, the system incorrectly indicates that the user is unverified when verifying the phone number. \r\n- In an attempt to rectify this inconsistency, proceed to unverify the phone number. Unexpectedly, the system now displays an alert indicating that the user is verified, contradicting the initial indication of being unverified.\n\n### \uD83D\uDC4D Expected behavior\n\n- When the user hits **Verify Phone**, the alert should confirm that the `user is verified`.\r\n- When the user hits **Unverify Phone**, the alert should confirm that the `user is unverified`.\n\n### \uD83D\uDC4E Actual Behavior\n\nWhen attempting to **verify the phone numbe**r, an alert incorrectly states that the `user is unverified`. \r\nHowever, when attempting to **unverify the phone**, the system incorrectly indicates that the `user is verified.`\n\n### \uD83C\uDFB2 Appwrite version\n\nVersion 1.4.x\n\n### \uD83D\uDCBB Operating system\n\nWindows\n\n### \uD83E\uDDF1 Your Environment\n\n_No response_\n\n### \uD83D\uDC40 Have you spent some time to check if this issue has been raised before?\n\n- [X] I checked and didn't find similar issue\n\n### \uD83C\uDFE2 Have you read the Code of Conduct?\n\n- [X] I have read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/appwrite/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)",

We then found the condition that was causing the flaw [here](https://github.com/appwrite/console/blob/main/src/routes/(console)/project-%5Bregion%5D-%5Bproject%5D/auth/user-%5Buser%5D/updateStatus.svelte#L49)\n\nWhich was missing a bang.\n\n[stnguyen90](https://github.com/stnguyen90) mentioned the desired behavior:\n\tXYZ's email has been verified\n\tXYZ's email has been unverified\n\tXYZ's phone has been verified\n\tXYZ's phone has been unverified\nNote:\n  The \"s\" should only be there if the name does not end with s. For example, if the user's name was \"Charles\", it should be \"Charles' email has been verified\"\n\nWe implemented a solution that met these requirements by changing this [code](https://github.com/appwrite/console/blob/main/src/routes/(console)/project-%5Bregion%5D-%5Bproject%5D/auth/user-%5Buser%5D/updateStatus.svelte#L48-L50)\n\nTo this code:\n`message: ${$user.name || $user.email || $user.phone || 'The account'}${( $user.name || $user.email || $user.phone || 'The account' ).endsWith('s') ? \"'\" : \"'s\"} email has been ${!$user.emailVerification ? 'unverified' : 'verified'},`\n\nOur team then implemented the same solution to updateVerificationEmail() as well, as seen [here](https://github.com/appwrite/console/pull/2112/files)\n\nThis solution can be tested just as [gurjeetsinghvir](https://github.com/gurjeetsinghvirdee) shows in the video posted to this issue.  Under a project, select Auth. In Auth, select or create a user that has both an email and a phone number. Select the 'Verify account' option and then verify the phone number and email. The correct alerts will be displayed.\n\nHere is out PR: [fix-1392](https://github.com/appwrite/console/pull/2112)\n\nDid we approach this issue correctly?

There are 2 primary types of lists\n1. those managed by individuals (we've had this since 2011 or so)\n2. community lists (which anyone can help edit\n\nIn the context of [1], our Book Pages were recently updated so that the Lists section show beautiful List cards for any **person's** Lists which include this book. These List cards allow other patrons to **follow** the creator of this list.\n\nHowever, in case [2] which is much newer to the system, there is no one to follow in the context of community lists.\n\nTherefore, anywhere we include List cards, we should first include a check to see if there is an `owner` of the list and if there **isn't**, then don't render the bottom of that card (i.e. the owner / follow section). Instead, perhaps note it's a community list\n\n@cdrini notes this templates may already be include some of the logic we want:\nhttps://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/blob/e6c2f333710633566709de28cac4bb87d8ad1ce7/openlibrary/templates/lists/list_follow.html#L8\n\n" ],

Why should some language have a separate language and some exist only as collective code? Why should OL continue low-quality practices if we have the opportunity to do better? I remember this issue being raised in the past for some other languages. With the same success we can just put all the Slavic languages as, well, Slavic rather than each of them having separate code.\n\nNote: This is similar to https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/issues/6709 and will likely be closed the same way, but still making the issue to document it.\n\n### Reproducing the bug\n\n1.

Try to add ???Tulu??? as one of the language codes\n\n* Expected behavior: ???Tulu??? being available\n* Actual behavior: ???Tulu??? is not available\n\n### Context\n\n- Browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, etc): Firefox\n- OS (Windows, Mac, etc): Linux\n- Logged in (Y/N): Y\n- Environment (prod, dev, local): prod\n\n\n### Breakdown\n\n<!-- Overview of the proposed solution / implementation? -->\n\n#### Requirements Checklist\n* [ ]\n\n#### Related files\n<!-- Files related to this issue; this is super useful for new contributors who might want to help!

Xformers is not available on all architectures and most other vision encoders have multiple backends for attention. Pixtral is maybe the only that uses xformers strictly.\n\nWe should be able to replace the `xops` usage in the `pixtral.py` classes `VisionTransformer` and `Attention` by following the same substitution as in the HF modules.\nSuch as \nhttps://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/a0f8a7964694a6077689b242b5eca95de392d4bb/vllm/model_executor/models/pixtral.py#L1274-L1282\nand\nhttps://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/a0f8a7964694a6077689b242b5eca95de392d4bb/vllm/model_executor/models/pixtral.py#L1087-L1099\n\n\n### Alternatives\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Before submitting a new issue...\n\n- [x] Make sure you already searched for relevant issues, and asked the chatbot living at the bottom right corner of the [documentation page](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/), which can answer lots of frequently asked questions.",

I had a question and would appreciate your input on this.\n\nYou mentioned wanting a UI filter to show only DAGs with import errors (`has_import_errors = true`). That makes sense, and I actually opened [this issue](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/53536) to implement the change on the API side as well.\n\nHowever, after digging into it, I realized there???s a complication: even though the `Dags` table has a `has_import_errors` field (which is `false` when there are no errors), if a DAG *does* have an import error, it never gets an entry in the `Dags` table at all. I tested this by creating a DAG with an import error:\n\n```python\nfrom airflow import DAG\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n# This will break the import!\nthis_will_throw_an_error\n\ndefault_args = {\n    'start_date': datetime(2023, 1, 1),\n}\n\ndag = DAG(\n    'broken_dag',\n    default_args=default_args,\n    schedule_interval=None,\n)\n```\n\nAs expected, the database only has my older (valid) DAG, but not the new one with the import error. \n\n<img width=\"900\" height=\"191\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f11d5c7-a8ae-4f09-9885-ce1ec59d9aa5\" />\n\nThe broken DAG does show up in the Airflow UI (in the \"Import Errors\" section), but there???s no entry for it in the Dags table in the DB. \n\n<img width=\"124\" height=\"83\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2115d883-d3d7-4d02-8951-129f3cc6b683\" />\n\n<img width=\"848\" height=\"208\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd59ed07-692d-40a5-b515-97c75ddf0499\" />\n\n<img width=\"946\" height=\"421\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bafd60c2-79f3-47e8-a431-ec44dc97ec80\" />\n\nThis seems to be because there???s a separate `import_error` table handling these cases. I???ve also confirmed this with @rawwar .\n\n<img width=\"858\" height=\"539\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0ba340a-f848-49bd-9f2a-a27a00dccf8f\" />\n\nGiven this setup, it seems like adding an API/UI filter on `has_import_errors` wouldn???t actually be useful, since the broken DAGs aren???t in the `Dags` table to be filtered in the first place, they???re already shown separately in the UI.\n\nCould you please advise whether we should still go ahead with this filter, or if it makes more sense to close the issue I opened yesterday as \"not planned\"? I can start looking into other filters in the meantime. Would appreciate a quick response, thanks!\n", "Yes maybe just disregard that field for now and focus on other filters.\n\nIt???s weird I wasn???t able to identify where that Dag attribute was set. I???ll need to do more digging. ", "Thanks @AryanK1511 - sorry for the delay. Agree that that's weird. If you come across more that don't work or can't get to any, just comment on the issue and move on. All and any progress is helpful, happy to create other issues if we need to for tracking purposes.\n\nThanks again for taking this on! " ],

We cannot yet delete these components until 2026.\n\n### Proposal\n\nModify Kafka storage and ingester code to use Kafka exporter/receiver from OTEL Contrib. We're already using those in Jaeger v2, and in Jaeger v1 there are precedents on using OTEL components (e.g. OTLP receiver, Zipkin receiver, etc.)\n\nThe existing Kafka integration tests will be useful to validate the functionality.",

      "repositoryName" : "maximhq/bifrost",
      "description" : "## Issue Description\n\nThe regex pattern for validating connection strings in the MCP client form component has incorrect anchoring that allows invalid URLs to pass validation.\n\n## Location\nFile: `ui/components/config/mcp-client-form.tsx`\nLines: 107-111\n\n## Problem\nThe current regex pattern `/^(http:\\/\\/|https:\\/\\/|env\\.[A-Z_]+$)/` only anchors the third alternative (`env\\.[A-Z_]+$`). The first two alternatives (`http:\\/\\/` and `https:\\/\\/`) are not properly anchored, allowing trailing characters to be accepted.\n\nThis means URLs like `http://garbage` or `https://anythingelse` would incorrectly pass validation.\n\n## Current Code\n```typescript\nValidator.pattern(\n  form.connection_string || '',\n  /^(http:\\/\\/|https:\\/\\/|env\\.[A-Z_]+$)/,\n  'Connection URL must start with http://, https://, or be an environment variable (env.VAR_NAME)',\n),\n```\n\n## Suggested Fix\n```typescript\nValidator.pattern(\n  form.connection_string || '',\n  /^(?:http:\\/\\/|https:\\/\\/|env\\.[A-Z_]+)$/,\n  'Connection URL must start with http://, https://, or be an environment variable (env.VAR_NAME)',\n),\n```\n\n## Changes Made\n1. Convert capturing group to non-capturing group: `(?:...)`\n2. Move the end-of-string anchor `$` outside the group to apply to all alternatives\n\n## References\n- Original PR: https://github.com/maximhq/bifrost/pull/162\n- Comment: https://github.com/maximhq/bifrost/pull/162#discussion_r2209185304\n\n## Impact\nThis is a validation bug that could allow malformed URLs to be accepted during MCP client configuration.",

Better API consistency with OpenAI and other providers\n2. More intuitive for users familiar with these APIs\n3. Reduces unnecessary nesting\n4.

This is similar to how the [Spark Thrift Server](https://www.russellspitzer.com/2017/05/19/Spark-Sql-Thriftserver/) allows connection via `jdbc:hive2://`.\n\n(As far as I can tell, the Spark Thrift Server uses the JDBC protocol, and do not use Apache Thrift.)\n\nBallista used to support Arrow Flight SQL (~1,000 LoC) but the functionality has been removed (<https://github.com/apache/datafusion-ballista/pull/1228>).

Here are a few pointers that you may look at.\n\n* **gRPC server code generation**.

You can refer to the `create_session_context` implementation in the `sail-spark-connect` crate. (In the future we can extract related functions to another crate since they will be used for both the Spark Connect server and the Arrow Flight SQL server.)\n* **Query execution**. You can see how `resolve_and_execute_plan` is used in the `sail-spark-connect` crate.\n* **Overall architecture**. The Ballista implementation (removed in <https://github.com/apache/datafusion-ballista/pull/1228> but is still useful for us) is a relevant example for how the server would look like in Sail.", "Awesome, yea I saw ballista briefly and will look more into their implementation.  I also saw I pushed the Protos but I'll keep that clean.  I'm essentially at the pause point of connecting to sail so I appreciate your help with the entry fn.  If this looks good then I'll try to have an iteration up this week.", "Sounds good! Feel free to continue the implementation and I'd be happy to answer any questions you may have!", "Hey @linhr I have an update and a test for the jdbc connector [sail-flight](https://github.com/DeliveranceTechSolutions/sail-flight)", "Nice progress!\n\nI skimmed through the code and it seems it currently uses DataFusion `SessionContext` and `.sql()` method for query execution. I guess a next step to consider could be switching to Sail's query execution methods.\n\nLet me also think about how to refactor the session constructor so that you don't have to depend on the `sail-spark-connect` crate.", "Will the SessionContext still be stemming from DataFusion or is there something I'm not seeing?\n\nDo I need to instantiate the SqlCommand proto struct if that is the case?", "The Sail `SessionContext` is still DataFusion session context but we have special construction logic. The \"**Session management**\" note in my earlier comment has pointers to related code.\n\n`SqlCommand` is part of the Spark Connect protocol and is unrelated to the Arrow Flight server.\n\nYou can (1) call `parse_one_statement` to parse the SQL string, (2) call `from_ast_statement` to convert SQL AST to the Sail spec, and (3) call `resolve_and_execute_plan` to execute the plan using the session context. You can search for usage of these functions to get an idea how they are used in practice.", "Oh apologies, I think I understand what needs to be done now.

      "description" : "### Use case\n\nCurrently, opacity is at `layers[{layerId}].parameters.opacity`. `layers[{layerId}].parameters.*` contains fields that are specific to the layer type, specified in `packages/schema/src/schema/project/layers`. Every schema in that directory contains a `opacity` property. `layers[{layerId}].*` contains fields that are generic to all layers, like `visible`. Those are defined in `packages/schema/src/schema/project/jgis.json`.\n\n### Preferred solution\n\nI think `opacity` is the exact same type of property as `visible` -- it's generic to all layers, and their actual functions are in the same category. I think they should be siblings, `layer[{layerId}].opacity`, `layer[{layerId}].visible`. They would both be defined only once in `packages/schema/src/schema/project/jgis.json`.\n\n### Alternative solutions\n\n_No response_",

      "description" : "**Why should this code be refactored?**\n\nThe current use of the `setUp` method runs before every test, causing unnecessary repeated database setup and slowing down test execution. Replacing it with a class-level `setUpTestData` can significantly improve test performance by setting up test data once per test class.\n\n**Scope of Refactoring**\n\nRefactor test classes that currently use `setUp` to initialize test data and replace it with:\n```\n@classmethod\ndef setUpTestData(cls)\n```\n\n**Expected Benefits**\n\nFaster test suite execution due to reduced redundant database operations, improved maintainability by centralizing test data setup\n\n**Potential Risks or Challenges**\n\nSome tests might unintentionally modify shared test data, causing inter-test dependencies. Careful review and test isolation checks will be necessary after refactoring.\n\n**Additional Notes**\n\nRefer to Django???s documentation on [setUpTestData](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/topics/testing/tools/#django.test.TestCase.setUpTestData) for best practices. Consider running the full test suite to ensure no side effects occur.\n",

So, for labels and annotations validations, we need to implement those by webhooks as opposed to CRD markers.\n\n### Why is this needed?\n\nAs we designed Trainer v2 in https://github.com/kubeflow/trainer/tree/master/docs/proposals/2170-kubeflow-trainer-v2#the-training-runtime-api\n\n> The TrainingRuntime is immutable, and so to make a change, a new version of the TrainingRuntime must be created and then the user must change the TrainJob to point to the new version. This provides control as to how changes to runtimes propagate to existing training jobs. For example, when training is running for a long time (e.g. 1-2 months).\n\nIn the first iteration, we do not have any kind of version control mechanism. So, to avoid TrainJob disruption by changing TrainingRuntime, we should handle TrainingRuntime and ClusterTrainingRuntime as immutable objects.\n\n### Love this feature?\n\nGive it a \uD83D\uDC4D We prioritize the features with most \uD83D\uDC4D",

Right now, our [Extraction Rules](https://github.com/elastic/crawler/blob/main/docs/features/EXTRACTION_RULES.md) only allow you to get the text content of fields by a selector, but not arbitrary attributes of arbitrary elements.\n\nWe may add this capability one day. But in the mean time, I'd suggest using the full-html extraction feature:\n\nhttps://github.com/elastic/crawler/blob/8b63c7b56ac60fbda35be5b75d6a6b155a36c577/config/crawler.yml.example#L82-L84\n\ncoupled with an ingest pipeline that can find the image tag you care about, and extract the URL that way. Here's an example from a personal project of mine:\n\nhttps://github.com/seanstory/nethys-search-ui/blob/671b0649852d90322759b18c24e79c4a9fedc0ac/script/fixtures/pipeline.json#L72-L90" ],

Another advantage is that they can then be easily used outside github actions if desired.

      "description" : "### Is your feature request related to a problem?\n\n- [x] Yes, it is related to a problem\n\n### Describe the feature you'd like\n\n### \uD83C\uDF1F Feature Description\n\nThis feature focuses on a critical enhancement of the initial **Classification Prompt**. The goal is to refine the prompt's logic to be much stricter and more precise, ensuring that the DevRel agent is only triggered for queries that are explicitly its responsibility. This involves improving the instructions the LLM uses to decide whether a message requires agent intervention.\n\nAdditionally, this task includes a secondary objective to review all other existing prompts (`agent_prompt`, `summarization_prompt`, etc.) for clarity, efficiency, and alignment with the latest system architecture.\n\n### \uD83D\uDD0D Problem Statement\n\nCurrently, the classification prompt may be too broad, leading to the DevRel agent responding to general conversations or messages where it's not needed. This can create several issues:\n\n1.  **Unnecessary Invocations**: The agent wastes resources processing irrelevant messages.\n2.  **User Annoyance**: An AI assistant that injects itself into every conversation can be perceived as intrusive or unhelpful.\n3.  **Lack of Precision**: The agent may misinterpret context and provide answers when it should remain silent, degrading the quality of the user experience.\n\nThe core problem is a lack of **strict activation boundaries** for the agent.\n\n### \uD83C\uDFAF Expected Outcome\n\n1.  **Modified Classification Prompt**: The `Classification Prompt` will be rewritten to include new, strict rules. The agent should **only** be activated if one of the following conditions is met:\n      * The user **explicitly tags or mentions** the DevRel AI bot (e.g., `@Devr.AI, can you help?`).\n      * The user's query is a direct question about the project, community, contribution process, or a technical issue clearly related to the repository (e.g., \"How do I set up the development environment?\", \"I'm getting a build error.\").\n      * The prompt will explicitly instruct the model to **ignore** general chatter, greetings, and conversations between other users unless the bot is tagged.\n2.  **Reduced False Positives**: After implementation, there should be a measurable decrease in the number of times the agent responds to irrelevant conversations.\n3.  **Improved Prompt Suite**: A brief review of all other system prompts will be conducted, with minor enhancements made for clarity and conciseness.\n\n### Record\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\n- [ ] I want to work on implementing this feature",

      "description" : "Currently, the unittests in the `vmm` package have to be run sequentially due to reliance on global state in some virtio device tests. More specifically, various tests in the `vsock` and `rng` modules use a global `METRICS` object (see also https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/issues/2899). This design using a global METRICS object is fine for production, because a VMM can have at most one vsock and rng device each, however multiple unit tests running in parallel can create multiple device objects, which then simultaneously update the global metrics. Since our tests contain assertions on the value of the metrics to validate functionality, this causes spurious failures. \r\n\r\nWe can fix this by moving the vsock and rng device to a \"per device metrics\" model, as already adopted by net and block devices (see for example https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4145). \r\n\r\nAs part of this issue, 3 things will need to be done\r\n- [ ] Update the vsock device to use a \"per device metrics\" model\r\n- [ ] Update the rng device to use a \"per device metrics\" model\r\n- [ ] Fix the `test_tap_name` test to no longer use a hardcoded value of `tap0` (if multiple tests run in parallel and create tap devices, it is no longer guaranteed that the tap device created in this test will be called \"tap0\", it could be \"tap1\" or \"tap43\". Thus we probably just want some sort of regex match on the tap device name).\r\n\r\nThese can all be addressed in individual PRs, or all in one, depending on how much of a task you want to tackle :) ",

      "url" : "https://github.com/AOSSIE-Org/Devr.AI/issues/97",
      "repositoryName" : "AOSSIE-Org/Devr.AI",
      "description" : "### Is your feature request related to a problem?\n\n- [x] Yes, it is related to a problem\n\n### Describe the feature you'd like\n\n## \uD83C\uDF1F Feature Description\n\nThis feature re-envisions the **`FAQ Handler`** as a specialized tool that leverages web search to answer general, high-level questions about the organization. It is designed to be the go-to tool for users seeking to understand the organization's mission, projects, and operational model.\n\nIt will be triggered when users ask questions like:\n\n  * *\"What is this organization all about?\"*\n  * *\"How does this organization work?\"*\n  * *\"What projects do you have?\"*\n  * *\"What are the main goals of Devr.AI?\"*\n\n## \uD83D\uDD0D Problem Statement\n\nNewcomers and potential contributors often have foundational questions about the organization itself before they dive into specific projects. Answering these questions manually is repetitive and inefficient. While a static knowledge base could work, it risks becoming outdated. A dynamic approach is needed to provide accurate, current information based on the organization's official public presence.\n\n## \uD83C\uDFAF Expected Outcome\n\nThe `FAQ Handler` will act as an automated public-facing representative, providing instant and accurate information about the organization. The expected outcome is a system that can:\n\n  * **Receive a general query** about the organization.\n  * **Dynamically search the web**, focusing on the organization's official website, blog, and public repositories.\n  * **Synthesize the search results** into a concise, easy-to-understand answer.\n  * **Provide source links** to allow users to explore the topic further.\n\n## \uD83D\uDCF7 Screenshots and Design Ideas\n\nThe workflow will be managed by the `FAQ Handler` tool, which will essentially be a specialized and intelligent implementation of a web search node.\n\n1.  **Trigger**: A user asks a general question.\n      * *User*: \"What kind of projects does this organization work on?\"\n2.  **Input**: The user's query is passed to the `FAQ Handler`.\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"query\": \"What projects does this organization have?\"\n    }\n    ```\n3.  **Action - Intelligent Web Search**:\n      * The tool formulates targeted search queries. For the example above, it would generate queries like:\n          * `\"Devr.AI open source projects\"`\n          * `\"Devr.AI GitHub repositories\"`\n          * `\"About Devr.AI projects\"`\n      * It executes these queries using the **Web Search Tool**.\n4.  **Synthesis**:\n      * The tool receives the top search results (snippets and URLs).\n      * It feeds this context to the LLM (Gemini) with a prompt like: *\"Based on the following search results, answer the user's question: 'What projects does this organization have?'\"*\n5.  **Output**: The tool returns a structured response containing the synthesized answer and the sources used.\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"status\": \"success\",\n      \"answer\": \"Devr.AI primarily focuses on creating tools for developer relations (DevRel), including AI-powered assistants for community engagement, issue triage, and onboarding. You can explore our main projects on our official website and GitHub page.\",\n      \"sources\": [\n        { \"title\": \"Devr.AI - Official Website\", \"url\": \"https://devr.ai/projects\" },\n        { \"title\": \"Devr.AI on GitHub\", \"url\": \"https://github.com/AOSSIE-Org/Devr.AI\" }\n      ]\n    }\n    ```\n6.  **Final Action**: The DevRel Agent formats this into a helpful message and sends it to the user.\n\n## \uD83D\uDCCB Additional Context\n\nBy aligning the **`FAQ Handler`** with the **Web Search** tool, we ensure a \"single source of truth\": the organization's own website and public materials. This approach is highly scalable and low-maintenance.\n\nTo make this tool effective, the primary task is not to build a database of FAQs, but to ensure that the organization's **website is well-structured and contains clear, findable answers** to these common questions. The success of the `FAQ Handler` is directly tied to the quality of the organization's public-facing content.\n\n### Record\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\n- [ ] I want to work on implementing this feature",

I'll elaborate on my workflow soon.", " **FAQ Handler Implementation:**\n\nI???ve carefully read through the problem statement and I believe this is a high-impact addition to your project.\n\nHere's how I plan to break this down and implement it, step by step:\n\n_Step 1: Question Intent Detection_\n\n- Build a simple NLP classifier (or use keyword-based matching) to determine if the user???s query is a general organizational FAQ (e.g., \"What projects do you have?\" or \"How does Devr.AI work?\").\n\n- This helps trigger the specialized FAQ Handler only for relevant questions.\n\n_Step 2: Dynamic Web Search Tool_\n\n- Use a web search API like:\n\n1. [SerpAPI](https://serpapi.com/) (Google/Bing wrapper),\n2. or DuckDuckGo Search API (open/free).\n\n- Fetch top 3???5 results focused on official sources.\n\n _Step 3: AI-Powered Synthesis_\n\n- Feed the top search results (title, snippet, URL) into an LLM like OpenAI GPT or Gemini using a structured prompt.\n\n- Example prompt:\n\n\"Based on the following search results, answer this user question in a concise and helpful way: 'What projects does Devr.AI work on?'\"\n\n_Step 4: Generate Final Response_\n\n- Parse the LLM output to:\n\n1. Return a clear, user-friendly answer.\n2. Include a list of cited sources.\n\n_Step 5: Integration into the Main Bot or Frontend_\n\n- Package this as a backend endpoint or a callable tool inside your chatbot/workflow agent.\n\n- Ensure it fails gracefully (e.g., no results or poor connectivity ??? fallback message).\n\n**\uD83D\uDD27 Why Me?**\nAlthough I???m new to contributing, I???m genuinely passionate about AI, developer tools, and meaningful open source work. I'm confident I can break this down into clean, maintainable code and deliver something the community will benefit from.\n\nI???d love your feedback or go-ahead to get started!\n\n@smokeyScraper \n\n", "yes @PrithvijitBose, we require this tool to be aligned in a similar way; just with a few changes.\nFor step 1, instead of any keyboard based matching, let there be a thinking node which can align the user's query to well aligned question.\nFor step 2, we already have Tavily as well as DuckDuckGo configured.\nRest flow is correct and we just need to ensure minimal nodes and minimizing calls to the model.\n\n@Rudra775 did a bit of work on this issue too, I think you both can work on this issue together? I'll let you know more on the design details.", "@smokeyScraper sure man, will love to work with like minded people ", "@Rudra775 I am a newbie in Open Source.. but i know about the task..can you help me contribute to this project as well\n\nIt will be a great help for me", "@PrithvijitBose im not an expert either, just trying to learn from everywhere i can. lets connect on discord and discuss. `rudraaa_24`", "Hey @smokeyScraper \uD83D\uDC4B\n\nI've completed the implementation for the `thinking_node` as discussed in #97.  \nPlease Check The PR\nAll checks have passed ???, and I???ve also addressed CodeRabbit's suggestion regarding the import.\n\nThe node now rephrases informal user queries using Gemini (LLM) and routes them more cleanly to the appropriate tool (FAQ or Web Search).\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to make any changes ??? happy to improve it further! \uD83D\uDE80\n" ],

The selected phases should be displayed in one CIF file or in several - one for each phase?", "@AndrewKuncevich Hi Andrew. My thinking is that while a project-based CIF will often have lots of CIF blocks in a single (sometimes huge) file, the quick-CIF should be simple and just have one phase in each file, so part of the task here is to name each file separately. \n\nNote that the relevant code -- I'm pretty sure -- is the routine `ExportPhaseCIF.Exporter()` in file `exports/G2export_CIF.py`. At the moment I am questioning my sanity in tagging this as a \"good 1st issue\" in that it probably will require looking through a bunch of parent classes. Note that class `ExportCIF` is defined in `exports/G2export_CIF.py` from `GSASIIfiles.ExportBaseclass`. I don't think that anything in `ExportBaseclass` will need to be changed. \n\nPlease do ask for help if anything seems hard to follow (if so, my fault). BTW, my first step working on this would be to run the Exporter() code in a debugger (like Spyder or VSCode) to see what the upper-level routine is doing. Or possibly stick in some print statements.

If `param` is a `SubString` (for whatever reason???e.g. because it is parsed somewhere), then \n\n```julia\nsavename(\"something\", (;param), \"txt\")\n```\n\nsilently ignores `param` despite it being given explicitly.

      "description" : "\r\n### Description of the Problem:\r\nWhile working with Gleam version 1.0.0, I attempted to use a function to print a list of numbers to the console but mistakenly omitted the package prefix from the function call. Instead of suggesting the correct function from the imported package, the compiler suggested an unrelated term.\r\n\r\n### Code to Reproduce:\r\n```gleam\r\nimport gleam/io\r\n\r\npub fn main() {\r\n  let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\r\n  debug(numbers) // Intended to use io.debug but mistakenly omitted 'io.'\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior:\r\nI expected the compiler to suggest using `io.debug` or another relevant function from the `gleam/io` package since it was imported and contained functions for console output.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior:\r\nThe compiler identified `debug` as an unknown variable and suggested unrelated terms, missing the opportunity to suggest the correct function from an already imported package.\r\n\r\n**Error Message**:\r\n```\r\nerror: Unknown variable\r\n  ?????? /path/to/project/src/my_project.gleam:5:3\r\n  ???\r\n5 ???   debug(numbers)\r\n  ???   ^^^^^ Did you mean `True`?\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Suggested Improvement:\r\nEnhance the compiler's error suggestions to consider functions available in the imported modules/packages, especially when an unknown function or variable matches a name in those imports. This feature could significantly improve developer experience by providing more contextually relevant suggestions and reducing potential confusion, particularly for newcomers or in cases of simple typos.\r\n\r\n### Additional Context:\r\nThis issue arose when I tried to print a list of numbers without correctly specifying the `io` module prefix for the `debug` function. The current compiler suggestions did not help in guiding me towards the correct usage of imported functions.\r\n\r\n**Gleam Version**: 1.0.0\r\n**Operating System**: macOS Ventura (Version 13.2)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/assets/59015064/416ccaa9-f464-44dc-8230-fc01270b6d57)\r\n\r\n",

Good work guys !", "Hi ! Can I give a shot on this ? I saw that #2715 was closed due to inactivity and it seems not that hard, a really good first issue to explore the codebase !\n\nHowever, there has been a little change since Gleam v1.0.0 and I don't know from which version this behaviour has changed. When I try to run this program with Gleam v1.11.1:\n\n```gleam\nimport gleam/io\n\npub fn main() -> Nil {\n  // Works as expected\n  io.println(\"Hello, World!\")\n\n  // Not working. Should suggest io.println\n  println(\"Hello, World!\")\n}\n```\n\nI got the error about println not in scope, no more weird suggestions:\n\n```sh\nerror: Unknown variable\n  ?????? /home/raphrous/code/gleam/module_suggestion/src/module_suggestion.gleam:8:3\n  ???\n8 ???   println(\"Hello, World!\")\n  ???   ^^^^^^^\n\nThe name `println` is not in scope here.\n```\n\n> You'd need to find where the error is emitted and at that point look to see which (if any) of the imported modules have functions with that name with the same number of arguments. If any are found then you can add the names of the modules to the error and then when printing the error include them in the error message in some way.\n\nI think this is the simplest (and maybe cleanest) way to handle this case. So, is this issue still relevant ?", "Yup still useful feature to have!\n\n> I got the error about println not in scope, no more weird suggestions:\n\nThe \"did you mean\" algorithm was rewritten, it avoids unlikely suggestions now.", "After some experimentation, I need to talk about the implementations and ask a few questions about certain details !\n\nSo far, so good, I've found the important places where I need to modify the source code and I have a first implementation (not that great):\n- the error `UnknownVariable` in `compiler-core/src/type_/error.rs`,\n- the function `report_name_error` in `compiler-core/src/type_/expression.rs`,\n- the function `to_diagnostics` in `compiler-core/src/errors.rs`.\n\nHowever, this new feature should not only suggest functions from imported modules, but all available public values (functions, constants, maybe I have missed a few one). For example, I have tested this program that import `gleam/uri` module with a constant named `empty` and a function named `to_string`. Also, I have imported the `gleam/float` that define another `to_string` function (incompatible with the `empty` constant from `gleam/uri`):\n\n```gleam\n// Only for the println function\nimport gleam/io\n\n// gleam/uri define `empty` constant of type Uri\n// and also `to_string` function\n//   pub fn to_string(uri: Uri) -> String\nimport gleam/uri\n\n// gleam/float define `to_string` function\n//   pub fn to_string(x: Float) -> String\nimport gleam/float\n\nfn main() -> Nil {\n  // In this case, compiler should error because empty is not in the scope\n  // and suggests `uri.empty`\n  io.println(empty |> uri.to_string)\n\n  // In this case, compiler should error because to_string is not in the scope\n  // and suggests `uri.to_string` but not `float.to_string`\n  io.println(uri.empty |> to_string)\n}\n```\nHonestly, I don't know how to not suggest `float.to_string`. At this stage, `to_string` is considered a variable and not necessarily a function call. I don't know if it's possible to get the arity and the type of the arguments to ensure that we are not suggesting a call to a function that does not have the right signature for this particular call.\n\nLet's also, consider this program with 2 `println` functions with the same signature and coming from 2 different modules:\n\n```gleam\n// gleam/io define a println function\n//   pub fn println(string: String) -> Nil\nimport gleam/io\n\n// mymodule/myio also define a println function\n//   pub fn println(string: String) -> Nil\nimport mymodule/myio\n\nfn main() -> Nil {\n  println(\"Hello, World!\")\n}\n```\nI can't suggest only one implementation. A cleaner solution would be to list all available public implementations, I don't know how to make it look good, but maybe something like this (you get the idea):\n\n```sh\nerror: Unknown variable\n  ?????? /home/raphrous/code/gleam/module_suggestion/src/module_suggestion.gleam:8:3\n  ???\n8 ???   println(\"Hello, World!\")\n  ???   ^^^^^^^\n\nThe name `println` is not in scope here.\nHint: did you mean to use one of the following implementations: `io.println`,  `myio.println` ?\n```\n\nNow two questions if you have the time to answer:\n- Is it possible to get the arity and the type of the arguments at this stage?\n- When two concurrent functions can be suggested, what do we do and also which format to choose?\n\nPS: Sorry for the long message, I did not know how to make it shorter \uD83E\uDD7A" ],

Models are currently packaged as CPU-only Docker images. The goal of this project is to evaluate and implement GPU support using Docker.\n\n## Goals\n\n- Demonstrate that a model can run inside a Docker container with GPU access.\n- Build the foundation to support GPU in the Ersilia infrastructure (template, CLI, metadata, CI/CD).\n- Benchmark performance between CPU and GPU runs.\n\n## Step 1: Manual GPU Docker Test (Top-Down)\n\nWe will first verify that models can run in a GPU-enabled Docker container, without relying on Ersilia's internal infrastructure (e.g., CLI or model template).\n\n- [ ] Select two test models:\n  - [ ] One **GPU-only** model (TBD).\n  - [ ] One **GPU/CPU-compatible** model (suggested: FAISS-based).\n- [ ] Set up the new GPU workstation.\n- [ ] Choose and test an appropriate CUDA base image (e.g., `nvidia/cuda:...`).\n- [ ] Ensure image size is acceptable (<~4GB ideally).\n- [ ] Run tests on:\n  - [ ] At least two local GPU workstations.\n  - [ ] One cloud instance (e.g., AWS GPU instance).\n\n## Step 2: Integrate GPU Support into Ersilia Infrastructure\n\n### \uD83E\uDDF1 At the [Ersilia Template](https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos-template) level\n\n- [ ] How should `install.yml` indicate GPU requirements?\n- [ ] If model code differs between CPU/GPU, how should this be reflected in the `framework/`?\n\n### ?????? At the [Ersilia CLI](https://github.com/ersilia-os/ersilia) level\n\n- [ ] Add support for `--gpu` or `--cpu` flags in the `ersilia serve` command.\n- [ ] Decide whether GPU/CPU mode should be:\n  - Explicit (user-defined via flag), or\n  - Automatic (detect from hardware?)\n- [ ] Assess: Can one image support both CPU and GPU, or do we need separate ones?\n\n### \uD83D\uDCE6 At the [Ersilia Metadata](https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos5axz/blob/main/metadata.json) level\n\n- [ ] Add `runtime: GPU` / `CPU` or similar field.\n- [ ] Consider `requirements` or `compatibility` sections if needed.\n\n### \uD83D\uDC33 On [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/ersiliaos)\n\n- [ ] Should GPU-compatible images use a separate tag (e.g., `model:gpu`) or separate repo?\n- [ ] Define tagging convention early.\n\n## Step 3: GitHub Actions & CI Integration\n\nIn the [Ersilia Model Workflows](https://github.com/ersilia-os/ersilia-model-workflows):\n\n- [ ] Detect whether a model supports GPU.\n- [ ] Build and push a GPU-compatible Docker image (using `nvidia-docker`).\n- [ ] Ensure existing workflows are not broken.\n\nIn the [Ersilia CLI CI/CD](https://github.com/ersilia-os/ersilia):\n\n- [ ] Add at least one unit test to check GPU execution (on GitHub-hosted runners or self-hosted runner with GPU).\n\n## Step 4: Benchmarking & Validation\n\n- [ ] Run performance benchmarks:\n  - CPU vs GPU execution time.\n  - Memory consumption and constraints.\n- [ ] Record any limitations or environment-specific requirements.",

There might be more than one GPU in a device and either we have to select one device or sharding tasks accross all available GPUs\n- [x] not only nvidia binary but also other accelerators.", "- [x] Set up the new GPU workstation.\n\n- [ ] Select two test models:\n\n   - [ ] One GPU-only model \n\n   - [x] One GPU/CPU-compatible model (suggested: FAISS-based).\n\n- [x] Choose and test an appropriate CUDA base image (e.g., nvidia/cuda:...).\n\n\n## CUDA Base Image: \n\nNvidia has 3 \"flavours\" images `base`, `runtime` and `devel`. `runtime` seems to be the most appropriate for our use case, necessary runtime and Mathematics Libraries, NCCL and optionally cudNN. For example : \n\n```nvidia/cuda:12.9.0-runtime-ubuntu24.04```\n\nThis comes to ~ 2 GB/3 GB depending on the exact CUDA and Ubuntu Version being used. \n\nIdeally run automated tests/builds for different combinations of Ubuntu (or other distributions?) and CUDA  versions. \n\n## CPU vs GPU preliminary testing\n\nA very simple test on TabPFN using a [Sci-Kit Learn Breast Cancer Dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html) showed approximately 3x-4x speed ups when GPU access to the process was enabled, compared to CPU only runs (on the Norrsken GPU Workstation).\n\nMore detailed tests using a [Dataset of approximately 2 Million Compounds](https://github.com/ersilia-os/sars-cov-2-chemspace/blob/main/data/reference_library_inchikeys.csv) showed overwhelming speed-ups with GPU Accelerated similarity searches using [FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss), the difference between search times of GPU and CPU implementations scaled/diverged with the Index size. **It is clearly worth trying to accelerate models using GPU Acceleration.**\n\nWe built indices out of Count Fingerprints of the compounds (converted the SMILES to 2048 Vectors). Cosine Similarity was used as a metric. \n\nFAISS does not support cosine by default, so we use  an `Inner Product` index and perform L2 (Euclidean) Normalisation on the vectors before adding to them to the index (or before searching), which is the equivalent of using Cosine similarity.\n\nTests were ran with index sizes of `10,000`, `100,000`, `500,000` and `1,000,000`. Nearest 100 Neighbours. \n\n### Index size 100,000:\n| Number of Searches | CPU (s) | GPU (s) |\n|--------------------|---------|---------|\n| 100                | 1       | 0.01    |\n| 1,000              | 7.08    | 0.04    |\n| 10,000             | 67.49   | 0.11    |\n| 100,000            | >350    | 1.30    |\n| 500,000            | -       | 5.50    |\n\n### Index size 1,000,000\n\n| Number of Searches | CPU (s) | GPU (s) |\n|--------------------|---------|---------|\n| 100                | 9.42    | 0.02    |\n| 1,000              | 71      | 0.10    |\n| 10,000             | 711     | 1.03    |\n| 100,000            | -       | 10.45   |\n| 500,000            | -       | 52.50   |\n\n\n\n### \n\n<img width=\"765\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e39adae0-7c06-43ba-ba5f-3da89037da02\" />\n\n_NOTE: GPUs are typically higher latency but have higher parallel throughput and memory bandwidth than CPUs. It is best to use batch queries with the CPU or GPU as this amortises the touching of index memory across all of the queries and this is when GPU speed ups are convenient. We will most likely not see any improvements in GPU search times with single queries (if anything it might be slower because of GPU overhead)._\n\n\nThe examples of inference time comparisons and a 3D plot (inference time against index and query sizes), clearly demonstrate **GPUs provide absolutely non-trivial speed ups for the right tasks.**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "# Very Heavy Index (FAISS Flat)\n\nFlat (IP and L2 for example) indices are extremely large (because FAISS only supports Float32 vectors, hence each Fingerprint vector is 32 * 2048 = 65,536 Bits or 4 * 2048=8,192  Bytes), scaling up to millions of vectors means we are dealing with indices that are 10s of GBs.\n\nTried FPSim2 but there are no benefits to GPU accelerating since it does not support batch queries (could be worth looking into CUDA Programming and tuning it to support batch queries, as it supports Sparse Vectors and Tanimoto Search on GPU)\n\n## Promising alternative to Flat FAISS Index: **Approximate Nearest Neighbour (ANN) search**\n\nMost methods for ANN require index training and parameter tuning which makes building the index more complex. We also need to ensure that the training sample is diverse. \n\nPlease note the difference between training and adding to Indices. And index cannot be trained incrementally but can be incrementally added to.\n\nMemory bottlenecks are also an issue so I first train the index and then add vectors to it incrementally in batches. (Although, it is suggested, If possible at all,  add more compute at index build time. (Especially if the index does not change a lot over time))\n\nThe following ANN methods are explored and suggested (compared to ~16 GB with a flat index of around 1.99 million Vectors)\n\n### **_IVFPQ (Inverted File Index with Product Quantisation):_** \n\n#### **_I am yet to do Accuracy tests on IVFPQ but with computational performance (inference time), models seem to enjoy GPU Acceleration speed ups similar to those mentioned above for FAISS Flat indices._**\n\nThis creates very light indices: `~93 MB for an index of around 1.99 Million Vectors`, but there might be a non-trivial loss of accuracy. \n\nNote: For some reason after the index is trained and incrementally built, FAISS takes a lot of time to write it to disk which makes it look like the process is frozen but isn't actually frozen - it goes into an \"uninterruptible sleep\" because of Disk IO, as indicated by the \"D\" state in htop. \n\n### **_HNSWSQ (Hierarchical Navigable Small World Index with Scalar Quantisation)_**\n\nTraining is reasonably fast (with GPU) but adding vectors is computationally intensive and needs to batched appropriately.\n\n#### **_I am yet to do Accuracy tests on HNSWSQ but with computational performance , HNSW seem to enjoy GPU Acceleration only with at Training time as indices are pretty compact and are VERY FAST with CPU and FAISS does not have a GPU search for this yet._**\n\nWhen choosing the strength of quantisation, there is a trade off between memory and accuracy:\n\nIndex of **1.99 million Vectors**:\n\n```\n4.63 GB (~2KB Per Vector + overhead) with a  8-Bit Quantiser while maintaining around 95-98% Accuracy^\n\n\n\n2.59 GB (~1.15KB Per Vector + overhead) with a 4-Bit Quantiser  while maintaining around 90-95% Accuracy^\n```\n\n\nAdding vectors to this kind of index is slow.\n\n_^accuracy according to official documentation and third party tests_\n", "# Metric Learning - Embedding Model\n\nAnother alternative to using vanilla flat indices with 2048 dimensional fingerprints we explore is the use of a metric learning model to create embeddings that are lower dimensions. We use these embeddings to create flat FAISS indices that are much lighter than the standard fingerprint indices (512, 256, 128, 100 dimensional embeddings vs 2048 dimensional fingerprints). We uses torch's GPU version and enjoy non-trivial speed-ups at training time, while creating embeddings and inference time (FAISS Search using a GPU index).\n\nNote: The searches are performed on a flat index, hence are exact searches, but the using of the embedding model means there is an approximation.", "We are aiming to create compound similarity search models with 4 compound libraries:\n\n- ChemDiv (100k)\n- A representative of Enamine  (~9 million)\n- DrugBank (~11k)\n- COCONUT (should be between 500k and 1 Million)\n\nWe also create a _Metric Learning Embedding Model_ out of a [reference library of 2 million compounds.](https://github.com/ersilia-os/sars-cov-2-chemspace/blob/main/data/reference_library_inchikeys.csv).\n\nFor each of the above libraries the aim is to have 3 variants of indices:\n\n- _A flat IP index with L2 Normalisation_\n    - This is going to be very large for libraries with 500k+ compounds)\n\n- _A compressed IVFPQ IP index  with L2 normalisation (FAISS compression)_\n   - This creates very light indices but as mentioned above there is a loss of search accuracy\n\n- _A flat index created with embeddings from the above mentioned model._\n   - This is lets us create indices that are lighter than vanilla flat indices and also lets us have control and confidence over the accuracy of the search (given that we are confident in the embedding model, which is arguably simpler to benchmark).\n \n", "Implemented a metric learning pipeline that creates learned embeddings from existing flat FAISS index. \n\n### Transforms 2048-dimensional fingerprints ??? _256/128/100-dimensional learned embeddings_ with cosine similarity\n\n### Triplet sampling: Uses existing 2M compound FAISS index for mining hard positives/negatives\n\nEvaluations: ROC-AUC, AP, distance distributions, t-SNE visualizations\n\nThe pipeline maintains L2 normalization throughout for FlatIP cosine similarity and includes model checkpointing + SMILES mapping for deployment.\n\nCreated with PyTorch + FAISS GPU. ", "@dhrvrc to close the internship please update this issue with a summary of where the developed resources can be found as well as the documentation associated to them. \n\nFor example: the conclusion of this project has resulted in two model incorporations (add summary of why they are related to the GPU incorporation)\n\n- https://github.com/ersilia-os/ersilia/issues/1699\n- https://github.com/ersilia-os/ersilia/issues/1697\n\nand \n...", "Hi everyone, thanks for the detailed breakdown, this is super insightful!\n\nI just had a small thought while reading through the benchmarking and index optimizations. Since you're already exploring multiple types of FAISS indices and embedding strategies (like IVFPQ, HNSWSQ, and metric learning), would it be worth considering adding a metadata field in the model hub that reflects the index type and embedding strategy used (e.g., flat, IVFPQ, embedding model version)?\n\nThis might make it easier down the line for users (and maintainers) to:\n\n* Quickly assess what kind of GPU support or performance to expect\n\n* Compare models or indices in similar domains\n\n* Reproduce or build upon existing pipelines with more transparency\n\nAlso, happy to help brainstorm or prototype how this metadata could be structured if it???s of interest.

It seems to happen specifically when it???s an inter-state transaction involving an internal customer, and Update Stock is set to true.\n\nFrom what I noticed, if account details are missing at the item or customer level, there's no fallback to a default account (like one set at the company level), which might be the reason for this error. Would it make sense to display a warning in such cases or possibly apply a fallback using the company???s default account?\n\nAlso, if it helps, I can try creating a unit test to replicate this scenario. It might make debugging easier and help prevent similar issues going forward. Let me know what you think!" ],

It seems to be happening in a specific case, when it's an inter-state transaction involving an internal customer, and Update Stock is set to true.\n\nFrom what I observed, if account details are missing at the item or customer level, there's no fallback to a default account (like one set at the company level), which might be causing this issue. Would it make sense to show a warning in such cases or maybe have a fallback mechanism using the company's default account?\n\nAlso, if it helps, I can try setting up a unit test that replicates this scenario.

This will provide several benefits:\n\n- Improved Code Readability: Type hints clearly document the expected input and output types, making the code easier to understand.\n- Reduced Errors: Static type checking can catch potential errors during development, preventing runtime issues.\n- Enhanced Developer Experience: IDEs can leverage type hints for auto-completion and other helpful features, improving the overall development experience.\n",

A silent failure is not a great way to go about this. Considering this only affects a monitoring resource, I think it is tolerable.\n\nI also dug out the original Issue that introduced this check: https://github.com/external-secrets/external-secrets/issues/2547\nThere was a circular dependency, which lead to the silent disabling of the resource being added.\n\nIn our use case we are are deploying external-secrets and kube-prometheus-stack with flux, which would possibly allows an initial release without the ServiceMonitor to apply successfully, followed by kube-prometheus-stack, followed by the next reconcile of external-secrets deploying the ServiceMonitor. So keeping this error silent softens dependencies on initial installation using gitops and improves user experience.", "thanks for tracking this down \uD83D\uDE04. \n\nI still don't like this behavior, tbh.. but at that point in time this would be a breaking change to users :/", "I've added a warning to the NOTES.txt that service monitors haven`t been deployed because of the missing CRD." ],

      "description" : "## Issue: KYC Modal Integration and Flow Assembly\n\nWelcome aboard. We're glad to have you contributing to **KindFi**, a Web3 crowdfunding platform for real-world impact. This issue involves assembling and connecting the full KYC verification process in the KindFi modal component. This is a key milestone before we integrate with the live KYC server.\n\n---\n\n### Background\n\nAll five components for the KYC process have been implemented individually in issues #192, #193, #194, #195, #196. However, these components are not yet connected in a seamless flow within the modal. Your task is to integrate them into a single cohesive user experience.\n\n---\n\n### Objectives\n\nConnect all the KYC verification steps within the modal and create necessary files, actions, and hooks to prepare for server integration.\n\n---\n\n### Tasks\n\n1. **Connect all KYC steps in the modal**:\n   - Uncomment and properly integrate the imports in `kyc-modal.tsx`\n   - Implement the full KYC step flow (Steps 1???5) with correct state transitions\n   - Ensure data flows correctly between steps and is maintained in modal state\n\n2. **Create necessary API integration files**:\n   - Create API client functions for communication with the KYC server\n   - Include error handling and retry logic\n   - Show appropriate loading and success/failure states to the user\n\n3. **Implement KYC hooks and centralized state management**:\n   - Develop a context or hook to manage overall KYC state\n   - Ensure state persistence through browser refreshes or navigation\n   - Validate inputs across all steps\n\n4. **Testing and Documentation**:\n   - Write comprehensive tests for each step and the full flow\n   - Document how the integration works for future contributors\n---\n\n### Contribution Checklist\n\n- [ ] Join our **Telegram community** to stay updated and connect with maintainers and contributors.

Implement Efficient State Management\n- **Refactor State Handling:** Optimize how KYC steps are stored and retrieved to ensure better performance and maintainability.\n- **Context API/Zustand Integration:** Implement a centralized state management system using **Zustand** for consistent and efficient state updates across the verification flow.\n\n### 2. Cleanup and Prepare for Server Integration\n- **Modularize Verification Steps:** Break down KYC verification steps into reusable and composable components.\n- **Ensure Server-Readiness:** Structure the codebase to seamlessly integrate API responses and minimize refactoring when backend endpoints are available.\n- **Implement Loading and Error States:** Improve user feedback by adding clear loading indicators and error handling for each verification step.\n\n### 3. Improve Form Handling\n- **Validation Enhancements:** Retest and Ensure that KYC input fields are properly validated before submitting data to the server.\n- **Optimize API Calls:** Ensure efficient data submission.\n\n## Technical Implementation\n\n- **Framework:** Next.js 14 for optimal SSR and SSG support.\n- **State Management:** Zustand for efficient global state handling.\n- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui for consistent UI components.\n- **API Integration:** Prepare API handlers and types for seamless integration with the backend.\n\n## Timeline\n\nI plan to deliver a draft pull request within **48-72 hours**, covering:\n\n- Refactored state management for KYC verification steps.\n- Cleanup of existing verification flow to prepare for API integration.\n- Implementation of error handling, validation, and UI feedback improvements.\n\nFurther refinements will be made based on feedback and testing.\n\n## Availability\n\nI am ready to dedicate the necessary time and effort to ensure the successful and timely completion of this feature.

Esto es por el pre-commit. Aseg??rate primero de tener bien instalados Husky y Biome, que son cruciales en KindFi. Una vez que eso est?? listo, deber??as poder hacer commits sin problema. El tema con esto es que siempre es necesario tener corriendo el repo, as?? que vas a necesitar una terminal con el repo en ejecuci??n y otra terminal para hacer los commits. De esa forma, no deber??a fallar.

So seniors can upload past year papers and pyqs. \n\n## Motivation\nThis feature is needed as PYQS are an important part of exam preparation so they'll need a feature like this. \n\n## Possible Solution\nI will make an \"Add PYQs\" option on the main page which will direct to pyqs.html.  Then write pyqs.html where I will give an option to either input the questions individually or an image of a last year paper of that particular subject and semester. \n\n## Additional Context\nPlease assign this task to me under the label - gssoc. \nThank You. \n",

The Sign Up button especially feels out of place it's slightly floating and not inline with the rest.\n\n2.Dropdown Filters Layout:\nThe dropdowns for Branch, Semester, and Subject aren???t uniformly spaced or aligned. They appear slightly unbalanced on larger screens.\n\n3.Card Formatting:\nThe notes card (Mathematics I) lacks proper padding and spacing.\nThe \"Download\" link feels too close to the text above it a bit more vertical spacing would help.\n\n4.Overall Spacing and Alignment:\nThere's some inconsistency between sections, for example, between the filters and the card section.\n\n<img width=\"1915\" height=\"420\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb4d6b78-a321-4973-a37d-6cc558ffb327\" />\n\nKindly assign the issue to me @Aditya-Patwa @adityai0 , so that I can try to resolve it.",

Similarly we can have feature-gated `u32_to_usize` and `usize_to_u64` for cases where we don't support 16-bit platforms.\n\nYes, this means that the code doing integer casts in `const` context will become longer but I think it's starting to be worth it since there are many casts and I already got confused by some code.\n\nThis issue is easy in principle but involves a bunch of changes.",

The changes maintain consistency with the SPD framework's goal of learning causal importance functions rather than 'gates'.\n\n?????? **Manual Steps Required**: Due to insufficient permissions, the following steps need to be completed manually:\n1. **Testing**: Run `python -m pytest` or equivalent to ensure no regressions\n2. **Linting**: Run linting tools if available (e.g., `ruff`, `flake8`)  \n3. **Commit**: `git add .` and `git commit` the changes\n4. **Push**: `git push origin claude/issue-48-20250723-1330`\n5. **Create PR**: Use the link below to create a pull request\n\nThe implementation is ready for integration once these manual steps are completed.\n\n---" ],

The following sections will be managed by moderators only._\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n\n* Reader Revenue Management module is referencing the `isURLUsingHTTPS` util function from `assets/js/util/is-url-using-https.js` instead of the local one located in the `assets/js/modules/reader-revenue-manager/utils/validation.js`\n* `isURLUsingHTTPS` function is removed from `assets/js/modules/reader-revenue-manager/utils/validation.js` file\n\n## Implementation brief\n\n1. In following files update the import path for `isURLUsingHTTPS`.\n  - assets/js/modules/reader-revenue-manager/index.js\n  - assets/js/modules/reader-revenue-manager/utils/validation.test.js\n\n2. Remove `isURLUsingHTTPS` from `assets/js/modules/reader-revenue-manager/utils/validation.js` file.\n\n### Test coverage\n\nNo additional test change required.\n\n## QA Brief\n\n1. Test on a non https site that we get the warning for RRM module that site should be on https.\n2. Run a quick smoke test around RRM module that everything is functioning normally as before.\n\n## Changelog entry\n\n* N/A.\n",

      "url" : "https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow/issues/6301",
      "repositoryName" : "nextflow-io/nextflow",
      "description" : "## New feature\n\nHey! There is a CLI argument to clone repositories at a specified depth in a `nextflow run` call:\n\n```\n    -d, -deep\n       Create a shallow clone of the specified depth\n```\n\nbut it seems like this does not propagate to any git submodules. Additionally, submodule configuration for shallow clones via the `shallow = true` configuration option in a `.gitmodules` file does not seem to be honored.\n\nI propose that the specified depth also apply to all git submodules in the cloned repository. I also propose that when not given as an argument the clone should honor the configuration option in the `.gitmodules` file for each submodule.\n\n## Use case\n\nThe pipeline we are developing has multiple submodules, some with a large git history (27k commits!). We also have a submodule that we use to share common test cases and associated data across multiple repositories (this one has 13k commits). We'd like to avoid cloning the entirety of the commit history for these repositories, since the only thing that matters in the context of a given `nextflow run` call is the specific commit being pointed to for each submodule.\n\nOur current workaround is to clone the repository ahead of time with `--shallow-submodules` and then point to that path, but it would be nice to have it all configurable on the nextflow CLI.\n\n## Suggested implementation\n\nI have tried looking through the source code in here related to cloning git repositories, as well as through [jgit](https://github.com/eclipse-jgit/jgit), which seems to be the library being used to orchestrate cloning. My java/groovy skills are not the greatest so correct me if I am wrong, but it seems like to me that jgit does not support shallow cloning of submodules or setting submodule depths. I'm not sure what the best path forward is with that in mind.\n",

We can replace this popup with a full page that we already use as confirmation.**\n\n**Your task will be to check that all the issues have been correctly developed, that the components are properly arranged, and that everything matches exactly as in the Figma design:**\n\nhttps://www.figma.com/design/S1UKYgWewNqNHZFAaBUilG/%F0%9F%8F%9D%EF%B8%8F-Starknet-ID?node-id=7022-31922&t=XCt8XQUo4vZRtmIv-1\n\n### Purpose of the Issue\nThe goal of this issue is to finalize the redesign of the confirmation page that appears after activating a subscription on the Starknet ID platform. The current popup will be replaced with a full confirmation page, ensuring all components are properly developed and aligned with the Figma design.\n\n- **Alignment with Figma Design**:\n  - Check that all components are correctly arranged and match exactly as shown in the Figma file linked in the issue description.\n\n### Actions to Take\n1. **Review Sub-Issues**:\n   - Verify that each sub-issue (#1110???#1114) has been implemented according to specifications.\n   \n2. **Testing**:\n   - Test all functionalities locally, including navigation, button redirects, and visual alignment.\n   \n3. **Final Adjustments**:\n   - Ensure consistency across all elements (images, text, buttons) and fix any discrepancies between the implementation and the Figma design.\n\n4. **Commit and Submit**:\n   - Create a final commit summarizing changes (e.g., `git commit -m \"Final review: confirmation page redesign\"`).\n   - Submit a pull request for review and approval.\n\n### Constraints\n- All components must strictly follow the Figma design.\n- Testing should cover both functionality and visual accuracy.\n- This issue serves as a final review, so attention to detail is critical.\n\n\n## Proposed Actions \uD83D\uDEE0???\n\nHere???s a checklist of actions to follow for resolving this issue:\n\n1. **Fork and Create Branch**:  \n   Fork the repository and create a new branch using the issue number:\n   ```bash\n   git checkout -b fix-[issue-number]\n   ```\n\n2. **Implement Changes**:  \n\t[Insert Code snippet if needed with a mardown todo list]\n\n3. **Run Tests and Commit Changes**:  \n   Make sure your changes don't break existing functionality and commit with a clear message:\n   ```bash\n   git commit -m \"Fix: [Short description of the fix]\"\n   ```\n\n## Required \uD83D\uDCCB\n\nTo keep our workflow smooth, please make sure you follow these guidelines:\n\n- **Assignment**: Don't create a pull request if you weren???t assigned to this issue.\n- **Timeframe**: Complete the task within **3 business days**.\n- **Closing the Issue**: In your PR description, close the issue by writing `Close #[issue_id]`.\n- **Review Process**:\n  - Once you've submitted your PR, change the label to **\"ready for review\"**.\n  - If changes are requested, address them and then update the label back to **\"ready for review\"** once done.\n- **Testing**: Test your PR locally before pushing, and verify that tests and build are working after pushing.\n\nThank you for your contribution \uD83D\uDE4F\n\n??????

Thanks for showing interest in improving TalkHeal, looking forward to your response!", "Hi @eccentriccoder01,\n\nThanks for getting back to me! I'm happy to clarify my plan.\n\nMy proposal focuses on making the sidebar more intuitive by grouping related items. Here's a quick breakdown of the changes I have in mind:\n\nGroup Urgent Help: I plan to place the \"Emergency Help\" button and the \"Crisis Support\" link together at the very top. This makes critical support instantly visible and accessible.\n\nCreate Clear Sections: To tidy up the list, I'll group \"Mental Health Check\" and \"Resources & Knowledge Base\" under a \"Tools\" section, and move \"About TalkHeal\" to the bottom, which is a more standard placement.\n\nTo answer your final question, these changes are purely layout and styling. My goal is to improve the existing user experience and visual consistency without altering any core functionality.\n\nI believe these adjustments will make the sidebar feel cleaner and more organized for users", "Thanks for the clarification, @KadimiJaswanth !\nYour plan to improve the sidebar's structure and flow sounds great. Assigning this issue to you, 2 days for this, all the best!" ],

      "description" : "Part of #12048\n\n## Issue\nAfter most of the Unit Test migration in #12048, there are a lot of inconsistencies in access control test methods. This is because we did not migrate the many convenient, abstracted, and commonly used access control test methods from `ui/webapi/BaseActionTest.java` to `sqlui/webapi/BaseActionTest.java`.\n\nAfter merging #13254, all of the access control test methods in `BaseActionTest.java` have been migrated. Hence, this issue aims to refactor the unit test access controls to use these convenient test methods.\n\n## Progress\nThe progress for this refactoring can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IcB-viJMrIOknYoBYasBuRBK9qnwY0-doEK4_Eb24IA/edit?gid=0#gid=0). I (the author) will update it when completed PRs are merged proactively.\n\n## Steps to Contribute\n\n1. Choose test(s) to work on in the above Google Sheets link\n2. Check that no on else have claimed the test cases to work on within the last 2 weeks, or that it has been completed by follow up PRs (but not updated in the sheets)\n3. Comment on this issue to indicate that you'd like to contribute on the chosen test(s). Update your comment if you need more than 2 weeks so that other contributors don't overlap with your work.\n4. Create a PR to refactor the unit test(s).\n5. Submit the PR, with a link to this issue by starting the description with \"Part of #13304\". \n6. Tag me or any other active reviewers and wait for us to review (so that we can get a notification)\n\n## Tips\n\n- Understand the access control test methods in `sqlui/webapi/BaseActionTest.java`, follow the refactoring in #13254\n- Most of the access control testing logic in the migrated unit tests under `sqlui/webapi` follows the old unit tests under `ui/webapi`, so you may wish to reference the old unit test for help",

As an alternative, could the Xamarin defaults be set in an earlier import?", "> As an alternative, could the Xamarin defaults be set in an earlier import?\r\n\r\nXamarin plugs its platform targets - `Microsoft.iOS.Sdk.targets`, that in turn import `Xamarin.Shared.Sdk.targets` which set feature switch configuration, through `AfterMicrosoftNETSdkTargets` property which gets imported last in: https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/afab26398e223c8de604acacca346e1e4306de0f/src/Tasks/Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks/targets/Microsoft.NET.Sdk.targets#L1480 or in other words, after ILLink targets have already been imported:\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/afab26398e223c8de604acacca346e1e4306de0f/src/Tasks/Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks/targets/Microsoft.NET.Sdk.targets#L1439\r\n\r\nI think that changing the order of imports here is too risky.

Instead of ILLink/ILCompiler targets setting these, we could delay giving them a default value until right before the value is needed (i.e. we could set it right before `Defaults @(RuntimeHostConfigurationOption) items based on MSBuild properties.` in the file).", "> Did we consider moving the defaults to Microsoft.NET.Sdk.targets?\n\nCould work, but I see two potential concerns:\n- It's technically a breaking change for any MSBuild logic that was checking any of these properties after the Microsoft.NET.ILLink.targets (but before the Microsoft.NET.Sdk.targets import). Probably uncommon, but the break makes me a little uncomfortable.\n- There are some new switches in .NET 9. If we put all defaults into the Sdk.targets they will result in extra RuntimeHostConfigurationOptions for apps that target .NET 8 (because the ILLink targets are TFM-specific, but the Sdk targets are not).", "IMHO the defaults should be set as late as possible, in particular because we change `PublishTrimmed` in a target: https://github.com/dotnet/macios/blob/63ccc8798cebb12fce1c262ea16ef9c818ea25d4/dotnet/targets/Xamarin.Shared.Sdk.targets#L299-L314, so anything that depends on a particular value of `PublishTrimmed` may get the wrong defaults otherwise." ],

Changes I have made in the Windows version since the last backup, which are not in the Linux version**\n\n\"header_hide_logo\":false,\n\"header_position\":\"normal\",\n\"hide_clip_button\":\"hidden\",\n\"hide_save_button\":\"normal\",\n\"player_autoplay_button\":false,\n\"player_cinema_mode_button\":false,\n\"player_forced_volume\":false,\n\"player_loudness_normalization\":true,\n\"player_popup_button\":false,\n\"player_repeat_button\":false,\n\"player_volume\":9,\n\"remove_member_only\":true,\n\"title_version\":true,\n\n### **These below are the differences in settings that exist in both .json files**\n\n\"hide_share_button\":\"icons_only\", changed to \"hide_share_button\":\"hidden\",\n\"lastDarkTheme\":\"night\", changed to \"lastDarkTheme\":\"sunset\",\n\"lastLightTheme\":\"custom\", changed to \"lastLightTheme\":\"desert\",\n\"player_color\":\"amber\", changed to \"player_color\":\"default\",\n\"theme\":\"night\", changed to \"theme\":\"sunset\",\n\nThis is a good place to start I think.\n\nI also reloaded the old settings to the windows version and all seems to be fine with those settings, too. Which I was hoping would not be the case. Some interaction between settings and browser and OS makes it more complicated to diagnose.", "Ok so I fixed the Linux YouTube Playlists last night.\n\n- First, I backed up my settings from Windows Improve YouTube\n- Went to my broken Linux version\n- Opened Improve YouTube settings and clicked _backup&reset_ > _reset all settings_ \n- Opened a new tab and went to a playlist; it was fixed\n- Then I imported the settings I backed up earlier\n- Opened a new tab and checked the playlist and it still worked fine\n\nIt still worked today after booting up so looks like this fixed it for me.\n\nIf you backup your settings, reset them, then re-import them, checking playlists between each step; it may fix it for you, too.\n\nIf not, try switching to the settings in the last post above, that have changed between both .json files and repeat the steps.\n\nHopefully someone can piece together why first resetting and then re-importing my newer .json file fixed this weirdness.\nIf just saving, resetting, re-importing fixes others' playlists, we can rule out the change in settings between backups at least.", "I'm experiencing this issue as of today, with thumbnails stretched as wide as the layout allows in both playlists and channel pages. This issue started happening right after I accidentally changed the \"Thumbnails per row\" setting (for which there's no reset button turn back the default behavior). Any value I set to it doesn't affect this issue.\n\nTried backing up my settings, clearing all settings in the extension using the \"Reset all settings\" button inside the extension's backup settings, and modifying my settings.json file to remove the thumbnails setting before loading it back to the extension. However, while the number of thumbnails per row returned to the normal value used by youtube, the stretched thumbnails still appear, even though I removed the setting that caused this issue.\n\nMight try later to fully reinstall the extension and see if that works. \n\nBrowser: Firefox 140 on Linux.\n\nUpdate: Clearing extension settings while on a channel page instantly fixes the problem, but as soon as I import my settings again, the issue reappears. Reinstalling didn't work either, since it pulled my synchronized settings.\n\nUpdate 2: Ended up just resetting extension settings and restoring my configuration manually. Tried checking the json for any extraneous settings that might have been changed, but nothing stood out as the source for the issue. Clearing cookies didn't help either, just in case.", "Same here, reset settings and restoring my configuration manually and the bug isn't reproduced. Have to hard refresh a couple times for theming to properly change, but again, bug not reproduced. ", "> Same here, reset settings and restoring my configuration manually and the bug isn't reproduced. Have to hard refresh a couple times for theming to properly change, but again, bug not reproduced.\n\n\nSo the issue is fixed for you then? No synchronisation, manual backup, reset settings, check a playlist, re-import settings, restart browser, check playlist. No messing with settings or .json file in between any steps.\nThat's what seems to work for me.\n\nI have 'four thumbnails per row' on Windows and 'five' on Linux. They are both fine. Changing them after this is fixed may break it again. I am not willing to do that. This bug ruins YouTube for me, I use playlists a lot." ],

This issue can be seen via the following steps:\n\n- Load up the project on Docker\n- Change the project to dark mode if it's not already\n- Visit `/home`\n- Open one of the sidebar menu groups like `Create`\n- Hover over one of the menu options like `Create organization`\n- Notice that the icon is orange, but the text is still white\n- The text should be orange like the icon `cta-orange`",

Author: says \"Translated using Weblate to <language>\" but commit may contain many other languages\n2. Language: the least worst, but mixes potentially harmful contributions with valid contributions in a single commit, loses authorship\n3. Into one commit: Just everything specific is lost in the end.\n\n### Describe the solution you would like\n\nInstead of squashing based only on those properties specifically, squash based on the author and the language. That way, contributions to multiple files are squashed into one, quick changes in other commits are squashed, but authorship isn't lost, and it becomes easier to find issues.\n\n\n### Describe alternatives you have considered\n\nI can't think of much else, I like this approach, microG seems to do this manually which I found very nice\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

Especially with the codec pipeline in zarr being parallelized, the need for dask workers to be responsible for speeding up io is lessened and thus cramming more parallel reads within a worker is probably sensible.  I imagine the same is true for hdf5 even if it isn't parallel i.e., doing more/bigger reads per-dask-chunk.\n\nSee https://gist.github.com/lgarrison/ef2922fdb8ca78e8753c39758afedb56 for a related example of this issue where having few python process workers but utilizing the rust-based parallelization of `zarrs` improves throughput.\n\nSee https://github.com/zarrs/zarr_benchmarks/blob/9679f36ca795cce65adc603ae41147324208d3d9/scripts/zarr_dask_python_benchmark_roundtrip.py#L22 for using `shards` as the chunk size for dask (since shards contain chunks) as a starting point for implementing better defaults.\n\nIn general some todos:\n\n- [ ] Use shards when applicable for zarr\n- [ ] Create benchmarks for unsharded data in hdf5 and zarr to find the virtual vs. on-disk chunk size performance tradeoff\n- [ ] Write some sort of general-purpose function that can be reused across zarr/hdf5",

      "description" : "## Feature Description\n\nStarting in #10165 it was proposed to refactor several methods that hook into the `googlesitekit_inline_modules_data` filter, so they are consolidated into a single method `get_inline_data` that will return all data in the single method.\n\nFor consistency, we should do this in all modules, and preferably enforce this as with an interface. We can create `Module_With_Inline_data` interface that will force adding `get_inline_data` method, and new trait `Module_With_Inline_Data_Trait` that will include `register_inline_data` method, which will hook into the `googlesitekit_inline_modules_data` filter and invoke `get_inline_data` method.\n\nWe can then refactor all modules to use this new interface and trait, and it should be used in all new modules that are created in the future.\n\n---------------\n\n_Do not alter or remove anything below. The following sections will be managed by moderators only._\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n\n* New interface `Module_With_Inline_Data` is introduced to enforce the presence of a unified method on any module that provides inline data.\n* New trait `Module_With_Inline_Data_Trait` is introduced to include a registration method - which will hook into the `googlesitekit_inline_modules_data` and use the interface enforced method as a callback\n* Existing modules with inline data should be refactored to use the interface and trait for consistency.\n\n## Implementation Brief\n\n* [x] Add new interface `includes/Core/Modules/Module_With_Inline_Data.php` \n  *  It should enforce `get_inline_data` method which should return an array\n* [x] Add new trait `includes/Core/Modules/Module_With_Inline_Data_Trait.php`\n  * Include  `register_inline_data` method which hooks into the `googlesitekit_inline_modules_data` and uses `get_inline_data` as a callback\n* [x] Update following modules: \n  * `includes/Modules/Analytics_4.php`\n  * `includes/Modules/Ads.php`\n  * `includes/Modules/Sign_In_With_Google.php`\n    * Each should implement `Module_With_Inline_Data` interface and use `Module_With_Inline_Data_Trait` trait\n    * Refactor existing callback for `googlesitekit_inline_modules_data` hook to use new method `get_inline_data`\n    * In the `register` method, invoke `register_inline_data`\n* Search through codebase if any new module was added in the meantime which is also using the inline data, after this IB was written\n\n### Test Coverage\n\n* Update tests for updated modules to adapt the new method name usage\n\n## QA Brief (QA:ENG)\n\n* Set up Site Kit with Analytics and Ads enabled.\n* Go to the Site Kit page.\n* Type `_googlesitekitModulesData` in the console.\n  * The object should have an `ads` key, whose value is an object containing:\n    * `supportedConversionEvents`: an array of supported conversion events.\n      * As a sanity check, install WooCommerce. This array should contain WooCommerce-related events (`add-to-cart`, `purchase`).\n  * The object should have an `analytics-4` key, whose value is an object containing:\n    * `customDimensionsDataAvailable`\n    * `resourceAvailabilityDates`\n    * `tagIDMismatch`\n    * `newEvents`\n    * `lostEvents`\n    * `newBadgeEvents`\n  * Without setting up Sign In With Google, the object should not have `sign-in-with-google`.\n  * After setting up Sign In With Google, the object should have the `sign-in-with-google` key, whose value is an object containing:\n    * `isWooCommerceActive`\n    * `isWooCommerceRegistrationEnabled`\n\n\n\n\n## Changelog entry\n\n* N/A.\n",

I've assigned it back to you in Execution to add the QAB.", "@techanvil Done! Thanks for letting me know.", "Thanks @abdelmalekkkkk. The PR for the issue is good and I've gone ahead and merged it - congrats on your first merge!\n\nThat said - the current QAB is a bit too broad in scope; there's a lot of functionality associated with the Ads, Analytics and Sign in with Google modules, and QA engineers could spend time smoke testing unnecessary areas (or, more likely would ask you to advise them what they should be focusing on).\n\nTo make the QAB more specific, we should focus on the specific areas of functionality that the refactored code relates to, i.e. the functionality that depends on the pieces of inline data being present.\n\nTo identify these areas, I'd suggest searching for GitHub issues which mention the data keys, e.g. searching for [`supportedConversionEvents`](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Agoogle%2Fsite-kit-wp+supportedConversionEvents&type=issues), and use these issues and their QABs for smoke testing suggestions. Alternatively, use IDE tooling to help identify PRs and their linked issues (for example I use GitLens in Cursor/VS Code, although this [doesn't seem available](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZedEditor/comments/1b5q3dl/switched_to_zed_and_missing_gitlens/) for Zed).\n\nSimply linking to these issues with the direction to run through their QABs should suffice, rather than reproducing the QABs in this issue.\n\nThis is admittedly a bit fiddly as, despite the refactor itself being pretty straightforward, giving it a proper test means delving into some complex areas of functionality. Please feel free to reach out to me if you need any help with this.", "Thanks for the input @techanvil \n\nI figured it would be way more efficient to make this a QA ENG and just have the engineer make sure the inline module data is populated correctly with a simple console check, instead of having a QA try out all the different places that those pieces of inline data are used. I updated the QA brief accordingly.  Please let me know your thoughts.", "Thanks @abdelmalekkkkk. Great work digging in on this one.\n\nMaking this a `QA:Eng` brief sounds sensible. The QAB you've drafted looks good, it just needs a bit of reformatting. We don't tend to use checkboxes for the QABs, I'd suggest sticking to bullet points, and some of the keys need to be wrapped in backticks. There are also a couple of minor grammatical points to address - as a shortcut, you can ask [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) to review the content, for example you could use this prompt:\n\n```\nReview the following for grammar:\n\n* [ ] Setup Site Kit with Analytics and Ads enabled\n* [ ] Go to the Site Kit page\n* [ ] Type?? `_googlesitekitModulesData` in the console\n\t* [ ] The object should have a `ads` key whose value is an object containing\n\t\t* [ ] supportedConversionEvents: array of supported conversion events\n\t\t\t* [ ] As a sanity check, install WooCommerce. This array should contain WooCommerce related events (`add-to-cart`, `purchase`)\n\t* [ ] The object should have `analytics-4` key whose value is an object containing\n\t\t* [ ] customDimensionsDataAvailable\n\t\t* [ ] resourceAvailabilityDates\n\t\t* [ ] tagIDMismatch\n\t\t* [ ] newEvents\n\t\t* [ ] lostEvents\n\t\t* [ ] newBadgeEvents\n\t* [ ] Without setting up Sign In With Google, the object should not have `sign-in-with-google`\n\t* [ ] With Sign In With Google setup, the object should have the `sign-in-with-google` and its value should be an object containing\n\t\t* [ ] isWooCommerceActive\n\t\t* [ ] isWooCommerceRegistrationEnabled\n```\n\nOnce it's tidied up, this should be good to go!", "@techanvil Done!", "Thanks @abdelmalekkkkk, that's great.

After analyzing the codebase, the `are_site_fields_synced` method appears to be unused in production code and is only referenced in test files. Additionally, the `fetch_site_fields` method is only used internally by the unused `are_site_fields_synced` method, making it a candidate for removal as well.\n\nThis cleanup will streamline the Google_Proxy class by removing dead code that is no longer needed, reducing the maintenance burden and potential confusion for developers working with the authentication system.\n\n---------------\n\n_Do not alter or remove anything below.

      "comments" : [ "(draft)\r\n\r\nThere are currently three options for using rope in Vim:\r\n\r\n- ropevim is the reference implementation maintained by the rope project. Though there are some rough edges in the UI, it's one of the more fully featured rope integration. The way this plug-in is designed and implemented, it doesn't actually need that much maintenance, so its sparse update rate can be quite misleading.\r\n- python-mode is the one that I personally use and have used for a long time. It does include many other tools other than just refactoring with rope, and it doesn't support all of rope's feature and options but the ones that it does implement works very well, and I also occasionally work on that project to improve its rope support as well.\r\n- Palantir Python LSP. There are two iterationsof this project, the Palantir version of this LSP project (`pyls`, [GitHub](https://github.com/palantir/)) seems to be dead, but a community fork (`pylsp`, [GitHub](https://github.com/python-lsp/python-lsp-server)) ran by Palantir's former maintainers is still alive and kicking. I recommend using the community fork instead of the original Palantir one. I don't really use this LSP that much at the moment, but one way or the other it'll likely be a cornerstone of rope's future in the LSP space.\r\n\r\nThere's also a potential forth option:\r\n\r\n- [rope-language-server](https://github.com/mcepl/rope-language-server) is an experimental fork of Palantir's LSP by one of rope's own main maintainer. This project is not ready for prime time yet and is currently on hold. Not recommended for use.", ">     * [rope-language-server](https://github.com/mcepl/rope-language-server) is a fork of Palantir's LSP by one of rope's own main maintainer. This project is not ready for prime time yet and is currently on hold.\r\n\r\nAnd currently is dead. I can transfer it to the `python-rope` if you care about it, but I don't think it is worthy: it is not much more than a small fork of the original rather old commit of the Palantir Python LSP, with some non-rope functionality removed and replaced by rope, but really not that many. I think it would be nice if something like that was written, but I am not sure this is it.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, I think that LSP is the future, and if rope wants to survive, it should be fully used by some LSP servers (???fully??? meaning not just used for few refactoring functions before the LSP server gets better implementation, but used for everything rope is providing).", "After evaluating the landscape of LSP; currently, I think our best bet for moving into LSP space is by creating a python-lsp-server plug-in rather than forking python-language-server or python-lsp-server itself, the way that rope-language-server was doing. python-lsp-server has a plugin system that would allow 3rd party plugins to hook new functionalities into python-lsp-server.\r\n\r\npython-lsp-server already has a first party rope plugin, but, as you said, it barely scratches the surface of rope's refactoring functionality. Currently, it only seem to provide renaming and completion. \r\n\r\nWe'll need it to implement more functionalities into it or create a third party rope plugin for python-lsp-server to make rope a more viable/competitive option there.", "Yes, but I was really thinking about more of rope even into the fundamental operations (`go-to-definition`), and ideally to make it so that the model of the document which is in memory **IS** the rope???s one. However, I won???t be writing this, so whatever whoever decides is their problem. `rope-language-server` is dead then.", "Personally, I'm happy to let users decide if they want to mix and match pylsp plugins. If they want to use Jedi for completion and definition jumping, but rope for refactoring, then they should be allowed to have that choice, rather than being forced to choose between jedi-only LS and rope-only LS.\r\n\r\nRope's core strength is refactoring operations, so that's where I want to focus my development effort, at least until we have a larger number of active contributors/maintainers to support the capacity to look after the other parts of Rope.\r\n\r\nThe way I see it, our real competition here isn't other open source tooling like Jedi or isort, even when there are definitely some (or a lot) of overlaps between these projects, but rather closed source language servers like Pylance or PyCharm.", "If `pylsp` allows this level of granularity, than good for us. Otherwise, all good points. And concerning the competitive scene, I would say https://github.com/Microsoft/python-language-server is somewhere on the top of the list.", "`pylsp` has some pretty serious issues which makes it somewhat unusable in a lot of contexts:\nhttps://github.com/python-lsp/python-lsp-server/issues/114\nhttps://github.com/python-lsp/python-lsp-server/issues/625\nhttps://github.com/python-lsp/python-lsp-server/issues/503\n\nI think in general, having separate LSs makes a lot of sense and having a dedicated rope LS would be valuable. It's not forcing people to choose between jedi-only and rope-only, but rather that jedi LS would provide the syntax highlighting, go to symbol, etc support, and rope LS could enrich the developer experience by offering additional code actions for refactoring.\n\nThis is the direction `ruff` has started moving in" ],

Currently, the Norwegian Nynorsk translation may be incomplete or outdated compared to the English version.\r\n\r\n### Steps to resolve\r\n1. Compare the contents of `src/gui/src/i18n/translations/en.js` and `src/gui/src/i18n/translations/nn.js`\r\n2. For each translation key in `en.js`, ensure a corresponding translation exists in `nn.js`\r\n3. If a translation is missing in `nn.js`, add it with an appropriate Norwegian Nynorsk translation\r\n4. If any translations in `nn.js` are outdated or incorrect, update them to match the current English version\r\n\r\n### Additional notes\r\n- Please ensure that the translations are culturally appropriate and maintain the intended meaning of the English text\r\n- If certain terms or phrases don't have a direct Norwegian Nynorsk equivalent, consider adding translator notes or using transliteration where appropriate\r\n\r\n### Files to be updated\r\n- `src/gui/src/i18n/translations/nn.js`\r\n\r\n### Related files\r\n- `src/gui/src/i18n/translations/en.js` (reference file)\r\n\r\nThank you for helping to improve the Norwegian Nynorsk localization of our project!\r\n",

The problem is that Airflow logs errors when a variable is not found, even if a default is provided.\n\nIn our use case, we have 100+ DAGs and use variables to configure schedules for them, so variables are read during DAG loading. This leads to significant error log spam that is picked up by Sentry. It's possible to work around this with custom logging filters, but I believe using the error log level is suboptimal and should be changed in Airflow core, especially considering `Variable.get` supports the \"default\" kwarg.\n\n### Related issues\n\n_No response_\n\n### Are you willing to submit a PR?\n\n- [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n",
