Set up Dify 1.7.0 using Docker Compose\n2. Create a new workflow application\n3. Add a Question Classifier node to the workflow\n4. Configure the Question Classifier node with:\n   - Input variable selector\n   - Model configuration\n   - Classification classes\n5. Start workflow preview/run\n6. While the Question Classifier node is in \"RUNNING\" status, immediately click on the node\n7. Error occurs\n\n### ?????? Expected Behavior\n\nThe Question Classifier node panel should open normally, allowing users to view node configuration and status even during execution.\n\n### ??? Actual Behavior\n\nClicking on the Question Classifier node during workflow execution results in a JavaScript error and the UI becomes unresponsive. The workflow continues to run in the background, but the frontend crashes.\n\n<img width=\"1241\" height=\"640\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72926a4e-8489-45ae-8212-2480cbfa425d\" />\n\n<img width=\"390\" height=\"345\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9647076-6ebe-4bff-bfd0-80ed045ea78d\" />",

I'm [Dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot) and I???m helping the dify team.\n\n<!-- Answer -->\nThis error is likely caused by missing null/undefined checks in the frontend code for the Question Classifier node panel. When you click the node during execution, the required state or data may not be available yet, leading to a crash if the component tries to access properties of a null object. This pattern has been seen in other Dify issues and is often resolved by adding robust null guards and error handling in the relevant React components to prevent the UI from crashing if data is missing or in transition ([example](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/16142), [example](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/16173)).\n\nRecent pull requests have improved variable validation and error handling for workflow nodes, but there???s no direct evidence this specific bug is fixed in 1.7.0. Upgrading to the latest version may help, as changes like [#21766](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/21766), [#21932](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/21932), and [#22462](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/22462) have touched related areas. If upgrading isn???t possible, a workaround is to add null checks in the Question Classifier node???s panel/component rendering logic (see `web/app/components/workflow/nodes/_base/components/workflow-panel/index.tsx`) to ensure the UI doesn???t try to access properties of a null object during rapid state changes.\n\nIf you have custom modifications, double-check that all node data is initialized before rendering, and consider adding fallback UI or error messages when required data is missing ([reference](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/20725)).\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

These must be filed via the bug report template.\n- [x] I have looked through the open issues for a duplicate request.\n\n### What's the problem this feature will solve?\n\nThe `timeout-minutes` property can be used to prevent run-away jobs from consuming all your allowed GitHub Actions runner minutes. [The default value is 360 minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idtimeout-minutes) (6 hours).\n\nExamples include scripts that accidentally hang or go into a loop, package managers which slow to a crawl when the registry is responding slowly, compilers that get stuck, or really anything else that can unexpectedly slow but not be constrained by its own timeout.\n\nI use this property on all jobs in all my workflows.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nI would like Zizmor to enforce or recommend the use of a `timeout-minutes` property on all jobs. This property is not strictly related to security, but I think it's such a useful configuration that it could be part of the \"pedantic\" or \"auditor\" persona.\n\nAt a stretch, you could suggest that a vulnerability in a workflow could allow an attacker to consume all your GitHub Actions minutes, and this would protect against that, but honestly it's more likely that `npm install` hangs and eats all your allowance.\n\n### Additional context\n\nJobs which call a reusable workflow (with `uses`) do not support `timeout-minutes`. The property needs to be defined in the jobs within the reusable workflow that it calls.",

Which one is more important probably ends up being context- and trigger-sensitive.)", "Hey @woodruffw , @johnbillion,\nI'd like to work on this issue. \nI'm relatively new to contributing to Python projects but have experience with CI/CD workflows and GitHub Actions. \nCould you point me to any existing checks that would be good examples to follow for implementing this feature?", "Hi @EmmanuelBerkowicz, thanks for offering your time.\n\nThis is a Rust project, not a Python project, just so you know \uD83D\uDE09 \n\n> Could you point me to any existing checks that would be good examples to follow for implementing this feature?\n\nAny of the pre-existing audits that use `audit_normal_job` would probably be a pretty good reference point -- see `UnpinnedImages` for example:\n\nhttps://github.com/zizmorcore/zizmor/blob/22958cba7586b81790213b908f23bf86f092d834/crates/zizmor/src/audit/unpinned_images.rs#L49\n\n(This audit _should_ be simpler than most -- it should be mostly a matter of checking `timeout_minutes` on each job and step, and raising a finding if any is missing or if the step(s) aren't transitively covered by the job.)\n\nThe docs here should also help a bit, although they're also a bit stale: https://docs.zizmor.sh/development/#adding-or-modifying-an-audit\n", "@woodruffw ,\nI knew that....

Any recommendation or guide  to  build all dependencies needed like java client and more, Im' having hard time to build the project since is asking me to some files .yml like `notexist`", "@SalvadorRomo https://openlineage.io/docs/development/developing/spark/setup/ -> this should help. \nThe script to build all deps is: \n```\n./buildDependencies.sh\n```", "thks! I could build it. Btw, do you know how can i change the spark version in test to version 4? I would appreciate it thks ", "@SalvadorRomo for example\n```\n./gradlew --no-daemon --console=plain --stacktrace build check -Pspark.version=4.0.0 -Pscala.binary.version=2.13 -Pjava.compile.home=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/zulu-17.jdk/Contents/Home\n```", "Hey thks, could change the version, but  now im facing another issue, do you know how to builld the project to run with scala 2.13 and spark 4,  tried your command  but seems its still using olde  binary  version look :\n\n<img width=\"1164\" height=\"132\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/267b7c02-cefb-44bc-98a2-ec15f212ffb3\" />\n\nBecause of this, its kind of  tricky know the correct version of each signature method. For example ` Transform `  has been remove in newer version of spark-sql, and the depenendency for that older version is still there.  I noticed there are lots of ` sparkXX` but not sure  how to get the correct dependencies for spark4 and scala 2.13", "Hey nvm, it was my IDE issue all the time. \n\nUPDATE: well I think that is the issue you had with Spark4, right?, because besides making my IDE to pick correct version of jars, it stills fail with the same issue, or maybe am i doing something wrong? if yes, any recommendation? I have so far tried to invalidate cache to make my IDE to pick correct  jars, rebuild project and more. If you have any recommendation that is not in the docs, please let me know. ", "@pawel-big-lebowski @mobuchowski  Btw, one thing i noticed is that by trying to enable different spark versions into the same  source code wouldn't be  scalable at all, bucease as spark continue to release new versions; signatures, class paths and more  will change over time, and maybe reflection won't be  suitable anymore.  For now this change work but to overcome this in the future, you would want to create different integration projects for every spark versions whose classes, classpath are alike. or even better if possile, some automation tests that grabs yours jars  and run raw scala scripts for differents  sparks versions;  maybe with cucumber. This is just a humble opinion , hope it is useful.", "I think the current option - with separate visitors for each Spark version if they diverge - has been working well enough for now. We have tests that run with every supported Spark version. If anything, the problem is with low coverage in some cases in general. That's also just my opinion :)\n", "Yeah you are right!! Didn't see it that way. Thks" ],

", "Thank you for contributing :)", "@EzicStar I'm rather new to CS (in the middle of a slow career change) and this is the first time I've worked in this large of a codebase. I thought perhaps asking a few questions now would use less of your time than submitting a bad PR. I know you could probably tackle this issue quite quickly, so thank you for the opportunity to learn while working on it.\n\nI have a few ideas of where the right place to raise the error might be, if I understood the issue correctly. I've implemented Option 1 (see below), but I need a good way to test it. Would you like me to add a test to test_models.py or create a new test file? I'll probably work on creating a test while I wait to hear back.\n\n### Option 1\nRaise the error in `slide_to_patient_from_slide_table_`  within the file `src/stamp/modeling/data.py`. Specifically after line 476 before the line that starts with `slide_to_patient` we can check if within the filename_label column there is a string with a .h5 at the end. If not, we raise a value error. I think this would raise the error early enough to avoid unneeded work. The other two options that I see have the program do more work before checking for the .h5 extension.\n\n### Option 2\nAt the end of that same function (`slide_to_patient_from_slide_table_`), we could check the slide_to_patient's feature path. But why go through the trouble of mapping first?\n\n### Option 3\nIn crossval.py, deply.py, and train.py (all within src/stamp/modeling) after creating the `slide_to_patient` the code could check the FeaturePath for .h5 extensions. At the moment I think this is the worst option not only because of the duplication of code, but because more computation will occur before the lack of a .h5 extension is discovered. \n\nIf I missed an option or misinterpreted the error please let me know.\n\nThanks!" ],

      "description" : "### Is your feature request related to a problem?\n\n- [x] Yes, it is related to a problem\n\n### Describe the feature you'd like\n\n### \uD83C\uDF1F Feature Description\n\nThis feature focuses on a critical enhancement of the initial **Classification Prompt**. The goal is to refine the prompt's logic to be much stricter and more precise, ensuring that the DevRel agent is only triggered for queries that are explicitly its responsibility. This involves improving the instructions the LLM uses to decide whether a message requires agent intervention.\n\nAdditionally, this task includes a secondary objective to review all other existing prompts (`agent_prompt`, `summarization_prompt`, etc.) for clarity, efficiency, and alignment with the latest system architecture.\n\n### \uD83D\uDD0D Problem Statement\n\nCurrently, the classification prompt may be too broad, leading to the DevRel agent responding to general conversations or messages where it's not needed. This can create several issues:\n\n1.  **Unnecessary Invocations**: The agent wastes resources processing irrelevant messages.\n2.  **User Annoyance**: An AI assistant that injects itself into every conversation can be perceived as intrusive or unhelpful.\n3.  **Lack of Precision**: The agent may misinterpret context and provide answers when it should remain silent, degrading the quality of the user experience.\n\nThe core problem is a lack of **strict activation boundaries** for the agent.\n\n### \uD83C\uDFAF Expected Outcome\n\n1.  **Modified Classification Prompt**: The `Classification Prompt` will be rewritten to include new, strict rules. The agent should **only** be activated if one of the following conditions is met:\n      * The user **explicitly tags or mentions** the DevRel AI bot (e.g., `@Devr.AI, can you help?`).\n      * The user's query is a direct question about the project, community, contribution process, or a technical issue clearly related to the repository (e.g., \"How do I set up the development environment?\", \"I'm getting a build error.\").\n      * The prompt will explicitly instruct the model to **ignore** general chatter, greetings, and conversations between other users unless the bot is tagged.\n2.  **Reduced False Positives**: After implementation, there should be a measurable decrease in the number of times the agent responds to irrelevant conversations.\n3.  **Improved Prompt Suite**: A brief review of all other system prompts will be conducted, with minor enhancements made for clarity and conciseness.\n\n### Record\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\n- [ ] I want to work on implementing this feature",

      "description" : "###  Feature Request: Chatbot Integration in Brevity\n\n**Goal**\nDevelop a smart chatbot inside the Brevity app that allows users to:\n- Ask for summaries or explanations of articles\n- Clarify news topics (fact-checking assistance)\n- Engage in basic conversation for better news understanding\n\n---\n\n**Proposed Approach**\n- Use **Gemini API** or **OpenAI GPT-4 API** as the backend brain\n- Create a new screen or floating chatbot UI (like a chat bubble)\n- If needed, add a backend Firebase Function (or prepare for future Node.js use)\n\n---\n\n**User Flow**\n1. User taps on a chat icon in the app\n2. A modal/chat screen opens\n3. User types a question or news-related prompt\n4. Chatbot responds using the Gemini API\n5. Past conversations can optionally be stored locally or in Firestore\n\n---\n\n**Tech Stack**\n- Dart / Flutter\n- flutter_bloc for state management\n- Gemini API via HTTP\n\n---\n\n**UI Ideas**\n- Floating Action Button ??? Chat Overlay\n- Chat bubble layout (like WhatsApp/Messenger)\n- Show loading shimmer while bot \"thinks\"\n- Support image/news link previews in chat\n\n---\n\n**Why Me?**\nI'm a GSSoC contributor excited about Flutter, NLP, and building helpful AI tools. I'd love to implement the first version of this chatbot and iterate based on mentor feedback.\n\nPlease assign this issue to me.\n",

      "url" : "https://github.com/odoo/paper-muncher/issues/72",
      "repositoryName" : "odoo/paper-muncher",
      "description" : "Hello paper-muncher team,\n\nI am attempting to compile paper-muncher on a FreeBSD 14.2 system. I understand this is an experimental project and FreeBSD is not an officially supported target, but I wanted to document the journey and the final blockers in the hope that it might be useful for a future porting effort or for anyone else attempting this.\n\nAfter overcoming several dependency and build configuration hurdles, the process now fails during C++ compilation. This suggests the main remaining issues are within the C++ source code itself, primarily in the karm dependency, which seems to use modern C++ features that are not fully compatible with the Clang 18 toolchain on FreeBSD.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the steps taken, the workarounds required, and the final compilation errors.\nSystem Environment\n\n    Operating System: FreeBSD 14.2-RELEASE\n\n    Compiler: Clang 18.1.8 (installed via pkg install llvm18)\n\n    Core Dependencies Installed: python312, ninja, jq, oniguruma\n\nSummary of Porting Steps & Workarounds\n\nTo get the build process to the point of C++ compilation, the following issues had to be addressed:\n\n1. Core Dependencies\nThe following packages were required but are not explicitly listed for a FreeBSD environment:\n\n    python312\n\n    ninja\n\n    jq (for the cxx-collect rule)\n\n    The full llvm18 toolchain to provide clang-scan-deps and other utilities.\n\n2. Build System Configuration (cutekit)\nThe cutekit build system correctly identifies the OS as freebsd but has no rules to handle it, causing it to fail when resolving dependencies for system-specific implementations. I manually patched the following manifest.json files within the .cutekit/extern/ directory to include \"freebsd\" in their when.sys arrays:\n\n      \n// Patched the following manifest.json files to include \"freebsd\":\n\n// 1. To enable the base POSIX layer\n.cutekit/extern/skift-org/karm/src/impls/impl-posix/manifest.json\n\n// 2. To enable kevent async I/O (same as Darwin).\n.cutekit/extern/skift-org/karm/src/impls/impl-posix/kevent/manifest.json\n\n// 3. To satisfy the sandbox dependency (best-effort hack, as FreeBSD has Capsicum).\n.cutekit/extern/skift-org/karm/src/impls/impl-posix/darwin/manifest.json\n\n\n3. Hardcoded Compiler Flags\nThe build process generates commands with compiler flags that are incompatible with clang18 on FreeBSD. These flags appear to be dynamically generated by the build scripts, as they could not be found via grep in any source configuration files (project.json, mixins.py, etc.).\n\nThe problematic flags were:\n\n    -fmodules-reduced-bmi (unknown argument)\n\n    -std=gnu2y (invalid value)\n\nTo overcome this, a compiler wrapper script was created. This script intercepts calls to clang, clang++, and clang-scan-deps. It filters the arguments, removing -fmodules-reduced-bmi and replacing -std=gnu2y with -std=gnu17 before passing them to the real compiler. This was the only method that proved successful at correcting the dynamically generated build commands.\nFinal C++ Compilation Errors\n\nAfter implementing all the above workarounds, the build process starts and successfully compiles a significant number of files ([94/386]). However, it ultimately fails with a cascade of C++ errors originating from the karm library dependency.\n\nThe errors suggest a deep incompatibility related to modern C++ features, particularly constexpr, consteval, and advanced template metaprogramming, which the FreeBSD Clang version cannot handle as expected.\n<details>\n<summary><b>Click to expand the full compiler output</b></summary>\n\n      \n[43/292] host-amd64/vaev-css: cxx .cutekit/build/host-amd64-c77a6ee6-7ffb5091/vaev-css/__obj__/parser.cpp.o...\nFAILED: .cutekit/build/host-amd64-c77a6ee6-7ffb5091/vaev-css/__obj__/parser.cpp.o \n/usr/local/bin/clang++ -MD -MF .cutekit/build/host-amd64-c77a6ee6-7ffb5091/vaev-css/__obj__/parser.cpp.o.d -std=gnu++2c -Wall -Wextra -Werror -fcolor-diagnostics -fmodules-reduced-bmi -O3 -I.cutekit/extern/cute-engineering -I.cutekit/extern/cute-engineering/ce-libc/src -I.cutekit/extern/cute-engineering/ce-libm/src -I.cutekit/extern/cute-engineering/ce-mdi/src -I.cutekit/extern/cute-engineering/ce-stdcpp/src -I.cutekit/extern/skift-org/karm/src/assets -I.cutekit/extern/skift-org/karm/src/impls -I.cutekit/extern/skift-org/karm/src/libs -I.cutekit/generated -I.cutekit/generated/__aliases__ -Isrc -D__ck_abi_unknown__ -D__ck_abi_value=unknown -D__ck_arch_amd64__ -D__ck_arch_value=amd64 -D__ck_bits_unknown__ -D__ck_bits_value=unknown -D__ck_host__ -D__ck_sys_encoding_utf8__ -D__ck_sys_encoding_value=utf8 -D__ck_sys_freebsd__ -D__ck_sys_line_ending_lf__ -D__ck_sys_line_ending_value=lf -D__ck_sys_path_separator_slash__ -D__ck_sys_path_separator_value=slash -D__ck_sys_terminal_ansi__ -D__ck_sys_terminal_value=ansi -D__ck_sys_value=freebsd -D__ck_toolchain_clang__ -D__ck_toolchain_value=clang -D__ck_version_v0_2_2__ -D__ck_version_value=v0.2.2 @.cutekit/build/host-amd64-c77a6ee6-7ffb5091/vaev-css/__obj__/parser.cpp.o.modmap -c -o .cutekit/build/host-amd64-c77a6ee6-7ffb5091/vaev-css/__obj__/parser.cpp.o src/vaev-css/parser.cpp\nIn file included from src/vaev-css/parser.cpp:1:\nIn file included from .cutekit/extern/skift-org/karm/src/libs/karm-logger/logger.h:3:\nIn file included from .cutekit/extern/skift-org/karm/src/libs/karm-base/loc.h:3:\n.cutekit/extern/skift-org/karm/src/libs/karm-base/string.h:370:42: error: constexpr function never produces a constant expression [-Winvalid-constexpr]\n  370 | inline constexpr Karm::_Str<Karm::Utf16> operator\"\"_s16(char16_t const* buf, usize len) {\n      |                                          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n.cutekit/extern/skift-org/karm/src/libs/karm-base/string.h:371:13: note: reinterpret_cast is not allowed in a constant expression\n  371 |     return {reinterpret_cast<u16 const*>(buf), len};\n      |             ^\nIn file included from src/vaev-css/parser.cpp:1:\nIn file included from .cutekit/extern/skift-org/karm/src/libs/karm-logger/logger.h:4:\nIn file included from .cutekit/extern/skift-org/karm/src/libs/karm-cli/style.h:3:\nIn file included from .cutekit/extern/skift-org/karm/src/libs/karm-io/emit.h:4:\nIn file included from .cutekit/extern/skift-org/karm/src/libs/karm-io/fmt.h:16:\nIn file included from .cutekit/extern/skift-org/karm/src/libs/karm-io/text.h:3:\nIn file included from .cutekit/extern/skift-org/karm/src/libs/karm-io/traits.h:7:\nIn file included from .cutekit/extern/skift-org/karm/src/libs/karm-io/types.h:3:\nIn file included from .cutekit/extern/skift-org/karm/src/libs/karm-base/res.h:4:\nIn file included from .cutekit/extern/skift-org/karm/src/libs/karm-base/union.h:3:\n.cutekit/extern/skift-org/karm/src/libs/karm-meta/pack.h:17:32: error: expected '>'\n   17 |     if constexpr (Same<T, Ts...[Start]>)\n      |                                ^\n.cutekit/extern/skift-org/karm/src/libs/karm-meta/pack.h:17:23: note: to match this '<'\n   17 |     if constexpr (Same<T, Ts...[Start]>)\n      |                       ^\nfatal error: too many errors emitted, stopping now [-ferror-limit=]\n20 errors generated.\nninja: build stopped: subcommand failed.\nError: ninja: Process exited with code 1\n</details>\nConclusion\n\nIt appears that successfully compiling on FreeBSD would require:\n\n    Official Build System Support: Adding freebsd as a recognized target in the build configuration files and implementing a proper sandbox mechanism (e.g., using Capsicum).\n\n    C++ Code Portability: A significant review of the C++ code, especially within the karm dependency, to resolve incompatibilities with the Clang 18 toolchain or to remove/replace language features that are not yet universally supported.\n\nI hope this detailed report is useful.

      "url" : "https://github.com/AOSSIE-Org/Devr.AI/issues/97",
      "repositoryName" : "AOSSIE-Org/Devr.AI",
      "description" : "### Is your feature request related to a problem?\n\n- [x] Yes, it is related to a problem\n\n### Describe the feature you'd like\n\n## \uD83C\uDF1F Feature Description\n\nThis feature re-envisions the **`FAQ Handler`** as a specialized tool that leverages web search to answer general, high-level questions about the organization. It is designed to be the go-to tool for users seeking to understand the organization's mission, projects, and operational model.\n\nIt will be triggered when users ask questions like:\n\n  * *\"What is this organization all about?\"*\n  * *\"How does this organization work?\"*\n  * *\"What projects do you have?\"*\n  * *\"What are the main goals of Devr.AI?\"*\n\n## \uD83D\uDD0D Problem Statement\n\nNewcomers and potential contributors often have foundational questions about the organization itself before they dive into specific projects. Answering these questions manually is repetitive and inefficient. While a static knowledge base could work, it risks becoming outdated. A dynamic approach is needed to provide accurate, current information based on the organization's official public presence.\n\n## \uD83C\uDFAF Expected Outcome\n\nThe `FAQ Handler` will act as an automated public-facing representative, providing instant and accurate information about the organization. The expected outcome is a system that can:\n\n  * **Receive a general query** about the organization.\n  * **Dynamically search the web**, focusing on the organization's official website, blog, and public repositories.\n  * **Synthesize the search results** into a concise, easy-to-understand answer.\n  * **Provide source links** to allow users to explore the topic further.\n\n## \uD83D\uDCF7 Screenshots and Design Ideas\n\nThe workflow will be managed by the `FAQ Handler` tool, which will essentially be a specialized and intelligent implementation of a web search node.\n\n1.  **Trigger**: A user asks a general question.\n      * *User*: \"What kind of projects does this organization work on?\"\n2.  **Input**: The user's query is passed to the `FAQ Handler`.\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"query\": \"What projects does this organization have?\"\n    }\n    ```\n3.  **Action - Intelligent Web Search**:\n      * The tool formulates targeted search queries. For the example above, it would generate queries like:\n          * `\"Devr.AI open source projects\"`\n          * `\"Devr.AI GitHub repositories\"`\n          * `\"About Devr.AI projects\"`\n      * It executes these queries using the **Web Search Tool**.\n4.  **Synthesis**:\n      * The tool receives the top search results (snippets and URLs).\n      * It feeds this context to the LLM (Gemini) with a prompt like: *\"Based on the following search results, answer the user's question: 'What projects does this organization have?'\"*\n5.  **Output**: The tool returns a structured response containing the synthesized answer and the sources used.\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"status\": \"success\",\n      \"answer\": \"Devr.AI primarily focuses on creating tools for developer relations (DevRel), including AI-powered assistants for community engagement, issue triage, and onboarding. You can explore our main projects on our official website and GitHub page.\",\n      \"sources\": [\n        { \"title\": \"Devr.AI - Official Website\", \"url\": \"https://devr.ai/projects\" },\n        { \"title\": \"Devr.AI on GitHub\", \"url\": \"https://github.com/AOSSIE-Org/Devr.AI\" }\n      ]\n    }\n    ```\n6.  **Final Action**: The DevRel Agent formats this into a helpful message and sends it to the user.\n\n## \uD83D\uDCCB Additional Context\n\nBy aligning the **`FAQ Handler`** with the **Web Search** tool, we ensure a \"single source of truth\": the organization's own website and public materials. This approach is highly scalable and low-maintenance.\n\nTo make this tool effective, the primary task is not to build a database of FAQs, but to ensure that the organization's **website is well-structured and contains clear, findable answers** to these common questions. The success of the `FAQ Handler` is directly tied to the quality of the organization's public-facing content.\n\n### Record\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\n- [ ] I want to work on implementing this feature",

I'll elaborate on my workflow soon.", " **FAQ Handler Implementation:**\n\nI???ve carefully read through the problem statement and I believe this is a high-impact addition to your project.\n\nHere's how I plan to break this down and implement it, step by step:\n\n_Step 1: Question Intent Detection_\n\n- Build a simple NLP classifier (or use keyword-based matching) to determine if the user???s query is a general organizational FAQ (e.g., \"What projects do you have?\" or \"How does Devr.AI work?\").\n\n- This helps trigger the specialized FAQ Handler only for relevant questions.\n\n_Step 2: Dynamic Web Search Tool_\n\n- Use a web search API like:\n\n1. [SerpAPI](https://serpapi.com/) (Google/Bing wrapper),\n2. or DuckDuckGo Search API (open/free).\n\n- Fetch top 3???5 results focused on official sources.\n\n _Step 3: AI-Powered Synthesis_\n\n- Feed the top search results (title, snippet, URL) into an LLM like OpenAI GPT or Gemini using a structured prompt.\n\n- Example prompt:\n\n\"Based on the following search results, answer this user question in a concise and helpful way: 'What projects does Devr.AI work on?'\"\n\n_Step 4: Generate Final Response_\n\n- Parse the LLM output to:\n\n1. Return a clear, user-friendly answer.\n2.

Write a brief description of how you will approach the task (without using ChatGPT).\n3. Add your Telegram handler in your application (e.g., in OnlyDust or similar)\n4. Write ETA in your application\n\n\n\n## What should I do if I have a problem\n1. Try to google it before asking. Googling is taking major part of dev work \n2. If you couldn't find answer your question with Google, text your question to [dev](https://t.me/spotnet_dev/4) group with your question.\n3. Do not send DM to maintainer, it would be better and faster to ask other contributors in chat \n\n\n## How to prepare PR\n1. Check if your code [smell](https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/smells) good\n2. Add `close #<issue number>` to link your issue with your PR\n3. Do not commit changes that are unrelated to your task\n4. Check after you created PR, if you committed everything\n\n\n## Task Description\n1. **Update Endpoint Behavior**  \n   Refactor the `/admin/me` endpoint to return the currently authenticated admin's data.  \n   It should:\n   - Rely on the authentication token to identify the admin\n   - Return relevant admin fields (e.g. `id`, `email`, `is_super_admin`)\n   - Exclude sensitive data such as password hashes\n\n2. **Ensure Secure Access**  \n   Make sure the route is protected and only accessible to authenticated admin users.\n\n3. **Update Response Schema**  \n   Use a clear and secure response model to structure the output.\n\n4. **Write Tests**  \n   Add tests for:\n   - Authenticated access\n   - Unauthorized access\n   - Correct data structure\n\n5. **Verify CI Workflow**  \n   Ensure all tests pass and the workflow remains green.",

So if had results and switch out of the app or i receive the lock screen of my phone, the app triggers a re-search of the already found results. This is realy anoying and in my oppinion a bug. \n\nI think a full re-search shoul'd only be applied when i scroll up. I mean scroll down also triggers the search to add the next results of my hashtag search. Because when this re-search is triggered it starts completly from the beginning. so i need to scroll down again until i reach the part of my search which i don't looked into. \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Search a Hashtag\n2. See Results and Scroll Down\n3. Wait for Lock Screen of Phone or Switch shortly to another App (ex. Email)\n4.

Here???s my high-level plan:\n\n1. **Interface scaffolding**  \n   - Pull the exact `NFTContractInterface`, `JobContractInterface`, etc. from Issues #440 & #441.  \n   - Generate TS stubs for each contract method & event signature.\n\n2. **Mock implementations**  \n   - For each contract interface, create a `MockXyzContract` class that simulates state in-memory (e.g. `Map<???>`).  \n   - Implement all methods with realistic return types, incrementing IDs or toggling states as needed.  \n   - Include optional IPFS-style metadata where applicable.\n\n3. **Configurable delays & errors**  \n   - Add a shared `MockConfig` where teams can set per-contract or per-method delays (in ms) and error rates.  \n   - Wrap methods in a helper that injects `await sleep(config.delay)` and randomly throws when `config.errorRate > 0`.\n\n4. **Dockerized local server**  \n   - Spin up an Express (or Fastify) HTTP+JSON-RPC server exposing each mock contract under distinct endpoints (e.g. `/mock/nft/mint`).  \n   - Write a `Dockerfile` that installs dependencies, builds TS, and starts the mock server.  \n   - Expose ports & volume-mount docs for easy local use.\n\n5. **Documentation & examples**  \n   - Add a `README.md` with:\n     - Installation via `docker build` + `docker run`\n     - Environment variables or JSON config format\n     - Sample TS code showing how to `import { MockNFTContract }` or call the Docker-based RPC.  \n   - Provide a small `example/` folder with a Next.js or Node script that mints a token, polls for events, and demonstrates error injection.\n\n6. **Testing**  \n   - Write unit tests (Jest) to assert that each mock follows its interface and respects delays/errors.  \n   - Add a CI step in `mock/` that runs these tests.\n\nI???ll follow the project???s CONTRIBUTING guidelines, commit under a branch named `mock-contracts-setup`, and open a draft PR once I???ve scaffolded the first two mocks. Please assign this issue to me or let me know if there???s any other setup I should follow first.

I think the best bang for buck is asking plugin devs to add annual tags to their repos. Any beets plugin should be tagged with `beets-plugin` (or whatever name we decide) and the current year - `2025`. Github search allows boolean operators so we could just link to plugins as they update.\n\nhttps://github.com/search?q=+%222025%22+AND+%22beets-plugin%22&type=repositories\n\nCurrent state is just an alphabetical sort:\n\nhttps://beets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins/aura.html\n\nWe could sort by stars by default. Unfortunately, alphabetical sort in github searches isn't possible.\n\nhttps://github.com/search?q=%22beets-plugin%22&type=repositories&s=stars&o=desc\n\nIf a developer stops updating a git repo for a year, that's a sign that the plugin is no longer supported. So this method would automatically rank up-to-date plugins higher. Maintenance overhead: one tag per year per repo, and 2 lines of markdown in the docs per year.\n\nHere's how it could look in our docs:\n\n---\n\n# Last Updated: 2026\n\n[Click here](https://github.com/search?q=+%222026%22+AND+%22beets-plugin%22&type=repositories)\n\n# Last Updated: 2025\n\n[Click here](https://github.com/search?q=+%222025%22+AND+%22beets-plugin%22&type=repositories)\n\n# Last Updated: 2024 and earlier\n\nYou can consult our [legacy list of plugins](https://beets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins/aura.html) that have not been updated recently. Some may have overlap with the plugins in the above links.\n\nBecause these plugins are so old, they may not work with current beets.\n\n" ],

      "comments" : [ "<!-- Answer -->\nThis issue happens because the logic for generating node titles during copy/paste is split: top-level nodes use a function that increments the number in the title (like \"Node (1)\", \"Node (2)\"), but child nodes inside iterations use a type-counting approach that doesn't always guarantee unique titles, especially with parallel branches. This can result in duplicate titles when copying complex iterative nodes.\n\nTo fix this, the unique title generation logic (such as the `genNewNodeTitleFromOld` function) needs to be applied recursively to all child nodes during the copy process, not just to the top-level node. You can find the relevant logic in the `handleNodeIterationChildrenCopy` function and related utilities in the workflow codebase. Adjusting this to ensure every copied node gets a unique, incremented title should resolve the duplicate title issue in copied iterations with parallel branches.  \nMore details and code references can be found [here](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/blob/a4ef9009167ed7cf22b0b8bd3a903e8ba0a74567/web/app/components/workflow/hooks/use-nodes-interactions.ts) and [here](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/blob/a4ef9009167ed7cf22b0b8bd3a903e8ba0a74567/web/app/components/workflow/nodes/iteration/use-interactions.ts).\n\nAs of now, there are no documented workarounds or upstream fixes, so updating the recursive copy logic is the recommended approach.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

The current logic for generating node titles during copy doesn't guarantee unique titles for all nodes, especially for parallel branches inside iteration nodes. This leads to duplicate titles, which is not the expected behavior for auto-incrementing node names. The root cause is that top-level nodes use a function that ensures uniqueness, but child nodes inside iterations use a different approach that can result in duplicates. Fixing this would require unifying the title generation logic so every copied node, including children, gets a unique title as expected. You can see the technical details in the code here: [use-nodes-interactions.ts](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/blob/a4ef9009167ed7cf22b0b8bd3a903e8ba0a74567/web/app/components/workflow/hooks/use-nodes-interactions.ts) and [use-interactions.ts](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/blob/a4ef9009167ed7cf22b0b8bd3a903e8ba0a74567/web/app/components/workflow/nodes/iteration/use-interactions.ts).\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

Windows 11 24H2 seems to not have the issue for me.\n\nAre you using Mint 22.1 to research? I have probably used the zoom function (ctrl+up) to make the YouTube pages a little larger. On Windows here it is on 120%. I can check Mint later.", "I'm also experiencing the same issue on Windows 11 24H2. Only happens in Firefox 140.0.4. Chrome version seems to be working fine.", "> I'm also experiencing the same issue on Windows 11 24H2. Only happens in Firefox 140.0.4. Chrome version seems to be working fine.\n\n\nHuh. Mine is fine. Same 24H2 and 140.0.4. I wonder why it's done that to yours on Windows.", "Also having this issue on Brave Brower, Chrome seems ok but who wants to use that ", "Same here, this is happening to me too. It's not just playlist, in the Home tab of a channel, the For You, Videos, etc rows also have this cropped zoomed in view as well. \n\nImprovedTube Version 4.1320\n\nZen browser (Firefox fork) 1.14.5b (Firefox 140.0.4) (64-bit)\n\nWindows 10 22H2\n\n[improvedtube.json](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21333626/improvedtube.json)", "I've noticed the Home page of a channel having the problem, too but only on my Linux. Windows for me is totally fine on Firefox.\n\nThis is weird. Is there anything Zen Browser does to the Firefox options that I have changed manually that could effect it?\n\nI manually change 'browser.enable_automatic_image_resizing' and 'browser.enable_click_image_resizing' in about:config within Firefox every time I have installed it. It is the only things I change in about:config. Maybe I haven't done this on my Linux yet; I have just started using it.\n\nDoes Zen Browser have options for theses toggles within the settings? Or does it come with these already modified?", "Zen has those in about:config. Both of them are true on Zen. I don't tweak any settings directly in about:config though, so I assume that's the default on Zen. I also still have a Firefox install and both of them are true as well. \n\nEdit: I just tried a fresh add-on install on Firefox. Without changing anything, the videos are not stretched. I changed \"Thumbnails per Row\" (General > Thumbnails) to 6, and videos are still not stretched. But importing the same settings from Zen to Firefox produced the bugs. Resetting the settings, the bug isn't produced. ", "Alright. So it must be a setting in our 'Improve YouTube!' addons. Something we changed a while back and is now causing the problem.\n\nI had an old settings backup from 12th October 2024 which I ported over to the Linux installed Firefox. I think it was before the issues with thumbnails. I have exported the Windows settings and had a look at the differences between them.\n\nHere is a list of the differences. The problem must surely be here:\n\n### **These below are new in the .json file. Changes I have made in the Windows version since the last backup, which are not in the Linux version**\n\n\"header_hide_logo\":false,\n\"header_position\":\"normal\",\n\"hide_clip_button\":\"hidden\",\n\"hide_save_button\":\"normal\",\n\"player_autoplay_button\":false,\n\"player_cinema_mode_button\":false,\n\"player_forced_volume\":false,\n\"player_loudness_normalization\":true,\n\"player_popup_button\":false,\n\"player_repeat_button\":false,\n\"player_volume\":9,\n\"remove_member_only\":true,\n\"title_version\":true,\n\n### **These below are the differences in settings that exist in both .json files**\n\n\"hide_share_button\":\"icons_only\", changed to \"hide_share_button\":\"hidden\",\n\"lastDarkTheme\":\"night\", changed to \"lastDarkTheme\":\"sunset\",\n\"lastLightTheme\":\"custom\", changed to \"lastLightTheme\":\"desert\",\n\"player_color\":\"amber\", changed to \"player_color\":\"default\",\n\"theme\":\"night\", changed to \"theme\":\"sunset\",\n\nThis is a good place to start I think.\n\nI also reloaded the old settings to the windows version and all seems to be fine with those settings, too. Which I was hoping would not be the case. Some interaction between settings and browser and OS makes it more complicated to diagnose.", "Ok so I fixed the Linux YouTube Playlists last night.\n\n- First, I backed up my settings from Windows Improve YouTube\n- Went to my broken Linux version\n- Opened Improve YouTube settings and clicked _backup&reset_ > _reset all settings_ \n- Opened a new tab and went to a playlist; it was fixed\n- Then I imported the settings I backed up earlier\n- Opened a new tab and checked the playlist and it still worked fine\n\nIt still worked today after booting up so looks like this fixed it for me.\n\nIf you backup your settings, reset them, then re-import them, checking playlists between each step; it may fix it for you, too.\n\nIf not, try switching to the settings in the last post above, that have changed between both .json files and repeat the steps.\n\nHopefully someone can piece together why first resetting and then re-importing my newer .json file fixed this weirdness.\nIf just saving, resetting, re-importing fixes others' playlists, we can rule out the change in settings between backups at least.", "I'm experiencing this issue as of today, with thumbnails stretched as wide as the layout allows in both playlists and channel pages. This issue started happening right after I accidentally changed the \"Thumbnails per row\" setting (for which there's no reset button turn back the default behavior). Any value I set to it doesn't affect this issue.\n\nTried backing up my settings, clearing all settings in the extension using the \"Reset all settings\" button inside the extension's backup settings, and modifying my settings.json file to remove the thumbnails setting before loading it back to the extension. However, while the number of thumbnails per row returned to the normal value used by youtube, the stretched thumbnails still appear, even though I removed the setting that caused this issue.\n\nMight try later to fully reinstall the extension and see if that works. \n\nBrowser: Firefox 140 on Linux.\n\nUpdate: Clearing extension settings while on a channel page instantly fixes the problem, but as soon as I import my settings again, the issue reappears. Reinstalling didn't work either, since it pulled my synchronized settings.\n\nUpdate 2: Ended up just resetting extension settings and restoring my configuration manually. Tried checking the json for any extraneous settings that might have been changed, but nothing stood out as the source for the issue. Clearing cookies didn't help either, just in case.", "Same here, reset settings and restoring my configuration manually and the bug isn't reproduced. Have to hard refresh a couple times for theming to properly change, but again, bug not reproduced. ", "> Same here, reset settings and restoring my configuration manually and the bug isn't reproduced. Have to hard refresh a couple times for theming to properly change, but again, bug not reproduced.\n\n\nSo the issue is fixed for you then? No synchronisation, manual backup, reset settings, check a playlist, re-import settings, restart browser, check playlist. No messing with settings or .json file in between any steps.\nThat's what seems to work for me.\n\nI have 'four thumbnails per row' on Windows and 'five' on Linux. They are both fine. Changing them after this is fixed may break it again. I am not willing to do that. This bug ruins YouTube for me, I use playlists a lot.", "Yes, the issues are fixed for me. \n\nhttps://github.com/code-charity/youtube/issues/3038#issuecomment-3105638055\n\nIn here, this is on a different device, a W11 laptop, with Zen as well. Fresh install of improved youtube (IY), everything is fine. Imported my .json file I shared in this issue post, bugged playlist and home channel. reset settings, everything fine again. manually set via GUI, not by json file, like the bugged set up from my first device. everything is fine, playlist and channel home not bugged. \n\nNow in my first device, the W10 PC, I reset settings, import the new settings on the W11 laptop. issue is fixed. playlist and channel home not bugged. changed the number per row to 8 just for extreme. still not bugged. \n\nno messing with json file because I don't really know json, and also don't really want to try it lol. ", "@91grayjay  Ok, cool. So it seems like something was changed in an Improve YouTube update that our old settings didn't like. Maybe the way to fix it for everyone, is to have the Add-on (somehow) backup all settings, reset them and then re-apply them.\n\nI'm not sure how because it needs to ask for an extra permission to backup the settings. Possibly export to memory first instead?\nI wonder how many people this has effected that dropped the Add-on because it is the easy fix?", "I was mainly experiencing this on YT homepages. One of the last settings I changed was the **Thumbnail Size**. This setting, when changed, breaks the layout in some cases.\n\nThis can be validated by resetting all settings and only updating that as I do below.\n\n<img width=\"800\" height=\"500\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f5abc82-ecf4-4517-823b-40f2cdea0625\" />\n\n<img width=\"800\" height=\"500\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/278eb715-0ba1-4a24-94ec-6d3ef12c30f6\" />\n\nIt remains broken no matter which option you pick. A way to fix it without manually setting up the extension again:\n\n- Export a backup of existing files\n- Open the JSON\n- Find the **thumbnail_size** setting and remove it and its value\n- Reset existing settings on Improve YouTube, do not skip this\n- Import your settings again\n- And most importantly, don't change the Thumbnail Size setting again\n\nHopefully this can help save some time for others that stumble across it \uD83D\uDE42 " ],

This is particularly the case for tutorials with interactive, non-static plots (e.g. plotly). Additionally, some tutorials don't have any plots.\n\nI think I have found a way to add thumbnails to the tutorial gallery without using the tutorial metadata.\n\nPR #874 adds images to four of the tutorial gallery thumbnails:\n- Binary Contingency Table Tutorial\n- Risk Matrix Score Tutorial\n- Isotonic Regression Tutorial\n- Block Bootstrapping Tutorial\n\nMy solution is a little clunky, but (a) I struggled to find **any solution** at all (it took hours to even come up with this less than ideal solution) and (b) I wanted to make it relatively straightforward to explain and maintain over time.\n\nI am putting up this PR now, before finishing off the rest of the images, to check it actually works properly when merged into develop. (It built okay on my machine, but I would like to make sure it actually works).\n\nIf this is successful, when I get a chance I will try and add the rest of the thumbnails. When I get a chance, I will also attempt to document what the approach is, both so that I can remember and so that other people can also follow the process.\n\nIf anyone has a more elegant solution, then great.\n\n@nicholasloveday I think you have raised this before as something that would be good to do, so feel free to take a look at what I have done and see what you think.", "This has now been merged to develop, and I can see all four thumbnails (binary contingency table; risk matrix score; isotonic regression; block bootstrapping) are rendering properly in the tutorial gallery on readthedocs.

We're lucky if the batch of events requires a full site rebuild, because then we can let the rebuild cover all other events. If we have multiple events and none require a site rebuild, we have to add logic to make sure that the union of all changes required is applied correctly, and its this logic that gets messy due to a variety of checks and sensitive ordering (ex: check for full rebuild cases, then partial update cases, etc.).\r\n\r\nI have a local implementation based on `notify-debouncer-full`. I have not read the code of `notify-debouncer-mini`, but if it is sensitive to the same events that `-full` is, including [opening and closing files](https://docs.rs/notify/6.1.1/notify/event/enum.AccessKind.html), we probably don't want `-mini` because we can't get at the event type and therefore filter those events out.\r\n\r\nI played with behavior on master by using this toy script and a personal project:\r\n\r\n```\r\necho \" \" >> config.toml\r\necho \" \" >> config.toml\r\necho \" \" >> content/blog/2024-05-14.md\r\necho \" \" >> content/blog/2024-05-14.md\r\ntouch templates/foo.html templates/bar.html\r\ntouch sass/foo.scss\r\ntouch sass/bar.scss\r\ntouch sass/baz.scss\r\n```\r\n\r\nMaster shows (truncated in places):\r\n\r\n```\r\nChange detected @ 2024-05-17 20:52:35\r\n-> Config changed.

That way we can reuse a lot of the existing handling logic in `serve`, and the diff becomes a bit less messy.

      "comments" : [ "I second this. This would be great.", "After looking into this more, I am not sure what the best method to accomplish this would be.\n\nMy initial thought was to do something like adding a property called `AdormentTooltip` that you could set for example \n```cshtml\n<MudTextField @ref=\"multilineReference\" T=\"string\" Label=\"Multiline Select\" Lines=\"3\" Variant=\"Variant.Outlined\" Text=\"@sampleText\" Adornment=\"Adornment.End\" AdornmentIcon=\"@Icons.Material.Filled.Api\" OnAdornmentClick=\"@(() => multilineReference.SelectAsync())\" AdornmentTooltip=\"Select All Text\" />\n```\n\nHowever, I don't like this method because it doesn't allow users to fully customize the Tooltip as you are unable to provide additional Tooltip settings. So, I decided to do something like:\n\n```cshtml\n<MudTextField @ref=\"multilineReference\" T=\"string\" Label=\"Multiline Select\" Lines=\"3\" Variant=\"Variant.Outlined\" Text=\"@sampleText\" Adornment=\"Adornment.End\" AdornmentIcon=\"@Icons.Material.Filled.Api\" OnAdornmentClick=\"@(() => multilineReference.SelectAsync())\" AdornmentTooltip=\"Select All Text\" AdornmentTooltipOptions=\"@TooltipOptions\" />\n\n@code {\n  private Dictionary<string, dynamic> TooltipOptions => new Dictionary<string, dynamic> {\n    { \"Duration\", 500.00 },\n    { \"Arrow\", true },\n    { \"Placement\", Placement.Right },\n    { \"Color\", Color.Secondary },\n    { \"RootStyle\", \"width: 100%;\" },\n    { \"Style\", \"font-size: 1rem; padding: 0.5rem 1.25rem;\" },\n  };\n}\n```\nWhich this appears to work, but this feels dirty too.\n\nSo lastly, I tried to do something like this:\n```cshtml\n<MudTextField @ref=\"multilineReference\" T=\"string\" Label=\"Multiline Select\" Lines=\"3\" Variant=\"Variant.Outlined\" Text=\"@sampleText\" Adornment=\"Adornment.End\" AdornmentIcon=\"@Icons.Material.Filled.Api\" OnAdornmentClick=\"@(() => multilineReference.SelectAsync())\" />\n  <AdornmentContent>\n    <MudTooltip Text=\"Select All Text\" Duration=\"500.00\" Color=\"Color.Secondary\">\n      <MudButtonIcon Icon=\"@Icons.Material.Filled.Api\" OnClick=\"@(() => multilineReference.SelectAsync())\" />\n    </MudTooltip>\n  </AdornmentContent>\n</MudTextField>\n```\nBut this felt very over engineering. I would really like feedback on which is the best method to implement this before continuing my work on this PR. Also, if anyone has any other suggestions, please let me know.", "this is easily the best method and follows the pattern of many controls. Nullable so if it doesn't exist you just do what has always been done. You will, however need to add this to MudField too, and lots of documentation. so if you use AdornmentContent all other Adornment features would be ignored except Adornment.End/Start. I like it.\n\n```\n<MudTextField @ref=\"multilineReference\" T=\"string\" Label=\"Multiline Select\" Lines=\"3\" Variant=\"Variant.Outlined\" Text=\"@sampleText\" Adornment=\"Adornment.End\" AdornmentIcon=\"@Icons.Material.Filled.Api\" OnAdornmentClick=\"@(() => multilineReference.SelectAsync())\" />\n  <AdornmentContent>\n    <MudTooltip Text=\"Select All Text\" Duration=\"500.00\" Color=\"Color.Secondary\">\n      <MudButtonIcon Icon=\"@Icons.Material.Filled.Api\" OnClick=\"@(() => multilineReference.SelectAsync())\" />\n    </MudTooltip>\n  </AdornmentContent>\n</MudTextField>\n```", "Agree with @versile2 . Having a RenderFragment parameter that overrides all the other Adornment parameters makes sense. It is also mostly backwards compatible since it is only applied if it is non-null.", "I feel the same way, I just wanted to ask for feedback before I spend time implementing it only to realize it's not the preferred method I should have gone down.", "Hi! Any updates on this feature? I was just now looking for the option \uD83D\uDE04 ", "This could be implemented without a breaking change. Just need two things, @danielchalmers or @ScarletKuro approval and someone willing to do the work. I'm not opposed but I'm backed up at least two weeks.", "Yes, icon buttons should be able to define both an ARIA label and a tooltip.\n\nAn elegant solution for the user, without [reworking adornment markup](https://github.com/MudBlazor/MudBlazor/issues/8945), could be to automatically add the MudTooltip behind the scenes:\n\n```razor\n@if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(AdornmentTooltip))\n{\n    <MudTooltip Text=\"@AdornmentTooltip\">\n        <MudInputAdornment Class=\"@AdornmentClassname\"\n                        Icon=\"@AdornmentIcon\"\n                        Color=\"@AdornmentColor\"\n                        Size=\"@IconSize\"\n                        Text=\"@AdornmentText\"\n                        Placement=\"@Adornment.Start\"\n                        AdornmentClick=\"@OnAdornmentClick\" />\n    </MudTooltip>\n}\nelse\n{\n    <MudInputAdornment Class=\"@AdornmentClassname\"\n                    Icon=\"@AdornmentIcon\"\n                    Color=\"@AdornmentColor\"\n                    Size=\"@IconSize\"\n                    Text=\"@AdornmentText\"\n                    Placement=\"@Adornment.Start\"\n                    AdornmentClick=\"@OnAdornmentClick\" />\n}\n```\n\nNot as elegant on the backend but would provide the least friction before/if adornments are reworked." ],

I'm experiencing the same issue, I want to configure hybrid_search with weighted_score when I create some document, but it's not working. I tried passing my retrieval_model object like:\n\n`retrieval_model: {\n      search_method: 'hybrid_search',\n      reranking_enable: true,\n      reranking_mode: 'weighted_score',\n      vector_setting: {\n        vector_weight: 0.7,\n        embedding_provider_name: 'openai',\n        embedding_model_name: 'text-embedding-3-large',\n      },\n      keyword_setting: {\n        keyword_weight: 0.3,\n      },\n      top_k: 5,\n      score_threshold_enabled: false,\n      score_threshold: 0,\n    },`\n\nWhat is the correct way to pass these data to API? The path route is '/v1/datasets/${datasetId}/document/create-by-file'", "@dosu\nis it possible to configure the hybrid search with weighted_score using the dify API?", "<!-- Answer -->\nYes, it is possible to configure the hybrid search with `weighted_score` using the Dify API. The correct way to pass the data to the API is by structuring the `weights` parameter as a dictionary within the `retrieval_model` object. Here's an example of how you should format your payload:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"retrieval_model\": {\n    \"search_method\": \"hybrid_search\",\n    \"reranking_enable\": true,\n    \"reranking_mode\": \"weighted_score\",\n    \"weights\": {\n      \"vector_setting\": {\n        \"vector_weight\": 0.7,\n        \"embedding_provider_name\": \"openai\",\n        \"embedding_model_name\": \"text-embedding-3-large\"\n      },\n      \"keyword_setting\": {\n        \"keyword_weight\": 0.3\n      }\n    },\n    \"top_k\": 5,\n    \"score_threshold_enabled\": false,\n    \"score_threshold\": 0\n  }\n}\n```\n\nEnsure that the `weights` parameter is correctly structured as shown above. This setup allows you to assign custom weights to semantic and keyword searches, enabling a balance between full-text search and vector search <sup>[[1]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/12546)</sup>.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To continue talking to [Dosu](https://dosu.dev), mention @dosu.*\n\n---\n<sup>Help Dosu learn!

Because if i install it from github it requires daemon and not install in solus. As you mentioned solus is for home use most of the people use laptops and face battery life issues with this you can improve battery life of laptops. Please add this everyone will be very happy if they get more battery life. Thanks.\n\n### Are we allowed to redistribute it?\n\n_No response_\n\n### What kind of user will use this package, and how many users do you think will use this package?\n\nEvery person who uses laptops for linux will likely is going to use this. Right now many people use this tool in other distros and it work very well.\n\n### Link to source archive file\n\nhttps://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases/tag/v2.2.0",

      "description" : "Most use of `matplotlib` througout the package rely on the implicit `pyplot` API.\n\nI'd advocate for using the more explicit OOP-oriented API since it is considered cleaner, more pythonic, and allows for more control over plots.\n\nThe difference between the 2 APIs is described here :  https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/figure/api_interfaces.html\n\n## Example for distributions\n\nFor example, in the base class for distributions, the `view` method : \n\nhttps://github.com/HarrisonKramer/optiland/blob/6530b818bdac359858bcd0368fa950e5c53b7476/optiland/distribution.py#L58\n\nuses `plt` for accessing `matplotlib`. This code could be replace with, for example : \n\n**Before**\n\n```python\n    def view(self):\n        \"\"\"Visualize the distribution.\n\n        This method plots the distribution points and a unit circle for\n            reference.\n        \"\"\"\n        plt.plot(self.x, self.y, \"k*\")\n        t = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 256)\n        x, y = np.cos(t), np.sin(t)\n        plt.plot(x, y, \"r\")\n        plt.xlabel(\"Normalized Pupil Coordinate X\")\n        plt.ylabel(\"Normalized Pupil Coordinate Y\")\n        plt.axis(\"equal\")\n        plt.show()\n```\n\n**After**\n```python\n    def view(self, ax=None):\n        \"\"\"Visualize the distribution.\n    \n        This method plots the distribution points and a unit circle for\n            reference.\n        \"\"\"\n        if ax is None:\n            fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n        \n        ax.plot(self.x, self.y, \"k*\")\n        t = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 256)\n        x, y = np.cos(t), np.sin(t)\n        ax.plot(x, y, \"r\")\n        ax.set_xlabel(\"Normalized Pupil Coordinate X\")\n        ax.set_ylabel(\"Normalized Pupil Coordinate Y\")\n        ax.set_aspect(\"equal\")\n        return ax\n```\n\nThis way :\n- the user can either provide the `Axes` or let the method just create a new one with signature `(self, ax=None): `\n- and return the `Axes` for further customization with `return ax` \n- and delay the actual displaying by removing `plt.show()`\n\n## Generalization\n\nThis approach could (and should?) be applied throughout all plottings with `matplotlib` in the package:\n - https://github.com/HarrisonKramer/optiland/blob/4000c03774e889cba85599c71669b2bba9d037d1/optiland/visualization/visualization.py#L48\n - https://github.com/HarrisonKramer/optiland/blob/6530b818bdac359858bcd0368fa950e5c53b7476/optiland/psf.py#L107\n - https://github.com/HarrisonKramer/optiland/blob/6530b818bdac359858bcd0368fa950e5c53b7476/optiland/wavefront.py#L421\n\n## Note on circles\n\nI believe using \n```python\ncircle = plt.Circle((xc, yc), R, fill=False)\nax.add_patch(circle)\n```\nis considered a cleaner approach to plot a circle on an ax (removes the need for sampling `t = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 256)' )",

The older version (result 0.15.1) is quite a bit better than the newer (since I can round to three decimal places to get the expected results or read from a filehandle instead of using `from_csv()` or `read_csv()`). The newer version (0.18.0) loses information, which is not acceptable.\n\nNote that the documentation at http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.18.1/generated/pandas.DataFrame.from_csv.html reads\n\n> It is preferable to use the more powerful `pandas.read_csv()` for most general purposes, but `from_csv` makes for an easy roundtrip to and from a file (the exact counterpart of `to_csv`), especially with a DataFrame of time series data.\n\nBut this does not describe what actually happens, as demonstrated above.\n",

I wanted to determine under what circumstances it is reasonable to expect round-trip conversion from CSV (i.e., decimal) to binary floating-point and back. Basically, there are specific conditions (i.e., inequalities) relating the precisions in decimal and binary that specify when you can reasonably expect a round-trip conversion to work exactly.\n\nUnfortunately, I'm travelling and will not have access to the old laptop with those notes on them until I return home (~Aug. 1). If you do take this issue from @hualiu01 , I will share my notes with you as soon as I have them." ],

We do this elsewhere.", "So after looking into this more closely, I don't think we should be returning `map[string]string`. Users would use the [feature_flag consts defined in the semconv package](https://pkg.go.dev/go.opentelemetry.io/otel@v1.37.0/semconv/v1.34.0#section-readme:~:text=Namespace%3A%20feature_flag) to key into the map. But these are of type [attribute.Key](https://pkg.go.dev/go.opentelemetry.io/otel/attribute#Key). So a user would need to do `event[string(semconv.FeatureFlagResultReasonKey)]`, where event is the map. This is cumbersome and also requires the user to convert the map to [attribute.KeyValue](https://pkg.go.dev/go.opentelemetry.io/otel/attribute#KeyValue) in order to use the values with OTel. I think it is reasonable to assume that if someone uses OpenFeature, they also use OpenTelemetry. Instead of returning a map, it's much more convenient to return `[]attribute.KeyValue`. Then if there is a need to key into the slice of attributes, the user would use [attribute.NewSet](https://pkg.go.dev/go.opentelemetry.io/otel/attribute#NewSet) in order to first create a Set to use `Set.Value`. I can create a PR to showcase what this would look like, but essentially this means that the telemetry package provides first-class OTel support by returning attribute.KeyValue pairs.\n\nIf we go ahead with this proposal as-is, we would be using the semconv `attribute.Key`s and then converting those to `string` for each key because we need to return `map[string]string`. Then the user would use the semconv `attribute.Key`s to key into the map by also having to convert to `attribute.Key` to `string` first. This is rather backwards, and so we should be returning OTel-compatible attributes directly. The [attribute package](https://pkg.go.dev/go.opentelemetry.io/otel@v1.37.0/attribute) has builtin support for operations on attributes including filtering and getting values.", "Please see #418 " ],

Suggested Improvements:\nAdd text labels below or beside each icon\nExample:\n\n\uD83C\uDFE0 ??? ???Home???\n\n\uD83D\uDCDA ??? ???Courses???\n\n\uD83D\uDCAC ??? ???Discussions???\n\n\uD83D\uDCC4 ??? ???Notes???\n\n\uD83C\uDFAF ??? ???Roadmap???\n\nAlternatively, if keeping it icon-only:\n\nAdd tooltips (title or custom styled ones) on hover/focus\n\nEnsure they are keyboard accessible (for screen readers)\n\nHighlight active page more clearly (e.g., using underline or highlight animation)\n\nOn smaller screens (mobile/tablet):\n\nUse a hamburger menu with icon + text items for better UX\n\n\uD83E\uDDEA Expected Outcome:\nEasier for beginners to understand the navigation\n\nFaster onboarding for first-time users\n\nCleaner, modern, and accessible UI\n\nLess confusion on where to go or what each icon does\n\n\uD83D\uDCBB Screenshots:\n(Current screenshot already provided ??? you can upload this in the GitHub issue.)\n\n\uD83D\uDE4B?????????

However, when `Scene::parse_from_zone()` encounters a validation error, it immediately returns without evaluating the rest of the parameters. `parse_zones()` will also bubble up that error immediately as well. This leads to the user debugging a malformed zones file input error-by-error, which is a cumbersome task if the zones file has more than a handful of invalid values.\n\nInstead, `Scene::parse_from_zone()` should greedily evaluate all inputs in the line and compile all the validation errors and return them in bulk. `parse_zones()` will further compile these for *all* lines and finally return the full list of validation errors. Warnings should be similarly compiled and returned with the `Ok` value. We could use a Tuple like `(OK_VALUE,Option<Vec<ValidationWarning>>)`.\n\nAdditionally, in order to help the user quickly find the offending line(s), we should attach context like the line number and/or the start/end frame index so they know where to debug their zones file.\n\nThank you,\n\\- Boats M.",

      "description" : "Hello!\n\nThank you for this great package. I saw your contributing guidelines and they ask contributors to make an issue and wait for approval before sending any PR.\n\nI think a good feature to add to `preprocess_data` would be one to allow users to define the correlation method they want to use. By reading your code, I noticed it only supports spearman correlations so far. However, it is common in the microbiome field to work with CLR-transformed data, making other correlation methods more appropriated.\n\nThe proposed implementation would look like this to users:\n``` {r}\npreprocess_data(dataset = df, \n        outcome_colname = \"outcome\", \n        corr_method = \"pearson\", # new argument\n        collapse_corr_feats = TRUE)\n```\n\nI hope this requests makes sense. If you agree, I'd be happy to implement the relevant changes and submit a PR.\n\nBest,\nBen",

Expected Behavior\n\nI think since I can select the name field of first_record, I should be able to select the name field of last_record.\n\n### ??? Actual Behavior\n\nAfter the variable aggregator selects the name field of first_record in the list operation, it can only select the file of last_recore itself, but not the name field of last_record, and the group type is also displayed as file instead of the string type of first_record.name.\n\n<img width=\"1032\" height=\"528\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2893c011-7658-4288-8ff6-c600bdd63c29\" />\n\n<img width=\"715\" height=\"491\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/889f4e2c-f50e-4e36-8021-16c7e9d01d6b\" />",

Observe: Fields still contain the entered data.\n\n**Expected behaviour**\nClear all form fields immediately after successful account creation.\nAlternatively, redirect the user to a success page/login page to avoid confusion.\nIf there???s an error (e.g., invalid email), the form should retain the data (for correction), but on successful submission, it should reset.\n\n\n***Desktop (please complete the following information):**\n - OS: iOS\n - Browser: chrome\n - Version \n",

This would evaluate as false-y, while still be checked as `is None`.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nIdeally, color selection is something that would be done with a full style sheet with media selectors; however, that requires a full CSS implementation (see [Colosseum](https://github.com/beeware/colosseum)); and regardless, colosseum would still require an app's style applicator to provide the current dark/light mode as an input to the style process.\r\n\n\n### Additional context\n\nSee #2830 for the original request.\r\n\r\nThis will require an implementation on every backend, calling native APIs to determine dark mode status.",

This behavior repeats every time the page is saved while in this mode, resulting in additional duplications with each save.\n\n### How can we reproduce this issue?\n\n- Step 1: Create a new landing page using the ???Blank??? theme or a custom theme.\n- Step 2: Switch to the code edit mode and click save.\n- Step 3: Repeat switching between code edit mode and saving: The duplicates increase with each save.\n- Result: The <head> content (e.g., <meta> tags or <title>) is duplicated into the <body> section.\n\n**Expected Behavior:**\nThe <head> content should remain within the <head> section, as defined in the base.html.twig or other relevant templates, and should not be duplicated into the <body> section after making changes using the code edit function in the GrapeJS builder.\n\n**Actual Behavior:**\nParts of the <head> content, including <meta> tags and <title>, are repeatedly copied into the <body> section of the generated HTML page.\n\n**Additional Information:**\nThis issue occurs with the default ???Blank??? theme, which indicates that it is not directly related to custom HTML or themes. It seems to be an issue with how the HTML code is processed in the editor.\n\n**Screenshot:**\n<img width=\"1680\" alt=\"mautic_auto_duplicate_issue\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b135422c-a615-44a8-bf32-eff0118e6552\" />\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I confirm that I have read and agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\n\n<br /><hr>\nCare about this issue?

The easiest and fastest way would be to switch to code mode and add the snippet or changes manually.\n\nHowever, I currently can???t do that without generating invalid HTML???specifically, duplicated <head> content appears at the top.\nI???m surprised no one else seems to be struggling with this behavior? \uD83D\uDE05", "Not yet, we haven't got any paid resources to work on bugs so we're dependent on someone in the community picking it up and I think not so many are using landing pages at this time. If you want you can chip into the bounty pot and we can see if that entices someone to pick it up?", "@RCheesley Thank you, Ruth, for the quick response!\n\nI???d be absolutely fine with contributing financially if someone picks this up to fix it.\nWe???re currently getting more and more requests for Mautic landing pages, and overall, it works like a charm ??? so I???m happy to support the development.\n\n**How can I contribute to the bounty pot?**\nMaybe you could give me a quick briefing on how to proceed.\nThanks in advance and kind regards!", "Hi @bchristi83 please read the bottom of the issue above - just let folks know in #t-product on Slack (https://mautic.org/slack) if you add a bounty, as I'm OOO for the next two weeks. They'll be able to add the bounty label and update the title to represent the amount contributed.", "Hey @RCheesley I hope I did everything right! \uD83D\uDE42\nHere???s my transaction ???

I don't know what is the desired and possible outcome. But there is a mismatch between the codeeditor and the GrapesJS visual editor based on how the content gets transfered from one to the other.\nfrom grapesjs->codeeditor its creates a full html from template + visual components rendered as html + at the end a style entry.\nfrom codeeditor -> grapesjs it uses `this.editor.setComponents(code.trim())` in /`plugins/GrapesJsBuilderBundle/Assets/library/js/codeMode/codeEditor.js`\nThis will try to convert the html from the code editor to graphejs components and this will move the code in the head to the body.\n\n**So for now the workaround is to remove the head tag and its content before saving.**\n\nFor a fix, is the expected behavior to ignore the head,  because must be edited via the template? Then we should just pass the body content to setComponents. Also the style tag maybe, must be handled if its linked to the template?\n\nOr if head must be taken into account it has to be added somewhere else, but I don't know how grapejs / templates are supposed to work in mautic.\n\nAlso from a UX perspective the modal of the codeeditor gets dissmised if a mouse or keyevent happens on the overlay outside of the modal, this makes lossing changes and is very frustrating.\n", "Hi @bfritscher \uD83D\uDC4B\n\nFirst of all ??? thank you so much for taking the time to look into this \uD83D\uDE4F\n\nYour workaround of removing the `<head>` block before saving is already super helpful and works as expected ??? thanks for that! ???\n\nThat said, you???re absolutely right: as soon as you want to make a custom change to the `<head>`, you???re stuck again. And unfortunately, it???s not really possible to solve this cleanly via the theme either ??? because whenever I make changes to the `<head>` section in my theme and upload it again, the changes only apply to the landing page after I reassign the theme.\n\uD83D\uDC49 But when I do that, I lose all existing content on the landing page, and it reverts to the theme???s default content. \uD83D\uDE15\n\nMaybe I???m still doing something wrong when building the theme ??? but so far I haven???t found a reliable way to preserve the landing page content when updating the theme.\n\nAlso yes??? the modal closing immediately when the mouse leaves the window has also caused me some painful moments \uD83D\uDE05\nOnce you know it, you can work around it ??? but yeah??? it???s not exactly a joy to deal with.\n\nThanks again and all the best!\nBenjamin", "This issue has a bounty associated with it.

Read the docs about how to work on the issue and claim the funds ", "Hi @bchristi83 , made a fix for version 6.x, the issue occurs in the `CodeEditor` class within the GrapesJS builder when users edit HTML in code mode. The problem stems from how the `updateCode()` method handles HTML content:\n\n1. **ContentService provides full HTML**: The `ContentService.getEditorHtmlContent()` method returns the complete HTML document including `<head>` and `<body>` sections\n2. **Incorrect component setting**: The `updateCode()` method was calling `this.editor.setComponents(code.trim())` with the full HTML document\n3. **Head duplication**: This caused the entire HTML (including `<head>` content) to be inserted into the editor's canvas, resulting in head content appearing in the body section\n\nI have submit a PR to fix the issue, let me know about any issue." ],

Here's what I was thinking:\n\n- On the group search page we have a text entry labelled \"Normal Sylow $p$-subgroup\" where the user enters a prime $p$ and then the program finds all groups that have normal Sylow $p$-subgroups. \n- If a value is entered, a second yes/no field labelled \"normal complement\" appears next to the \"normal Sylow $p$-subgroup\" box. It shouldn't appear by itself since it wouldn't make sense to check yes/no on the second box without anything in the first.\n\nPlease let me know if it sounds reasonable or if you had something else in mind!" ],

It could be used as well, either by providing names for these arrows or by adding the ascii sequences.\r\n",

The current dialog enables only the addition and deletion of fields.

Should be done in a combo-box allowing multiple selections.\r\n- [x] ~~Enable update of name:  I cannot fix typos in the name -- it should be possible to double click the name and then change the value:~~\r\n- [x] ~~Optional: Enable casing: I tried to add \"GoogleScholar\", but I could not type the capital \"s\".

The class [/src/main/java/org/jabref/model/entry/field/FieldProperty.java#L3](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/d81d37faaddd45257e445f1978f97994043dd2d4/src/main/java/org/jabref/model/entry/field/FieldProperty.java#L3) models properties of a field\r\n2. An EntryType specifies which fields are contained\r\n3. Custom Entry types are stored in [/src/main/java/org/jabref/model/entry/types/UnknownEntryType.java#L8](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/d81d37faaddd45257e445f1978f97994043dd2d4/src/main/java/org/jabref/model/entry/types/UnknownEntryType.java#L8)\r\n4. Custom Fields are stored in [org.jabref.model.entry.field.UnknownField](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/d81d37faaddd45257e445f1978f97994043dd2d4/src/main/java/org/jabref/model/entry/field/UnknownField.java#L12)\r\n5. From the UI, a new Custom Entry Type is generated at [org.jabref.gui.preferences.customentrytypes.CustomEntryTypesTabViewModel#addNewCustomEntryType](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/d81d37faaddd45257e445f1978f97994043dd2d4/src/main/java/org/jabref/gui/preferences/customentrytypes/CustomEntryTypesTabViewModel.java#L130)\r\n6. [org.jabref.gui.preferences.customentrytypes.CustomEntryTypesTabViewModel#addNewField](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/d81d37faaddd45257e445f1978f97994043dd2d4/src/main/java/org/jabref/gui/preferences/customentrytypes/CustomEntryTypesTabViewModel.java#L145) is used to add a new field to the customized entry type\r\n7. There, [org.jabref.gui.preferences.customentrytypes.FieldViewModel](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/d81d37faaddd45257e445f1978f97994043dd2d4/src/main/java/org/jabref/gui/preferences/customentrytypes/FieldViewModel.java#L26) class is used to put a single FieldProperty. The issue is to be able to add more than one property\r\n8. JabRef saves the customized entry types into the .bib file:\\\r\n   ```bibtex\r\n   @Comment{jabref-entrytype: person: req[Name] opt[Googlescholar;Orcid]}\r\n   ```\r\n9. an example person looks as follows:\\\r\n   ```bibtex\r\n   @Person{demo,\r\n     name          = {Oliver Kopp},\r\n     googlescholar = {https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=nB2GungAAAAJ&hl=de&oi=ao},\r\n     orcid         = {https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6962-4290},\r\n   }\r\n   ```\r\n10. Proposal for the new format: Use `|` to separate field names with the list field properties: \r\n  - `@Comment{jabref-entrytype-v2: person: req[Name|PERSON_NAME] opt[Googlescholar|EXTERNAL;Orcid|EXTERNAL]}`\r\n  - `@Comment{jabref-entrytype-v2: customizedtype: req[title;author;date] opt[year;month;publisher]}`\r\n  - Note that is not necessary to provide properties to already known field names. It is not possible to overwrite field properties (currently). Reason: Parsing logic at [/src/main/java/org/jabref/model/entry/field/FieldFactory.java#L76](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/d81d37faaddd45257e445f1978f97994043dd2d4/src/main/java/org/jabref/model/entry/field/FieldFactory.java#L76). You can think of changing this in your implementation. But take this as optional.\r\n  - New field properties can be added by passing them at [/src/main/java/org/jabref/model/entry/field/FieldFactory.java#L90](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/d81d37faaddd45257e445f1978f97994043dd2d4/src/main/java/org/jabref/model/entry/field/FieldFactory.java#L90)\r\n   ```java\r\n      .orElse(new UnknownField(fieldName));\r\n   ```\r\n  - Note that I added `-v2`, because the new format is NOT backwards-compatible with the old one and thus JabRef users might loose data if they switch versions back and forth.\r\n  - Note that there might be no field properties given. See discussion at https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3251.\r\n  - The proposal is NOT backwards-compatible. We can also come up with a completely new format. Nested JSON. Then, the string after `jabref-entrytype-v2:` needs to be forwarded to a JSON parser. \r\n\r\nHints:\r\n\r\n1. IDE hint: By holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and then click with the mouse on an identifier, you can navigate to the usage of a class, method, etc.\r\n2. IDE hint: By holding<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd>, you can search all text occurrences. Helpful to find some code.\r\n3. Please try to understand the current UI\r\n4. Add a sketch of the new UI - maybe this helps to understand the issue more\r\n5. Define the new data format for writing `jabref-entrytype`\r\n6. Add test cases for the new data format. The tests should go into [org.jabref.logic.exporter.MetaDataSerializerTest](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/d81d37faaddd45257e445f1978f97994043dd2d4/src/test/java/org/jabref/logic/exporter/MetaDataSerializerTest.java#L31). \r\n7. A new test class for [org.jabref.logic.importer.util.MetaDataParser](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/d81d37faaddd45257e445f1978f97994043dd2d4/src/main/java/org/jabref/logic/importer/util/MetaDataParser.java#L32). Needs to be created. This can be done with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd> and then <kbd>Enter</kbd>. `parseCustomEntryType` should be tested.\r\n8. You can also work on `org.jabref.model.entry.field.FieldFactoryTest`, because `org.jabref.model.entry.field.FieldFactory` is called in `MetaDataParser`.\r\n9. Other tests are in [org.jabref.model.entry.BibEntryTypesManagerTest](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/d81d37faaddd45257e445f1978f97994043dd2d4/src/test/java/org/jabref/model/entry/BibEntryTypesManagerTest.java#L158)\r\n11.

I added all the FieldsProperty by `fieldPropertyCheckComboBox.getItems().addAll(FieldProperty.values());` in **CustomEntryTypesTab#initialize()**. I'm wondering the timing that allow user to set the field properties. Following are my thoughts right now:\r\n1. After user type in the field name but before pressing the add button, enable the CheckComboBox to allow user to set field properties. Once they choose the properties, and they could press add button.\r\n2. After user type in the field name and add it to the field column, and then, when they select the field, enable CheckComboBox to allow user to set field properties. There will be a new \"plus sign\" button next to the CheckComboBox to handle the logic\r\n\r\nNot sure if I'm on the right track and would love to discuss more\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1101\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-06-18 at 5 18 12 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/assets/87943503/871bcf1e-1312-4de5-873b-428c08c5e5a8\">", "Thank you for continuing working on this.\r\n\r\nThe dropdown with the selection allements is good.\r\n\r\nI would suggest to modify the field labels of the add buttons to really show the action taken \"`Add`\" or \"`Modify`\".\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/assets/1366654/c65d956d-b6b8-4539-8662-759e78a67dd5)\r\n\r\nThe property can be empty, then you can show (\"default\") in gray (if that is possible in JavaFX).

Reason: the incoming object might be a \"constant\" object. All ViewModels should be implemented the same way.\r\n> \r\n> @calixtus Maybe you have something to add?\r\n\r\nThere are two places a new FieldViewModel is constructed. `CustomEntryTypesTabViewModel#addNewField` and `EntryTypeViewModel#EntryTypeViewModel` one has a `Field`, one only has a name. You could probably either overload the constructor or change the constructor to only accepts the name as a String. I prefer the first one: To provide a field for one constructor and overload the constructor with a String, but the `toField` method has to be retained.\r\n", "Case 1: This is OK. In addition, a) the field name should be shown and b) show the current field properties.\r\n\r\nReason for b): You rendering in \"Required and optional fields\" does not show the properties. This is OK, because GUI coding is hard. However, there should be a change for the average user to check the field properties. Currently, they are only visible in the code.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/assets/1366654/4dbfac29-b23b-489f-ae3f-d3b5dfe9c5a3)\r\n\r\nCase 2: \r\n\r\n- Checking if it is a standard field: Do not duplicate \"semantics\" of code. Please use `org.jabref.model.entry.field.FieldFactory#parseField(java.lang.String)`: `boolean isStandardField = FieldFactory.parseField(name) instanceOf StandardField;`. I read from your  code that you already have an instance of Field at hand. Thus, you can just use `instanceof` there. Note that I could not provide the full code, because `fieldsForAdding` is IMHO the list of all fields available in the combo box. We are talking about the place where a new entry is added.\r\n- The screenshot is strange. It is \"CitationKey\", which should also be forbidden, because it is an InternalField (add it to your thinking of case 1).\r\n- Let's discuss concrete examples. Then, you also have a base for test cases. Let's assume the user wants to add `exampleCustomField`. The user selected properties `DATE` and `DOI`. This is a strange selection. I think, you are beginning to discuss, which FieldProperties are mutually exclusive. I think, `org.jabref.model.entry.field.StandardField` is a good list of field property combinations. Nearly none of the fields have more than one property. Only exception `FieldProperty.EXTERNAL, FieldProperty.VERBATIM` for `URL` - and `UserSpecificCommentField`: `FieldProperty.COMMENT, FieldProperty.MULTILINE_TEXT`. --> And more thinking: `FILE_EDITOR` and `EXTERNAL` implies `VERBATIM`. `COMMENT` implies `MULTILINE_TEXT`. Thus, I **change** the specification: Allow the user to select **at most one** field property. If the Field is generated, AND the property is `FILE_EDITOR`, `EXTERNAL`, `COMMENT`, then add the implied property **at the end of the viewModel**, which is `org.jabref.gui.preferences.customentrytypes.FieldViewModel#toField`.\r\n\r\nCase 3: Correct.\r\n\r\n", "@DinjerChang @eric052199 are you still on it, or can I move this back to \"free to take\"?", "Yes, you could move it back.

      "description" : "### \uD83D\uDC5F Reproduction steps\n\n- To trigger this bug, begin by accessing the Auth, \r\n- Create a new user account and navigate to the user profile to verify the account. \r\n- Start the verification process for both the email address and the phone number associated with the user account. Initially, verify the email address, which should proceed smoothly. \r\n- Next, attempt to verify the phone number, Despite the successful verification of the email address, the system incorrectly indicates that the user is unverified when verifying the phone number. \r\n- In an attempt to rectify this inconsistency, proceed to unverify the phone number. Unexpectedly, the system now displays an alert indicating that the user is verified, contradicting the initial indication of being unverified.\n\n### \uD83D\uDC4D Expected behavior\n\n- When the user hits **Verify Phone**, the alert should confirm that the `user is verified`.\r\n- When the user hits **Unverify Phone**, the alert should confirm that the `user is unverified`.\n\n### \uD83D\uDC4E Actual Behavior\n\nWhen attempting to **verify the phone numbe**r, an alert incorrectly states that the `user is unverified`. \r\nHowever, when attempting to **unverify the phone**, the system incorrectly indicates that the `user is verified.`\n\n### \uD83C\uDFB2 Appwrite version\n\nVersion 1.4.x\n\n### \uD83D\uDCBB Operating system\n\nWindows\n\n### \uD83E\uDDF1 Your Environment\n\n_No response_\n\n### \uD83D\uDC40 Have you spent some time to check if this issue has been raised before?\n\n- [X] I checked and didn't find similar issue\n\n### \uD83C\uDFE2 Have you read the Code of Conduct?\n\n- [X] I have read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/appwrite/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)",

", "Hi, I am working on this!\n", "Hi, I'm working on this.", "> Hi, I'm working on this.\n\nOur team was able to reproduce the bug:\n\n\"When attempting to verify the phone number, an alert incorrectly states that the user is unverified.\nHowever, when attempting to unverify the phone, the system incorrectly indicates that the user is verified.\"\n\nThis looked like a condition logic flaw to us.  We then found the condition that was causing the flaw [here](https://github.com/appwrite/console/blob/main/src/routes/(console)/project-%5Bregion%5D-%5Bproject%5D/auth/user-%5Buser%5D/updateStatus.svelte#L49)\n\nWhich was missing a bang.\n\n[stnguyen90](https://github.com/stnguyen90) mentioned the desired behavior:\n\tXYZ's email has been verified\n\tXYZ's email has been unverified\n\tXYZ's phone has been verified\n\tXYZ's phone has been unverified\nNote:\n  The \"s\" should only be there if the name does not end with s. For example, if the user's name was \"Charles\", it should be \"Charles' email has been verified\"\n\nWe implemented a solution that met these requirements by changing this [code](https://github.com/appwrite/console/blob/main/src/routes/(console)/project-%5Bregion%5D-%5Bproject%5D/auth/user-%5Buser%5D/updateStatus.svelte#L48-L50)\n\nTo this code:\n`message: ${$user.name || $user.email || $user.phone || 'The account'}${( $user.name || $user.email || $user.phone || 'The account' ).endsWith('s') ? \"'\" : \"'s\"} email has been ${!$user.emailVerification ? 'unverified' : 'verified'},`\n\nOur team then implemented the same solution to updateVerificationEmail() as well, as seen [here](https://github.com/appwrite/console/pull/2112/files)\n\nThis solution can be tested just as [gurjeetsinghvir](https://github.com/gurjeetsinghvirdee) shows in the video posted to this issue.  Under a project, select Auth. In Auth, select or create a user that has both an email and a phone number. Select the 'Verify account' option and then verify the phone number and email. The correct alerts will be displayed.\n\nHere is out PR: [fix-1392](https://github.com/appwrite/console/pull/2112)\n\nDid we approach this issue correctly?  Shoutouts to my teammate @anthonythang1", "@toukirkhan would love to get an update or status here, thank you :)\n\n@MicahHeneveld , my apologies for the misunderstanding, Toukirkhan already mentioned he's working on it (and sent me a DM about it that his team is also working on it with him to prepare a PR). I just forgot to assign it on time. If Toukirkhan cancels or does not continue, we will review your PR next.\n\nWe also updated the contributor guide to be more clear on the proper steps before putting in a PR for next time, since there were 3 people working on a PR the same time. (not a bad thing, right?) :)  I appreciate your efforts and hoping to see more from ya :) ", "We discussed this again internally and we want to avoid the awkward \"'s\" and \"unverified\" so the desired behavior is:\n\nWe want to update the alerts to be specific to say:\n\nif name exists and isn't empty:\n> The email for XYZ has been verified\n> The email for XYZ is no longer verified\n> The phone for XYZ has been verified\n> The phone for XYZ is no longer verified\n\nif name does not exist or is empty:\n> The email has been verified\n> The email is no longer verified\n> The phone has been verified\n> The phone is no longer verified\n\nAs a reminder, the code that needs to be updated is here:\n\nhttps://github.com/appwrite/console/blob/4538dbb7efab8465cf9ba63282522bc686c70659/src/routes/(console)/project-%5Bregion%5D-%5Bproject%5D/auth/user-%5Buser%5D/updateStatus.svelte#L18-L61", "> We discussed this again internally and we want to avoid the awkward \"'s\" and \"unverified\" so the desired behavior is:\n> \n> We want to update the alerts to be specific to say:\n> \n> if name exists and isn't empty:\n> \n> > The email for XYZ has been verified\n> > The email for XYZ is no longer verified\n> > The phone for XYZ has been verified\n> > The phone for XYZ is no longer verified\n> \n> if name does not exist or is empty:\n> \n> > The email has been verified\n> > The email is no longer verified\n> > The phone has been verified\n> > The phone is no longer verified\n\nI've done the fix PR complied with the teams demand and was notified me that this issue is taking care of by internal team as of now, It has been some time but the bug remains. 3 days ago this issue assigned to someone and he still didn't finish it. Meantime I clarified with the team and did as they said and They are still waiting for the assignee to finish the task. There is no response from both of them. Assignee is taking like a month to finish this simple thing and not even responding. @stnguyen90 @tessamero consider my PR or Reference my PR to solve this. You guys think about it, unlike others I am constantly checking on Issues and PR related to Appwrite and spending my time to resolve issues as much as I can. @stnguyen90 even provided the code to be changed for them to do it faster but still no response.\n \n> [!NOTE]\n> Its True that I didn't ask for Issue assign but I am the one who asked for the opinion on how to address the popup and we came to the conclusion of going with the current format meanwhile others didn't even took the initiative to do so." ],

Full Stack Demo Setup**\n\n**Issue #117**\n**Assigned to:** @Coder-010506\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDCCC **Objective:**\n\nIntegrate **Stripe** as a payment gateway for handling **premium subscriptions** or donations on the platform. The integration should mimic **Razorpay???s simple flow**, using **Stripe Elements** on the frontend and secure APIs on the backend.\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDD27 **Frontend Requirements:**\n\n??? Build a **PaymentForm.tsx** component using **Stripe Elements**:\n\n* Card input field\n* Name input field\n* Submit button\n\n??? Display dynamic messages for:\n\n* Payment initiated\n* Payment successful\n* Payment failed\n\n??? Route: `/premium/payment`\n\n* This page will be accessible via the **\"Upgrade to Pro\"** section.\n\n??? Use Axios to call backend `/create-payment-intent`.\n\n??? After payment success, redirect to a confirmation page and log transaction in the database.\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDD10 **Backend Requirements:**\n\n??? Create route:\n\n```js\nPOST /api/payment/create-payment-intent\n```\n\n??? Flow:\n\n* Get amount from frontend (optional if fixed).\n* Use **Stripe SDK** to generate **payment intent**.\n* Send `clientSecret` to frontend for confirmation.\n\n??? Use `dotenv` for storing secret keys:\n\n```\nSTRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_**************\n```\n\n??? Optional: Create route to save the payment record in MongoDB:\n\n```js\nPOST /api/payment/record\n```\n\n??? Middleware:\n\n* Use JWT auth to verify the logged-in user making the payment.\n\n---\n\n### \uD83E\uDDEA **Testing Setup (Demo Mode):**\n\n* Use test Stripe public/private keys.\n* Card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`\n* Any CVV, expiry, and postal code work in test.\n\n---\n\n### \uD83E\uDDFE **Install These Dependencies:**\n\n```bash\nnpm install @stripe/stripe-js @stripe/react-stripe-js\nnpm install stripe express dotenv\n```\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDCDA **References (to follow):**\n\n* [[Stripe Docs - React + Node](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment)](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment)\n* [[Shadcn UI for UI Components](https://ui.shadcn.com/)](https://ui.shadcn.com)\n\n---\n\n### ??? **Deliverables:**\n\n* Fully working Stripe payment UI\n* Secure backend route for creating payment intent\n* Success & failure flow with alert\n* Record saved in DB (optional)\n\n---\n\n\uD83D\uDEA8 Important Reminder Before You Start! \uD83D\uDEA8\n\nHey folks \uD83D\uDC4B,\n\n\uD83D\uDCA1 Always make sure to pull the latest changes from the main branch before you start working on your feature or bug fix!\nThis helps you avoid merge conflicts and keeps your work in sync with the current codebase. ???\n\n\uD83D\uDD04 Steps to follow:\n\n1??????

I think having the resource loaders act as dicts is a good idea. However, if we expose the caches to the user, we should think about the implications. \n\nIf a user creates an actor with the `alien.png` image via `a = Actor(\"alien\")`, they might reasonably expect that afterwards they can access that image in the loader with `images[\"alien\"]`.\n\nThis would not be the case however, since currently `*args` and `**kwargs` are combined with the given image name to create the key for `_cache`.\n\nI think there's two options to fix this misunderstanding. Either remove the folding in of `*args` and `**kwargs` into the keys as I don't see them used anywhere in the project. Or, make it so `__getitem__()` for the loaders also returns items where the given key matches only the first element of the actual key tuple. In this case, it might also be necessary to return multiple elements though, if there is ambiguity.\n\nAs there doesn't seem to be a downside at this moment, I think I would prefer removing args and kwargs from the key generation.\n\nAnother thing to think about it how the loaders should act when an item is gotten that isn't cached yet. So far, resources are loaded automatically when they are needed. This would suggest that using `alien = images[\"alien\"]` would load the image if that hadn't happened yet. Should this be the case?\n\nThird, we should think about what keys actually mean in this context. Should a key always exactly match a filename? Should it instead be freely settable? The first would make the automatic loading of resources not yet gotten possible, that was mentioned above. If keys are freely providable, that might not be the case though.\n\n@lordmauve What are your opinions on this?" ],

      "description" : "Hi Matthias. I'm running lychee on a book with 574 total links reported, which is making it a little difficult to know which links I need to correct. The book is written with AsciiDoctor, so I first generated an HTML file. I don't mind that *.adoc isn't supported (#291) directly by lychee.\r\n\r\n## Redirects\r\n\r\nRunning lychee nightly (or rather, compile from source), the main issue I'm seeing is that there are a number of **redirects**, but it's difficult to tell which redirect belongs to which link.\r\n\r\n```\r\n~/src/github.com/lycheeverse/lychee/target/debug/lychee output/get-programming-with-go-manuscript.html -vv\r\n```\r\n\r\n![redirect-nightly](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee/assets/4566/6fc89646-71a4-43d8-9eb4-0e00b4bd1a5c)\r\n\r\nThe redirect to `https://www.red-gate.com`... is from the `https://www.simple-talk.com` link at the bottom of the screenshot shown, but they aren't tied together. I assume this is related to concurrency and the redirect being a debug log (#1117) rather than designed into the user experience.\r\n\r\nIdeally I'd like a report of which links required a redirect along with the final URL they redirected to. That way I could easily search for the original links and update them. (the intermediate redirects being a debug log is fine, as that doesn't concern me unless troubleshooting)\r\n\r\n## Excluded\r\n\r\nA related concern is the \"6 Excluded\" when looking at a list this large. If I scroll through the verbose version I can track them down, but there are hundreds of `??? [200] ` lines that I want to ignore, even with a single `-v`. Even piping to `grep` doesn't help. \r\n\r\nMost of the excluded in my example are email addresses, which is fine (2 repeated a few times). But one excluded link is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n? [EXCLUDED] https://gobyexample.com/ | Excluded\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom the HTML `<a href=\"https://gobyexample.com\" class=\"bare\">gobyexample.com</a>`. I'm not entirely sure why. So that's the sort of thing I'd like listed out.\r\n\r\n## Suggestion\r\n\r\nI think that the good links should only be shown with `-vv` and the corrections should be clearly shown with a single `-v` or even without.\r\n\r\nAlso may want to double check if there's an example.com default exclusion that's a little too aggressive.",

Please describe.**\r\n\r\nThere are two points for this:\r\n  - Some things, like startship or maybe the intellij plugin I was experimenting with, need to know the state of the jj repo constantly, and I don't want to snapshot the repo every second - I know in some situations that's fine, but often you want more control, especially in cases when editing .gitignore, etc\r\n  - I will never get over the auto-amend happenning on every single command including readonly ones, when often I feel like I don't need it. `--ignore-working-copy` _could've_ helped (at least in log it does), but the whole point is that I want to see changes I just did but not amend them, leaving the repo stale until I run some meaningful command and not obsess over running diff/status every second making snapshots.\r\n  For now I often run `git status` and `git diff` (and also starship shows git numbers, but there are different numbers between untracked and staged which is wonky), but I'd love to use jj only.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\n`jj util stale diff [-r @]` - `jj diff` but between the @ (or other) and the physical state of the files in working copy, `--ignore-working-copy` (meaning no snapshot made) implied.\r\n\r\nIt is under the util subcommand (and not, say, `jj diff --stale`) because it essentially is git staging, which I feel like you wouldn't want to have among first-class commands, this is an \"advanced\", \"low-level-ish\" feature (useful, again, in things like starship) - although if you're ok with `jj diff --stale`, so am I.\r\nMaaaybe there could be a `jj stale [verb]` set of commands, which is \"officially discouraged\" as it goes against the amend-everything principle :)\r\nOr maybe I'll write a `jj-stale` program that will just do all of that and be unofficial, and could be called by `jj stale` when we enable external subcommands\r\n\r\nAnother thing would be `jj util stale status` (`jj stale status`? :) ) which is just like `jj status`, but does not snapshot - the difference from `jj status --ignore-working-copy` is that here the latter ignores the stale changes (it just works with the wc commit which wasn't amended), the stale-status should show the same thing `jj status` would've shown if the snapshot _did_ happen - except it shouldn't\r\n",

We would still create the commit and add the `refs/jj/keep-*` ref, but if we don't commit the transaction, it won't be visible afterwards. We would need to implement GC (#12) for the `refs/jj/keep-*` to get GC'd. Alternatively, if we implement #50, we could postpone creating the `refs/jj-keep*` refs until the transaction commits (which means we wouldn't create the refs with `--no-commit-transaction`).", "That.. actually solves all of my problems, and seems not patched on, that's great, yes", "A `--no-commit-transaction` flag would help me fix https://codeberg.org/emacs-jj-vc/vc-jj.el/issues/61 so I'd be happy if this was implemented", "Oh hey, this is me from the future, I _did_ get over \"the auto-amend happenning on every single command including readonly ones\".\nIn fact it absolutely totally helped me a couple of times.\n\nAccidentally amending target/ or node_modules/ or otherwise having an incomplete .gitignore is still a footgun, but there's the heuristic and in general it's a one and done thing (and most often you can just recreate the repo if you forgot about it).\nOhh, and _especially_ the evil mode aka `snapshot.auto-track=\"none()\"`\n\n---\n\nBut the first point still stands, this would help avoiding pollutting the oplog by constant snashots from things like terminal prompts and emacs plugins - also I think current dynamic completions only consider the stale wc?", "A related feature might be to have something like a `--use-stale-working-copy`, which would load the repo at the operation recorded in the working copy. It would then snapshot as usual and record the new operation in the working copy without updating the op heads (making the working copy more stale if it was already stale). The same goes for any regular changes made by the command.

I???ll test it and open a PR when I have time, but feel free to take it on if you get to it first.\n\nRegarding the issue @martin-henz, the problem is that the frontend (src/commons/sideContent/content/SideContentSubstVisualizer.tsx) literal renders value based on `raw` field first, before rendering the `value` field.\n\nThe current version of the frontend handles `node.value` wrongly since it has not been properly converted to string.\n```ts\nconst stringifyLiteralValue = (value: any) => \n      return <span className=\"stepper-literal\">{node.raw ? node.raw : node.val}</span>;\n```\nThe correct version should be\n```ts\nconst stringifyLiteralValue = (value: any) => \n          typeof value === 'string' \n              ? '\"' + value + '\"' \n              : value !== null \n                ? value.toString() \n                : 'null';\n      return <span className=\"stepper-literal\">{node.raw ? node.raw : stringifyLiteralValue(node.value)}</span>;\n```\n\nThe reason why we overlook this issue is that we, most of the time, create literal with the correctly assigned raw field. For example, here is the snippet of the code from src/tracer/nodes/Expression/BinaryExpression.ts in js-slang.\n```ts\nlet ret = new StepperLiteral(\n      value,\n      typeof value === 'string' ? '\"' + value + '\"' : value !== null ? value.toString() : 'null',\n      undefined,\n      undefined,\n      this.loc,\n      this.range\n    )\n```\nThe raw field `typeof value === 'string' ? '\"' + value + '\"' : value !== null ? value.toString() : 'null'` has been properly assigned.\nHowever, in some of our built-in function implementation, we forget to put `raw` parameter.\n\n```ts\nis_null: {\n    definition: (arg: StepperExpression[]): StepperLiteral => {\n      return new StepperLiteral(\n        arg[0].type === 'Literal' && (arg[0] as StepperLiteral).value === null\n       // missing `raw` parameter\n      )\n    },\n    arity: 1\n  },\n```\n\nThere are two ways to fix the issue.\n- Adding raw parameter to all StepperLiteral instance.\n- Fix the StepperLiteral renderer in the frontend\n\nPersonally, I prefer the latter one since we should not heavily rely on `raw` parameter for rendering which is considered optional parameters in `js-slang` in the first place. Plus, it can be quickly fixed in the frontend repo." ],

      "description" : "### Goal\n\nSo far, Intlayer is only available for React environments.  \nHowever, Intlayer aims to support Angular and other frameworks as well.\n\nThe goal would be to implement the `angular-intlayer` package by using `react-intlayer` as a reference.\n\n`react-intlayer`: https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/tree/main/packages/react-intlayer\n`angular-intlayer`: https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/tree/main/packages/angular-intlayer\n\n### Code to implement\n\n- An equivalent of `IntlayerProvider` to maintain the selected language in the app???s context:  \n  https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/blob/main/packages/react-intlayer/src/client/IntlayerProvider.tsx\n\n- An equivalent of the `useLocale` hook, allowing users to change the language:  \n  https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/blob/main/packages/react-intlayer/src/client/useLocale.ts\n\n- Equivalents of the `useDictionary` and `useIntlayer` hooks to access Intlayer dictionaries within Angular components:  \n  https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/blob/main/packages/react-intlayer/src/client/useDictionary.ts  \n  https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/blob/main/packages/react-intlayer/src/client/useIntlayer.ts\n  > For `getDictionary` and `getIntlayer` functions, skip implementation of plugins in a first time.\n\n### Example app to update\n\nIn the monorepo, at /examples/angular-app, you will create an basic app Angular for demo. The purpose would be to internationalise this app using the `angular-intlayer` package.\n\n### Doc\n\nIn the monorepo, at https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/tree/main/docs/en/intlayer_with_angular.md, you will find the documentation to set up intlayer in a Angular application. This doc will then be accessible publicly on the [official Intlayer online documentation](https://intlayer.org/doc)\n\n---\n\n### Going further:\n\n- Reproduce an equivalent of the **IntlayerNode** to connect the visual editor to a Angular app:  \n  https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/blob/main/packages/react-intlayer/src/IntlayerNode.tsx\n\n- Reproduce the plugin to render **IntlayerNode** components:  \n  https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/blob/main/packages/react-intlayer/src/plugins.tsx\n\n- Reproduce the plugin to render **Markdown content**:  \n  https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/blob/main/packages/react-intlayer/src/plugins.tsx  \n  https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/tree/main/packages/react-intlayer/src/markdown\n\n---\n\nContribution guidline :\n\n- Fork + Clone the repo\n- Follow [contributing instruction](https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/tree/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n- Subit your PR\n- Contact for any help (ay.pineau@gmail.com)\n",

This same component is on group pages.\n\nYou can get to an organization page via the following after loading up the Docker containers as described in the [environment setup guide](https://github.com/activist-org/activist?tab=readme-ov-file#environment-setup-):\n- Click `View organizations`\n- Select one of the listed organizations\n- The Connect component is the last one on the About page that you're navigated to\n\nYou can get to a group page via:\n- Selecting `Groups` in the sidebar of the organization About page above\n- Selecting the group that the backend has populated for the organization\n- The Connect component is in the same place on this page\n\nLet us know if you have further questions or if you have ideas for the tests! \uD83D\uDE0A", "@andrewtavis and @mattburnett-repo, I was wondering if this issue was closed. If not can I contribute to this?\n", "Sure thing, @sailanka02 :) Please let us know if you need any support here! :)" ],

I'm not sure if a diff is the best way to go or not (presumably that would go into benchmarking since it would have to be PR vs. Master). \n\nThe easiest way to get a merge in, that could possibly be migrated to benchmarking later, would be to just run the nsys command with appropriate flags, and it will tell you what the most expensive subroutines are. We have some documentation on nsight profiling in the MFC docs `./mfc.sh run <...> --profile` should work I think. But I think that will just create a report file you look at in the GUI.

I disabled Windows search indexing on my Nextcloud directory because windows kept on downloading files I wanted to only keep online every time I searched for something in the parent folder.\n\nThe search function in the Nextcloud tray menu is able to find the desired sub folder, but clicking the folder only opens the containing folder and not the folder itself. This is useless to me because, as said, there are a lot of different folders and the folder names are too similar.\n\nIt looks like Nextcloud just opens the containing folder for folders or files. It would be nice if there was at least a context open to allow opening folder or files.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nOpen folder or file by default and have open containing folder the context menu option, but that risks messing with other people's workflow since open containing folder is the current behavior.",

It seems the goal of this optimization is to simplify the comparisons involving ANY or SOME operators when the left hand is constant and the right side contains a constant that can evaluate the operation to be True.\n\nTo achieve this, I was considering adding a function called FoldAnyWithConst in [fold_constants.opt](https://github.com/ahuangg/cockroach/blob/master/pkg/sql/opt/norm/rules/fold_constants.opt) \n```\n# FoldAnyWithConst simplifies a scalar ANY operation when the left side is constant\n# and the right side contains a constant that can determine the result, like this:\n# 0.1 < ANY (c0, 0.4) can be simplified since 0.1 < 0.4 is True\n[FoldAnyWithConst, Normalize]\n(AnyScalar\n    $left:* & (IsConstValueOrGroupOfConstValues $left)\n    $right:* &\n    (Let\n        ($result $ok):(FoldAnyWithConst (OpName) $left $right) $ok\n    )\n)\n=>\n$result\n```\nthen doing the actual implementation of the function in [fold_constants_funcs.go](https://github.com/ahuangg/cockroach/blob/master/pkg/sql/opt/norm/fold_constants_funcs.go) in a similar fashion to how the other functions are implemented in the file. \n\nPlease let me know what you think, feedback is appreciated.\n", "That sounds like the correct approach to me.\n\nOne thing we'll have to be mindful about is `NULL` values. We should be find as long as we only fold to `true`, and never `false`.\n\n```sql\nSELECT 1 < ANY (2, NULL), 1 < ANY(0, NULL);\n--   ?column? | ?column?\n-- -----------+-----------\n--      t     |   NULL\n-- (1 row)\n```", "Seeing as this issue has been inactive for a month - can this be assigned to me?\n\n@DrewKimball @mgartner ", "Hi @DrewKimball and @rytaft,\n\nI'd like to work on this issue.

Write a brief description of how you will approach the task (without using ChatGPT).\n3. Add your Telegram handler in your application (e.g., in OnlyDust or similar)\n4. Write ETA in your application\n\n\n## What should I do if I have a problem\n1. Try to google it before asking. Googling is taking major part of dev work \n2. If you couldn't find answer your question with Google, text your question to [dev](https://t.me/spotnet_dev/4) group with your question.\n3. Do not send DM to maintainer, it would be better and faster to ask other contributors in chat \n\n\n## How to prepare PR\n1. Check if your code [smell](https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/smells) good\n2. Add `close #<issue number>` to link your issue with your PR\n3. Do not commit changes that are unrelated to your task\n4. Check after you created PR, if you committed everything\n\n\n## Task Description\n1. Set up backend part using this [README.md](https://github.com/djeck1432/spotnet/tree/main/margin/margin_app/README.md)\n2. Don't forget to run [seed data generator](https://github.com/djeck1432/spotnet/blob/main/margin/margin_app/README.md#5-seed-data-generator) to populate DB\n3. We have `/login` frontend route, and your task is to implement login workflow\n4. Use `http://0.0.0.0:8000/api/auth/login` (POST) backend endpoint for admin sign in\n5. On success, make redirect to `/admin/dashboard` route\n6. On error, show appropriate error message to user\n\n*NOTE: Login is working only for admin users, and emails with passwords for admins can be checked in seed data generator logs while running*",

On the frontend, I???ll connect the `/login` page to the `POST http://0.0.0.0:8000/api/auth/login` endpoint, handling responses gracefully. Successful login will redirect users to `/admin/dashboard`, and failed attempts will display clear error messages using the UI???s notification system. I???ll also handle loading and form validation states for a better UX.\n\uD83D\uDCCC Why Me: I???ve worked on similar login flows integrating REST APIs with frontend pages using React, Next.js, and form libraries. I???m confident in handling authentication flows securely and cleanly.\n\uD83D\uDCE8 Telegram: `@laryhill`\n??? ETA: Within 1 day after assignment\n\n\nRecommended by [OnlyDust](https://onlydust.com/) for high-quality and dependable contributions." ],

We have a `/admin/dashboard` route on frontend, and your task is to connect some components of this page to backend API\n4. You have to connect data about **users**, **opened positions**, **liquidated positions**, and **opened orders**\n5. For data fetching, use backend endpoint `http://0.0.0.0:8000/api/dashboard/statistic` with following response:\n```\nusers: int\nopened_positions: int\nliquidated_positions: int\nopened_orders: int\n```",

You can see the directions and placeholders by loading up a Scribe keyboard and then clicking the Scribe key at the top left of the keyboard. From there select a command. Specifically:\n- The translate placeholder needs to have `:` after the `SOURCE_ISO -> TARGET_ISO` part of the placeholder\n- The conjugate placeholder similarly needs `:` after the localized word \"Conjugate\" in the given language\n- The command bar cursor character `???` should be black even if the user hasn't typed anything\n- The horizontal distance between the command bar cursor character and the rest of the text should be reduced\n\n### Contribution\n\nHappy to support with the work here and review when a PR is opened! \uD83D\uDE0A",

I tried different cursor characters  but the space remained or the height was shorter in case of the pipe symbol.\n\n<img width=\"649\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8473d1b6-22cc-49e2-96cf-638d3a4d18b7\" />\n\nTo fix this, I used an EditText with a custom cursor drawable. This resolved the spacing issue.\n\nThe only limitation now is changing the cursor color based on user preferred theme dark/light ??? since setTextCursorDrawable() requires API 29+, but Scribe???s min SDK is 26.\n\nI noticed apps like WhatsApp use a fixed cursor color (green) in both modes. So for now, I???ve set the cursor color to Scribe blue.\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e2e2fa2-2093-4486-8f11-f51a223d9887\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8c9a34d-7467-4e6d-9db3-63392d7a47ec\n\nIs there a better way to handle this?", "Absolutely amazing work, @janiceferns02!

Ideally we'd do the following to finalize this issue:\n- [ ] We'd just have the blue cursor\n- [ ] There would be less spacing overall so that it's `PROMPT: ???` and not `PROMPT:  ???  `\n- [ ] The blue cursor is currently blinking, which it should not\n\nPlease let us know if you have any questions on the above, and thanks for your willingness to take this on! \uD83D\uDE80" ],

      "description" : "Dear authors,\n\nThank you for your significant contributions to diffusion model fine-tuning. I encountered an Out-of-Memory (OOM) error when training a Kontext LoRA on an NVIDIA RTX 4090 (24GB VRAM) with base_model_precision=\"fp8-quanto\", while int8-quanto works correctly.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n??????1. Hardware??????: NVIDIA RTX 4090 (24GB VRAM)\n??????2. Training Setup??????:\n* Kontext LoRA fine-tuning\n* lora_rank=16\n* lora_type=\"standard\"\n* base_model_precision=\"fp8-quanto\" ??? ??????OOM during checkpoint saving??????\n* base_model_precision=\"int8-quanto\" ??? ??????No OOM??????\n\n## Questions\nI have three questions:\n1. Why is fp8-quanto more prone to OOM than int8-quanto???????\n2. Are there any method to deal with the OOM for fp8-quanto training?\n3. ??????Will using INT8-trained LoRA with FP8 inference degrade quality??????? I want to train on FP8 because ??????ComfyUI currently lacks INT8 inference support, necessitating FP8 inference.\n\nThank you for your insights!\n\n## Error Log\nCUDA out of memory.

Update ImportService to process tags from imported activities\n  2. Handle connecting to existing tags and creating new ones (respecting permissions)\n  3. Add support for tags in the import API endpoint\nFor client changes,\n  1. Update ImportActivitiesDialog to fetch available tags\n  2. Add UI for selecting/mapping tags in the import workflow (similar to account handling)\n  3. Add tag parsing to ImportActivitiesService for CSV/JSON imports\n  4. Update template to include tag selector component in the import dialog \n\nThe implementation would mirror how account handling works in the current import flow. Should I apply this or do you have any other suggestions to solve this?", "Sorry, I haven???t been able to focus due to some personal busyness. Good luck @teresper-eth!", "Thanks @gormelof !  @dtslvr  Could you kindly tell me if I should follow this approach ?", "Hi @teresper-eth,\n\nthanks for outlining your approach!\n\nI don't think we need to update the `ImportActivitiesDialog`. The idea is to handle the tag processing entirely on the backend, similar to how it's currently done for accounts during import. So, the client wouldn't need to fetch or map tags explicitly.\n\nThe rest of your plan sounds like the right direction.", "@dtslvr Please give it a look #4771", "@dtslvr, if this development is stale, I can take it over.", "> [@dtslvr](https://github.com/dtslvr), if this development is stale, I can take it over.\n\nThanks for offering to take this over, @csehatt741!\n\nWith the merge of #5201, this issue is ready to pick up.

      "description" : "### Describe the feature\n\nWe should autodetect the availability of `libudev` at build time if the user did not explicitly provide a setting for the [`meson_options.txt`](https://github.com/stefan11111/xserver/blob/master/meson_options.txt) `udev`. The detection should work regardless of the operating system used.\n\n#### Acceptance criterias\n\n1. Running the Meson build checks for the availability of the `libudev` package/headers if the user has not provided a `true` or `false` value for the Meson option`udev`, ideally by `compiler.check_header('libudev.h')`.\n2. Running the Meson build with providing a `true` value for the Meson option `udev` enables the compilation of `udev` support in XLibre.\n  2.1. The same check for the availability of the `libudev` package/headers is run as in the `auto` case and if there is no support for `udev` detected the configuration phase just fails.\n3. Running the Meson build with providing a `false` value for the Meson option `udev` disables the compilation of `udev` support in XLibre completly and no autodetection will be attempted.\n4. The `udev_kms` flag can only be set explicitly to true if the availability of the `libudev` package/headers was detected. Otherwise the build fails.\n5. The `udev_kms` flag is set to `false` on [`'windows', 'darwin', 'netbsd', 'openbsd', 'sunos']` when running the Meson build if the Meson option `udev_kms` was not explicitly specified by the user.\n6. Both Meson options `udev` and `udev_kms` default to `auto` in [`meson_options.txt`].\n\n##### Bonus criterias\n\n7. There is a description for the `udev` option in [`meson_option`](https://github.com/stefan11111/xserver/blob/master/meson_options.txt).\n8. There is a description for the `udev_kms` option in [`meson_option`](https://github.com/stefan11111/xserver/blob/master/meson_options.txt).\n9. The solution works on Apple MacOS and Microsoft Windows too.\n\n### It should be implemented because\n\nAt the moment the \"automatic\" detection of the compilation of the `udev` support in the XLibre Xserver depends on the operating system XLibre is build on. This is more or less guesswork and not really reliable. The better way was to check whether the `udev` library or the `udev` headers exist.\n\n### What are the alternatives?\n\nLeave things as they are but that way we may miss some platforms providing udev support or not.\n\n### Additional context\n\nThis is a follow up of [Microsoft All-in-one Media Keyboard not working on FreeBSD ?? Issue #397 ?? X11Libre/xserver](https://github.com/X11Libre/xserver/issues/397).\n\nPlease also read the comments on:\n* https://github.com/X11Libre/xserver/pull/444#issuecomment-3096878097\n* https://github.com/X11Libre/xserver/pull/471\n\n### Extra fields\n\n- [x] I have checked the existing [issues](https://github.com/X11Libre/xserver/issues)\n- [x] I have read the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/X11Libre/xserver/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n- [ ] I'd like to work on this issue",

Please describe.**\r\nI hate when two screens in the same room displays different temperatures.\r\n\r\nThe problem with thermometers is that if you have 5 different ones, they all will show a different temperature generally speaking... especially in IoT world.\r\n\r\nMy pellet stove provide one and a screen on it. I would like to keep this value as reference and use it as indoor temperature in the NSPanel screensaver.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nAs an OpenHab user, I would like to be able to select an OpenHab device providing a more accurate temperature sensor of my choice rather than relying on the one provided by Sonoff NSPanel. (Same way as what exists for the outdoor temperature, we can provide an Openhab item as source)\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nWe could alternatively define a custom MQTT topic, however I think we should follow the logic already in place which is to select an openhab item, home assistant item.\r\n\r\nProviding a custom MQTT topic would be another feature that we could consider adding globally (also for the outdoor sensor) in the future (other PR).\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nHere is how I plan to integrate this from a UX perspective:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3cb79b25-15e8-4248-be55-3fdc6528fcaf)\r\n\r\n\r\nWDYT?

Triple server with Triple client: works normally, bidirectional streaming is successful.\n     2. gRPC server with gRPC client: works normally, bidirectional streaming is successful.\n     3. Triple server with gRPC client: after about 10 seconds, the client receives a DEADLINE_EXCEEDED error.\n\nAnalysis:\nThis issue is caused by a lack of compatibility between the Dubbo Triple protocol and the gRPC protocol in bidirectional streaming mode. Although both protocols are based on HTTP/2, there are differences in their implementations, which leads to communication failures and timeouts when they are mixed.\n\nConclusion and Suggestion:\nTo avoid this problem, it is recommended to use the same protocol for both the server and the client???either both use Triple, or both use gRPC. Mixing the two protocols is not supported for bidirectional streaming scenarios.\nAdditionally, I noticed that when the protocols are mixed, some data may be exchanged at first, but the connection will eventually time out due to protocol differences.

Edit the file:\n   cognee/modules/retrieval/graph_completion_retriever.py\n\n2. Add a print/log statement:\n\n   Inside the get_context method, find where the triplets are retrieved from the graph and add a line to print or log them before they are processed further.\n\n   ```python\n   # Inside the get_context method of GraphCompletionRetriever\n   ...\n   triplets = await self.get_triplets(query)\n   ...\n   # Add this line to see the raw source data\n   print(\"Retrieved triplets:\", triplets)     # <-- Add this line\n   return await self.resolve_edges_to_text(triplets)\n   ```\n\nThis will log the exact nodes and relationships that are being used as the foundation for the LLM's answer, allowing you to validate the output directly." ],

So, it doesn't have to\r\n                be a Pydantic model, it could be other things, like a `list`, `dict`,\r\n                etc.\r\n\r\n                It will be used for:\r\n\r\n                * Documentation: the generated OpenAPI (and the UI at `/docs`) will\r\n                    show it as the response (JSON Schema).\r\n                * Serialization: you could return an arbitrary object and the\r\n                    `response_model` would be used to serialize that object into the\r\n                    corresponding JSON.\r\n                * Filtering: the JSON sent to the client will only contain the data\r\n                    (fields) defined in the `response_model`. If you returned an object\r\n                    that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does\r\n                    not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have\r\n                    that `password`.\r\n                * Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the\r\n                    `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the\r\n                    corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not\r\n                    valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,\r\n                    so it's an error from the API developer. So, FastAPI will raise an\r\n                    error and return a 500 error code (Internal Server Error).\r\n\r\n                Read more about it in the\r\n                [FastAPI docs for Response Model](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/).\r\n                \"\"\"\r\n            ),\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut even with response_model: nothing in asyncAPI.\r\n\r\nThanks for any tips, even for \"it's not possible\" ;-)\r\n\r\n</div>",

      "description" : "### Summary\n\nC# 8.0 introduced a significant new feature to the language that extends the type system to make a distinction between references that may be null and ones that must not be.\r\nEnabling non-nullability is a radical change, which is why the feature is switched off until we enabled it explicitly\n\n### Why is this needed?\n\nNullability becomes an opt-in feature: a reference will never contain null unless it is explicitly defined as a nullable reference.\r\nEnabling the type system to distinguish between nullable and non-nullable references is going to be a tricky thing to retrofit. C# cannot always guarantee that a non-nullable reference will never contain a null. \r\nHowever, it can make the guarantee if certain constraints hold, and more generally it will significantly reduce the chances of encountering a NullReferenceException even in cases where it cannot absolutely rule this out.\n\n### Which area does this relate to?\n\nGovernance\n\n### Solution\n\nOn each projects .csproj file add inside `PropertyGroup` the new tag `<Nullable>enable</Nullable>`\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n``` xml\r\n<PropertyGroup>\r\n  <Nullable>enable</Nullable>\r\n</PropertyGroup>\r\n\r\n```\n\n### Acknowledgment\n\n- [X] This request meets [Lambda Powertools Tenets](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-lambda-powertools-dotnet/latest/#tenets)",

It says v3.8 to v3.11\n## Expected Behavior\nThe az command should run without generating compatibility warnings.\n## Additional Context\n\nThe Azure CLI upstream project is located at: https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli\nAccording to upstream documentation, Azure CLI depends on Python version 3.8 or above\nThis issue affects user experience when using the Azure CLI in Wolfi environments\n\n## Package Naming Considerations\n\n* Command vs Package Name Mismatch: The executable command is az, but the actual project name is azure-cli (https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli), which can cause confusion for users trying to find or reference the package\n* Discoverability Issues: Users searching for \"azure-cli\" may not easily find the az package, and vice versa, leading to difficulty in package discovery and installation",

I'd like to claim it and work on it.", "Great! ", "Hi @ShravanDeva5327 327, I saw you claimed this good first issue #2166 a couple of weeks ago and were assigned. Are you still actively working on it or planning to submit a PR soon?\n\nI'm also new to open source contributions (currently learning ROS 2 Humble through projects) and looking for my first issue to tackle. This one seems like a perfect fit with the excellent instructions provided by @christophfroehlich .\n\n(Big thanks for putting that detailed guide together, @christophfroehlich ! I've seen your helpful comments and issues around while searching, and it's really encouraging for newcomers.)\n\nIf you've become busy or decided not to pursue this specific issue anymore, @ShravanDeva5327 327, I would be very interested in taking it on.\n\n@christophfroehlich , if #2166 is still being worked on by ShravanDeva5327, or perhaps in addition, if you know of any other similar beginner-friendly tasks or areas within ros2 (or related projects you maintain) where help might be needed, I'd be very grateful for any pointers! I'm eager to contribute.\n\nPlease let me know the status of #2166 when you have a moment. Thanks!", "Hey @ShahazadAbdulla. I did start looking into this issue but ran into some setup problems on my laptop and couldn???t make much progress. On top of that, I got busy with my coursework and unfortunately didn???t get a chance to update here ??? really sorry about that!\n\nPlease feel free to take over this issue. @christophfroehlich, apologies for the delay and any confusion caused.", "Thanks for the update @ShravanDeva5327 327, and no worries at all ??? setup issues and coursework happen! I really appreciate you letting me know.\n\nI'll go ahead and take on this issue now.\n\n@christophfroehlich , could you please assign issue #2166 to me? I'm looking forward to working through the steps you outlined!", "Hi @christophfroehlich \n\nFollowing up on the assignment for #2166: I've successfully set up the environment on Humble, built the code, and modified the RQT plugin (`popup_info.ui` and `controller_manager.py`) to try and fetch the `update_rate` and `is_async` parameters for the selected controller using `call_get_parameters`.\n\nHowever, when testing with the standard `rrbot` demo (`ros2_control_demo_example_1`) on Humble, I found that the `/controller_manager` node does not expose per-controller parameters like `<controller_name>.update_rate` or `<controller_name>.is_async`. The `ros2 param list /controller_manager` output only shows a global `update_rate` parameter and no `is_async` parameter at all.\n\nThis means the RQT plugin cannot fetch the per-controller data as requested on the Humble branch. It also seems to confirm that ShravanDeva327's merged PR #1 (commit ed4ccb0), which addressed this issue previously, likely targeted a different branch (e.g., `master`) where these parameters are available, and the changes haven't been backported to Humble.\n\nGiven this, it seems impossible to complete issue #2166 on the Humble branch as the required data isn't available.\n\nI'm still very eager to contribute! @christophfroehlich, could you perhaps point me towards another \"good first issue\" in `ros2_control` that is suitable for the Humble distribution? or can you help me complete this.\n\nThanks for the guidance through this investigation!", "In general, we only accept new features targeting the master branch. Then we triage to do backports to e.g., humble. I suggest that you establish a suitable workflow for you to develop on rolling branch, for example with the provided docker containers in this repository.", "Hi @christophfroehlich ,\n\nThanks for assigning this issue to me! and Thanks for the advice about targeting the `master`/`rolling` branch for new features and setting up a suitable workflow. BUT While exploring the code and related PRs (like #2126), I discovered that ShravanDeva5327 actually already submitted and merged a PR (referenced as #1 from his fork context, merged commit ed4ccb0 into `master` about 3 weeks ago) that implements exactly this feature (adding update rate and async properties to the RQT GUI, using table columns and the popup tree view).\n\nIt looks like the work for this issue (#2166) is already completed in the codebase on the `master` branch!\n\nCould you please clarify on that matter.\n\nCould you perhaps point me towards what I should do about this or if its already done then could please point me to another \"good first issue\" in `ros2_control` (maybe one targeting `master`/`rolling`) where I could help out?\n\nThanks again!", "There hasn't been any merge w.r.t. to this issue? https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_control/commits/master/rqt_controller_manager/rqt_controller_manager\n~~and I don't find any commit in the fork of ShravanDeva5327 https://github.com/ShahazadAbdulla/ros2_control/commits/master/rqt_controller_manager/rqt_controller_manager~~\n\nCan you clarify what you mean by that?", "Hi @christophfroehlich,\n\nAh, thank you so much for the clarification and for checking the history! My apologies for the confusion. I completely misinterpreted the status of a Pull Request I saw on @ShravanDeva5327's fork specifically, \nhttps://github.com/ShravanDeva5327/ros2_control/pull/1. \nI mistakenly thought the \"Merged\" status there meant it had been merged into `ros-controls/ros2_control`, but I understand now it was likely merged within his own fork's branches.\n\nThanks for confirming that issue #2166 is indeed still open!\n\nI would definitely still like to work on it. Based on your previous advice, I will:\n1. Set up a ROS 2 Rolling development environment (likely using Docker).\n2. Ensure my local fork is up-to-date with the latest `ros-controls/ros2_control` `master` branch.\n3. Create a new feature branch based off `master`.\n4. Implement the changes to add the update rate and async status to the RQT GUI (fetching the parameters as discussed).\n5. Submit a Pull Request targeting the `ros-controls/ros2_control` `master` branch.\n\nDoes that sound like the correct plan? Please let me know if there's anything else I should consider. Thanks again for your patience and guidance!", "Sry, I also had a look in the wrong fork (in yours, instead of that of @ShravanDeva5327). \nThis is a good plan. You can use the commit that you have already found as a starting point, test and improve it. (cherry-pick it, then the original author will be retained)", "Hi @christophfroehlich ,\n\nAh, thanks a million for clearing that up about the fork vs. upstream merge ??? totally my mistake reading that PR status! Appreciate you checking.\n\nGot it. Plan is now:\n1.  Set up a Rolling/Docker dev environment.\n2.  Sync with `upstream/master`.\n3.  Create a new branch.\n4.  `git cherry-pick` @ShravanDeva5327's original commit(s) from his PR ([https://github.com/ShravanDeva5327/ros2_control/pull/1](https://github.com/ShravanDeva5327/ros2_control/pull/1)) as you suggested ??? great idea!\n5.  Test thoroughly on Rolling, fix/improve if needed.\n6.  Submit a new PR targeting `master`, referencing this issue and crediting the original commit.\n\nStarting on the Rolling setup now. Thanks again for steering me right!", "@ShahazadAbdulla Are you still working on it? Or shall I un-assign you, so maybe anyone else can pick this up?", "@christophfroehlich Hello, I am really really sorry, due to some technical and personal reason I completely loose out on this. I have already cloned and everything.

Proposed Solution / Steps to Reproduce\n\nSolution:\n1. Adding a visible disclaimer in the site: \"This is a clone for educational purposes. No real data is collected.\"\n2.

      "url" : "https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/36978",
      "repositoryName" : "huggingface/transformers",
      "description" : "## Community contributions: Add Fast Image Processors\n\nFast image processors have been rolling out progressively for a while. Now that the [BaseImageProcessorFast](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/image_processing_utils_fast.py#L292), from which all fast image processors inherit, is in a more stable state, I'm opening this issue to encourage contributors to add fast image processors for models that still only have a \"slow\" image processor.\n\n### How to implement a Fast Image Processor\n\nThe core principle of fast image processors is to use `torch` and `torchvision` functions for image transformations instead of `PIL` or `numpy`. Among other performance benefits, this enables processing images on GPU, significantly improving inference speed.\n\nAnother key difference compared to slow image processors is that, unlike `BaseImageProcessor`, which provides only a minimal skeleton, `BaseImageProcessorFast` includes all the fundamental functionalities needed for a basic image processor. This allows optimizations made in BaseImageProcessorFast to propagate to its inherited classes. Additionally, most repetitive logic for image loading and argument handling is managed within BaseImageProcessorFast. Except in rare cases, inherited classes do not need to handle image loading, conversion, or retrieving arguments from class attributes in the call/preprocess function, this is all handled in `BaseImageProcessorFast`.\n\n#### Getting Started\n\nRun the following command:\n```bash\ntransformers-cli add-fast-image-processor --model-name model_name\n```\nwhere `model_name` is the name of the model (as found in its folder under `transformers/src/transformers/models`) for which you're adding the fast image processor.\n\nThis command will handle all necessary imports and generate a basic fast image processor, which will look similar to this example for Beit:\n\n```python\n# coding=utf-8\n# Copyright 2025 The HuggingFace Inc. team.

The class attributes, such as `resample` and `image_mean`, are automatically parsed from the slow image processor when running the script above. However, you should verify their correctness and check for any missing or incorrectly assigned values.\n\n### Customizing the Image Processor\n\nIf the image processor requires additional functionalities beyond the basic augmentations, you will need to override the `_preprocess` function in `BaseImageProcessorFast`. Check the `_preprocess` implementation in `BaseImageProcessorFast` for reference. Notably, it leverages `group_images_by_shape` and `reorder_images` to enable batch processing, significantly increasing processing speed, particularly on GPUs. If you create new image processing functions, ensure they support batch processing by utilizing `group_images_by_shape` and `reorder_images` where possible.\n\nIf your image processor requires additional kwargs not present in [`DefaultFastImageProcessorKwargs`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/image_processing_utils_fast.py#L172), you must create a `ModelNameFastImageProcessorKwargs` class that inherits from `DefaultFastImageProcessorKwargs` and defines the new kwargs. Additionally, you should document the added kwargs in the class and the `preprocess` function using `add_start_docstrings`. (This documentation process may be simplified soon, but is necessary for now to get a correct documentation).\n\nFor an example of handling custom kwargs and documentation, refer to [LlavaNextImageProcessorFast](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/models/llava_next/image_processing_llava_next_fast.py).\n\n### Important Notes\n\n- In nearly all cases, `_preprocess` is the only function in `BaseImageProcessorFast` that needs to be overridden.\n- The `_preprocess` function does not require default values for its arguments, as they are automatically derived from class attributes if not explicitly provided.\n- Even if `PIL` images or `numpy` arrays are passed to the image processor, the `images` argument in `_preprocess` will always be a list of tensors, with the channel dimension first.\n\n### Handling Edge Cases\n\n- **Nested Images:** If images are provided as nested lists (e.g., `[[image1, image2], [image3]]`), they will be flattened to `[image1, image2, image3]` by default before being passed to `_preprocess`. This behavior can be modified by overriding `_prepare_images_structure`, though flattening is generally recommended.\n- **Formatting Custom  Kwargs:** If any custom kwargs require formatting before `_preprocess`, override `_further_process_kwargs`.\n- **Validating Custom Kwargs:** If additional validation is needed for custom kwargs or existing ones, override `_validate_preprocess_kwargs`.\n\n### Testing\n\nIn the case where the model already has a `test_image_processing_model_name.py` file under `transformers/tests/models/model_name`, the script ran before should have imported the fast image processor to the file, and added it as a `fast_image_processing_class` class attribute to the `ModelNameImageProcessingTest` class.\nHowever this is not enough to get all the tests to run on the fast image processor. For all the test functions under `ModelNameImageProcessingTest`, you need to replace `image_processing = self.image_processing_class(**self.image_processor_dict)` with a loop over `self.image_processor_list`.\n\nFor example, the `test_image_processor_properties` test in `test_image_processing_beit.py` which looks like this:\n\n```python\n    def test_image_processor_properties(self):\n        image_processing = self.image_processing_class(**self.image_processor_dict)\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"do_resize\"))\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"size\"))\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"do_center_crop\"))\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"center_crop\"))\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"do_normalize\"))\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"image_mean\"))\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"image_std\"))\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"do_reduce_labels\"))\n```\nshould be changed to this:\n\n```python\n    def test_image_processor_properties(self):\n        for image_processing_class in self.image_processor_list:\n            image_processing = image_processing_class(**self.image_processor_dict)\n            self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"do_resize\"))\n            self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"size\"))\n            self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"do_center_crop\"))\n            self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"center_crop\"))\n            self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"do_normalize\"))\n            self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"image_mean\"))\n            self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"image_std\"))\n            self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"do_reduce_labels\"))\n```\n\nIn the case where no image processing test file is present, now is a great time to add one! You can have a look at the[ CLIP image processing test file](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/ad5d40de9c4d4899d5b79243f63e22c72e8b3669/tests/models/clip/test_image_processing_clip.py) to use as a simple starting point.\n\nDon't hesitate to add model-specific tests if you feel like there are some non-standard image processing techniques in the processor :).\n\nTo run the tests, use this command:\n```bash\nRUN_SLOW=1 python -m pytest tests/models/model_name/test_image_processing_model_name.py\n```\n\n\n### Choosing an Image Processor to Implement\n\nThe difficulty of implementing a fast image processor varies by model.

Good task for this week..!", "@edgarriba I love kornia! But for image processors at inference time, it might be a bit overkill since 90% of the time, we only need a mix of resizing, normalizing, padding, and cropping, combined with some model-specific logic. I???ve found that `torch`/`torchvision` functional transforms usually cover these needs well, and pipelines like kornia `ImageSequential` or torchvision `Compose` aren???t always a good fit because some models require additional processing steps or custom logic in between. We also wanted to avoid adding an extra dependency to Transformers for fast image processors.\n\nThat said, I do think kornia could be valuable down the line, especially for batch processing. I'm still exploring how to optimize batch processing performance on both GPU and CPU, and kornia likely handles this more efficiently than our current approach.", "The core of the library is pure functional -- that has been always the scope.

Open a Pull Request against the `foxy-devel` branch and once merged, replace that long and ugly line in this repository to make use of this new function!\r\n\r\n## Instructions\r\nHi, this is a `good-first-issue` issue. This means we've worked to make it more legible to people who either **haven't contributed to our codebase before, or even folks who haven't contributed to open source before**.\r\n\r\nWe're interested in helping you take the first step, and can answer questions and help you out along the way. Note that we're especially interested in contributions from underrepresented groups!\r\n\r\nWe know that creating a pull request is the biggest barrier for new contributors. This issue is for you \uD83D\uDC9D\r\n\r\nIf you have contributed before, **consider leaving this PR for someone new**, and looking through our general [bug](https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_controllers/labels/bug) issues. Thanks!\r\n\r\n### \uD83E\uDD14 What you will need to know.\r\n\r\nNothing. This issue is meant to welcome you to Open Source :) We are happy to walk you through the process.\r\n\r\n### \uD83D\uDCCB Step by Step\r\n\r\n- [ ] \uD83D\uDE4B **Claim this issue**: Comment below. If someone else has claimed it, ask if they've opened a pull request already and if they're stuck -- maybe you can help them solve a problem or move it along!\r\n\r\n- [ ] \uD83D\uDDC4??? **Create a local workspace** for making your changes and testing [following these instructions](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials/Workspace/Creating-A-Workspace.html), for Step3 use \"Download Source Code\" section with [these instructions](https://ros-controls.github.io/control.ros.org/getting_started.html#compiling).\r\n\r\n- [ ] \uD83C\uDF74 **Fork the repository** using the handy button at the top of the repository page and **clone** it into `~/ws_ros2_control/src/ros-controls/ros2_controllers`, [here is a guide that you can follow](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) (You will have to remove or empty the existing `ros2_controllers` folder before cloning your own fork)\r\n\r\n- [ ] **Checkout a new branch** using `git checkout -b <branch_name>`\r\n\r\n- [ ] \uD83E\uDD16 **Apply `pre-commit`** auto formatting, by running `pip3 install pre-commit` and running `pre-commit install` in the ros2_control repo.\r\n\r\n- [ ] \uD83D\uDCBE **Commit and Push** your changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] \uD83D\uDD00 **Start a Pull Request** to request to merge your code into `master`. There are two ways that you can start a pull request:\r\n1. If you are not familiar with GitHub or how to create a pull request, [here is a guide you can follow](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) on how GitHub works.\r\n\r\n- [ ] \uD83C\uDFC1 **Done** Ask in comments for a review :)\r\n\r\n### Is someone else already working on this?\r\n\r\n\uD83D\uDD17- We encourage contributors to link to the original issue in their pull request so all users can easily see if someone's already started on it.\r\n\r\n\uD83D\uDC65- **If someone seems stuck, offer them some help!**\r\n\r\n### \uD83E\uDD14??? Questions?\r\n\r\nDon???t hesitate to ask questions or to get help if you feel like you are getting stuck. For example leave a comment below!\r\nFurthermore, you find helpful resources here:\r\n* [ROS2 Control Contribution Guide](https://ros-controls.github.io/control.ros.org/contributing.html)\r\n* [ROS2 Tutorials](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials.html)\r\n* [ROS Answers](https://answers.ros.org/questions/)\r\n\r\n**Good luck with your first issue!**\r\n",

However, we notice that there was no notifications being sent to the Slack channel that was set up and we found this error:\n\n<img width=\"1920\" height=\"240\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4ba580f-dfe8-45df-87ec-716ea2f5693b\" />\n\n\nWe assumed that this error meant that this.app isn???t assigned in the following code block, and that when the program tries to read the properties of .client it gives the error.\n<img width=\"459\" height=\"136\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7632d3b7-96a2-496e-832a-a01c90ca1f6c\" />\n\nWe found that this value is supposed to be defined in the constructor, but that because of the if statement, it was never being defined. We tried to force it to run by removing the if statement to run, but we got the following error below because this.integration is undefined at the time of the constructor running.\n\n<img width=\"509\" height=\"260\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/985bddd2-fc10-4aff-a37e-e5ca40f03718\" />\n\n\n**Error caused by removing the if statement in the constructor**\n<img width=\"1463\" height=\"103\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6c0c4e4-57c1-4e80-9cbd-5cec294b373a\" />\n\nTo try and fix this, we moved the entire if statement into the init() function, since the init function is run in the integration.service file after the IntegrationFactory.createIntegration() function that sets the value of this.integration. After doing this, the if statement does pass, but we get the following error stating that the decryptMetadata function is receiving an object instead of a Buffer, ArrayBuffer, Array, or Array-like Object.\n\n**Error caused by moving the entire if statement out of the constructor to the init() function so that it runs after integration is defined**\n<img width=\"1969\" height=\"335\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50b1ba90-8c55-4e33-a8b3-005ea42467d7\" />\n\nWe wanted to reach out and see if this error is something on our side only or if the Slack integration is not working right now, because we won???t be able to test if our new init() function is working without the integration set up. If this is a known problem or if you have any advice about how to fix it, please let us know.\n", "For the error with client, you can check `vercel.integration.ts`. It uses a `getVercelClient` that doesnt depend on constructors. The issue with decryption, i dont' see anything wrong with the currect codebase. Perhaps I will have more clarity if i could see your code." ],

      "description" : "**Issue ID:** #109\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDC1E **Current Issue**\n\nThe login and registration pages for both **Users** and **Admins** are built, but:\n\n* \uD83D\uDEAB Registration data is **not being stored** in the MongoDB database.\n* \uD83D\uDD01 Users/Admins are able to **register again with same credentials** ??? no duplicate check.\n* \uD83D\uDE36 Logging in with registered credentials **doesn't fetch previous users**.\n* \uD83D\uDD10 There's **no session-based or role-based redirection** (e.g., admin should not land on user dashboard).\n* \uD83D\uDCAC No **email notification** is sent on successful registration, which reduces user onboarding quality.\n* \uD83E\uDD1D Admin and User routes are not **fully separated or protected**.\n\n---\n\n### \uD83C\uDFAF **Expected Fix + Features To Be Implemented**\n\n---\n\n#### ??? 1. \uD83D\uDD10 **Secure Registration & Login with MongoDB**\n\n* Save user and admin credentials in **MongoDB Atlas** using Mongoose models.\n* Use **bcrypt** to hash passwords before saving.\n* Structure example:\n\n```js\n{\n  name: \"John Doe\",\n  email: \"john@example.com\",\n  password: \"hashed_pw\",\n  role: \"user\", // or \"admin\"\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n#### ??? 2. ??? Prevent Duplicate Registration\n\n* During registration:\n\n  * Check if email already exists.\n  * If it does, return message like:\n    `\"User already exists. Please login instead.\"`\n\n---\n\n#### ??? 3. \uD83D\uDD10 JWT Authentication & Protected Routes\n\n* On successful login, generate a **JWT token**.\n* Store token in `localStorage` (Frontend).\n* Protect routes like:\n\n  * `/admin/*` only for admins\n  * `/user/*` only for users\n* Auto-redirect based on role after login.\n\n---\n\n#### ??? 4. \uD83D\uDCE7 **Signup Flow ??? Auto Welcome Mail + Reset Option**\n\nEvery time a user or admin signs up, trigger an **automated welcome email**.\n\n* Email includes:\n\n  * Username\n  * Default password (admin only)\n  * Friendly greeting\n  * Reset password option (via link or email instruction)\n\n* ??? Email Integration Details:\n\n  ```js\n  my_email = \"nicdelhi2024@gmail.com\"\n  app_password = \"zuff vkvx pamt kdor\" // Use SMTP via Gmail app password\n  ```\n\n* Use **nodemailer** in backend to send mails securely.\n\n---\n\n#### ??? 5. \uD83D\uDCBE **Database Connection ??? MongoDB Atlas**\n\n* Store:\n\n  * All credentials (safely hashed)\n  * Email logs (optional)\n* Setup MongoDB URI in `.env`:\n\n```\nMONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.0khgj.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0\n```\n\n---\n\n#### ??? 6. \uD83D\uDD01 **Auto-Login If User Already Exists**\n\n* If an already registered user tries to re-register, auto-detect and:\n\n  * Send them to login page.\n  * Or, directly log in if credentials match.\n\n---\n\n### \uD83E\uDDEA Testing Requirements\n\n* ??? Register user/admin ??? should appear in MongoDB\n* ??? Duplicate registration ??? error message\n* ??? Login ??? JWT issued, dashboard redirect\n* ??? Signup ??? welcome mail received\n* ??? Token-based route protection works\n* ??? Admin routes cannot be accessed by normal users\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDCCC Final Notes\n\nThis issue is **critical to fully enable the authentication system** of the platform and onboard users professionally with mail + data storage setup.\n\nGSSoC contributors can take this issue by:\n\n* Commenting your approach clearly\n* Using clean, modular code\n* Keeping existing code untouched ??? **Do not remove or break current pages**\n* Ensure proper environment variable handling for emails and database\n",

Low contrast can make text difficult to read, reducing usability and accessibility for all users, including those using assistive technologies.\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ]  All text elements meet WCAG 2 AA contrast guidelines.\n- [ ]  Interactive elements (buttons, links, form fields) have sufficient contrast.\n- [ ]  Updates are tested and verified using accessibility tools.\n\n### Resources\n- [Color Contrast Anaylzer](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.10/color-contrast?application=AxeChrome)\n- [WCAG Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/)\n- [Silktide](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/silktide-accessibility-ch/mpobacholfblmnpnfbiomjkecoojakah?hl=en)\n- [Axe Dev Tools](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/axe-devtools-web-accessib/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd?hl=en)\n- [WAVE](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/wave-evaluation-tool/jbbplnpkjmmeebjpijfedlgcdilocofh?hl=en)",

From what I understand, this is likely because no tests have been created yet.\n\nJust to be sure, am I expected to manually create the required package structure and test files (SettingsScreenUnitTest.kt and SettingsScreenInstrumentedTest.kt) as suggested in the issue description? Once I get your go-ahead, I???ll proceed with setting them up and start adding the tests.\n\nThank you \uD83D\uDE0A", "Hey @majidhawa\n\nSorry, we were not able to get to you earlier. You would now see the android tests folder structure created in the directory as instrumentation tests are added for the project. If there are no specific tests for any package you could create the package and the subdirectories and then create the files under them for the tests. \n\nThanks for the efforts @majidhawa \uD83D\uDE04 \n", "Thanks so much for the clarification, @angrezichatterbox \uD83D\uDE0A\n\nThat makes perfect sense now. I actually figured it out shortly after and went ahead to manually create the required package structure for both unit and instrumented tests as suggested.\n\nHere???s how I organized the test directories:\n`app/\n      src/\n         test/\n    java/be/scri/ui/screens/settings/SettingsScreenUnitTest.kt\n         androidTest/\n                  java/be/scri/ui/screens/settings/SettingsScreenInstrumentedTest.kt\n`\nWhile setting this up, I initially ran into some issues related to the JDK configuration. Gradle was trying to use Java 21, which didn???t have the required compiler tools, so the tests wouldn???t run. I resolved it by switching to Java 17 and explicitly pointing Gradle to the correct JDK path.\n\nAfter that, I was able to successfully run the unit tests for the Dimensions object. I???m now working on the instrumented tests for SettingsScreen, focusing on Compose UI rendering and ViewModel state handling.\n\nI???ll continue pushing forward and will reach out if anything else comes up. Thanks again for the support.", "Hey hey @majidhawa \uD83D\uDC4B Quick check in to see if you need any support with the work for this issue :) Please let us know if there's anything we can do to support!", "Hey @andrewtavis , Thanks for checking in. I was able to set up the required package structure and got the unit tests for the Dimensions object running successfully. However, I ran into a bit of a blocker with the instrumented tests.\n\nWhen I run all tests together (e.g., using ???Run Tests???), things seem to work fine. But when I try running the instrumented test file individually (SettingsScreenInstrumentedTest.kt), it throws errors. I suspect this might be due to how the test files or dependencies are organized.\n\nI noticed someone else raised a similar concern in the group, so I???m waiting for tomorrow???s meeting to get more clarity and confirm whether I???ve set up everything correctly. Once I???m sure about the structure, I???ll continue with the remaining tests.\n\nThanks again for the support.\n", "@angrezichatterbox  I would like to work on this issue", "I would also like to work on this", "Thanks @navaneeth0041 and @AtharvaNair04 for picking this up!" ],

      "description" : "Currently, all of the network connectivity types that talk to dBus via the `zbus` crate (Avahi, resolved, BlueZ, wpa_supplicant in #279, and likely NetworkManager in future) do register resources in dBus that need to be deregistered when their type (= say, WpaSupp) is dropped.\n\nSince all of zbus is async and rs-matter itself is async, this poses a challenge because calling async methods from a `drop fn` needs to block, which - while working - is not ideal.\n\nHowever extending a bunch of rs-matter traits, like - say - `NetCtl` with an explicit `async fn close` that the user has to call explicitly is not ideal either, as it just offloads the problem to the shoulders of the user, and then creates problems downstream in crates like `rs-matter-stack` and `rs-matter-embassy` which now - somehow and in turn - need to deal with this `async fn close` and somehow call it - even though their own futures practice the \"cancel on drop\" pattern as well.\n\nPerhaps an easier approach would be to double-check that:\n- dBus deregisters everything regsitered on behalf of a dBus connection (= zbus async `Connection`), once the UDS socket of that connection is closed\n- dbus `Connection` is closing its UDS socket on drop (should be the case anyway, as that's the default for every STD socket, sync or async)\n\n... and then just change the existing code to require an \"owned\" connection, rather than taking a connection reference. So that when - say - the future owning the `WpaSupp` instance is dropped, the `WpaSupp` instance itself is dropped, and so is its connection and therefore - all dBus objects registered by `WpaSupp` as well.",

      "url" : "https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/issues/30260",
      "repositoryName" : "openvinotoolkit/openvino",
      "description" : "### Context\n\n[JIT Emitters](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/emitters/README.md) are part of code generation feature (a.k.a. tensor compiler) that automatically produces highly-efficient optimized fused subgraph binary code. Each emitter implements specific operation from low level OpenVINO dialect.\n\n### Prerequisites\nDue to limited resources, cross compilation is preferred option now for building OpenVINO targeting RISC-V development boards. Please see the documentation [\"Cross compile OpenVINO??? Runtime for RISCV64 systems\"](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/docs/dev/build_riscv64.md) for more details. For this work, you need to build [`xuantie-gnu-toolchain`](https://github.com/XUANTIE-RV/) or [`riscv-gnu-toolchain`](https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain.git) with `QEMU` support for emulation. So you don't need to have RISC-V development board even to contribute to OpenVINO for these platforms \uD83D\uDE03 \n\n### What needs to be done?\n\n* Create `fp32` [SquaredDifference](https://docs.openvino.ai/2025/documentation/openvino-ir-format/operation-sets/operation-specs/arithmetic/squared-difference-1.html) operation [JIT Emitter](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/emitters/plugin/riscv64/jit_eltwise_emitters.hpp) for RISCV64 platform with RVV1.0 support. Use OpenVINO [CPU plugin JIT emitters](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/emitters/README.md) documentation and [RISC-V \"V\" Vector Extension](https://github.com/riscvarchive/riscv-v-spec/releases/tag/v1.0) documentation for details.\n* Support your implemented JIT Emitter in the [JIT Executor](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/4ebe493140b90cbaaa68e2c71fe8e1dbd7461822/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/nodes/eltwise.cpp#L805).\n* Modify [RISCV64 kernel](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/4ebe493140b90cbaaa68e2c71fe8e1dbd7461822/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/nodes/kernels/riscv64/jit_uni_eltwise_generic.hpp#L19) (in both places: [create_eltwise_emitter](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/4ebe493140b90cbaaa68e2c71fe8e1dbd7461822/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/nodes/kernels/riscv64/jit_uni_eltwise_generic.cpp#L401) and [get_supported_precisions](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/4ebe493140b90cbaaa68e2c71fe8e1dbd7461822/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/nodes/kernels/riscv64/jit_uni_eltwise_generic.cpp#L528)) to apply developed JIT emitter.\n\nBefore emitter implementation, please, modify tests to be sure that developed functionality is covered by test:\n * Add `jit` kernel check in [eltwise](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/0a177ff48a7197bee7eeb08f4e81b9d0ce8db271/src/plugins/intel_cpu/tests/functional/custom/single_layer_tests/classes/eltwise.cpp#L291) test, the test must fail.\n* If test doesn't fail then add supported operation in [CPU eltwise test instantiation](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/0a177ff48a7197bee7eeb08f4e81b9d0ce8db271/src/plugins/intel_cpu/tests/functional/custom/single_layer_tests/classes/eltwise.cpp#L338) if it's absent.\n\n### Tests\nTests are disabled in default build, so ensure to add `-DENABLE_TESTS=ON` into cmake command during the project configuration.\n\n[GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest) is used for testing. CPU functional test target is [ov_cpu_func_tests](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/tree/master/src/plugins/intel_cpu/tests/functional). You can use `GoogleTest` filter:\n```sh\n# If you use xuantie-gnu-toolchain:\n<xuantie_install_path>/bin/qemu-riscv64 -cpu rv64,x-v=true,vext_spec=v1.0 ./bin/[platform]/[build_type]/ov_cpu_func_tests --gtest_filter=\"*smoke*Eltwise*SqDiff*\"\n\n# If you use riscv-gnu-toolchain:\n<riscv_install_path>/bin/qemu-riscv64 -cpu rv64,v=true,vext_spec=v1.0 ./bin/[platform]/[build_type]/ov_cpu_func_tests --gtest_filter=\"*smoke*Eltwise*SqDiff*\"\n```\n\n### Example Pull Requests\n\n* [Abs](https://docs.openvino.ai/2025/documentation/openvino-ir-format/operation-sets/operation-specs/arithmetic/abs-1.html) operation: https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/pull/30218\n\n\n### Resources\n\n- [Contribution guide - start here!](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n- [What is OpenVINO?](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino#what-is-openvino-toolkit)\n- [CPU plugin JIT emitters](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/emitters/README.md)\n- [Blog post on contributing to OpenVINO](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n- [User documentation](https://docs.openvino.ai/)\n- [Intel DevHub Discord channel](https://discord.gg/7pVRxUwdWG) - engage in discussions, ask questions and talk to OpenVINO developers\n- [How to link your Pull Request to an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#manually-linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-the-pull-request-sidebar)\n-  [\"Cross compile OpenVINO???

This is also something that could be addressed in #194 since a dev could then customize the server setup more easily.\n\n**To Reproduce**\n```python\nfrom urllib.parse import urljoin\n\nurl = \"http://localhost:8000/some/path/to/sse\"\nsse_data = \"/messages/?session_id=123\"\n\nendpoint_url = urljoin(url, sse_data)\nassert endpoint_url == \"http://localhost:8000/messages/?session_id=123\"\n\n####\n\nurl = \"http://localhost:8000/some/path/to/sse\"\nsse_data = \"messages/?session_id=123\"\n\nendpoint_url = urljoin(url, sse_data)\nassert endpoint_url == \"http://localhost:8000/some/path/to/messages/?session_id=123\"\n```\n\n**Expected behavior**\nA clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.\n I would expect this to join the route to the end of the url instead of truncating it.\n\n",

Which problem is? \n           Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...] )-->\nSometimes when looking for something comfy to rewatch, or just browsing/gathering videos for a queue or playlist, I can't remember when I last watched something. \n\n??? _SOLUTION_:    \n<!-- (Describe what you'd like \n          (A clear and concise description of what you want to happen). \n           Please consider screenshots or sketches if it makes sense)-->\nA small text overlay tucked in the corner of thumbnails, displayed on mouse-over, telling you when you last watched the video, if watch history data is available of course, eg. \"Last watched 5s ago\"\nSettings could include a toggle for relative/exact date and time, preferred corner, text size/opacity etc.\nAlso, and this is probably not likely to be fair, maybe watch history could be imported locally from the users /youtube/google account, as a one-time supplement to the extensions watch tracker.\n\n ??? _ALTERNATIVES_: \n<!-- (Describe what you've considered: \n      Alternative solutions or features, you'd consider as equal or inferior). -->\nCan't think of any. \n\n ??? _RELEVANCE / SCOPE_: \n<!-- (Would this be good by for everybody by default? (hypothetically). \n          Estimate how many percent of our users (or all youtube users) should/would use your idea? ) -->\nA bunch of people will probably think it's redundant clutter or unnecessary information to be given and disable it/not enable it, so having it be opt-in is probably better. At the same time, I suspect that those who try it will wonder where it was all their life.\n\n??? _\"SIDE EFFECTS\"_:   \n<!-- (Is there any conflict with any other feature? \n           Who might NOT want this?(How many percent of users could be bothered by it even filling space in our menu?)--> \nIf implemented just as a thumbnail overlay without appearance settings/options for displaying it somewhere else, the overlay might feel like it's in the way for 40-50% of average users, maybe more.

Thank you very much for all you work!\r\n\r\nHowever, now I tried to setup a kopia server and there are some things I missed at https://kopia.io/docs/repository-server/ so these points could be improved. (I might provide a PR for the documentation ... once I understand the details ... :smiley:)\r\n\r\n* Explain the process of setting up a kopia server\r\n  * Explain requirements to run a server\r\n  * `kopia server start`, link to https://kopia.io/docs/reference/command-line/common/server-start/\r\n  * Explain TLS setup (*)\r\n  * Remember to open the port in case a firewall is used (e.g. on linux with ufw using: `sudo ufw allow 51515 comment 'kopia server via https'`)\r\n  * Create user accounts\r\n  * Will the server start automatically on machine boot (e.g. register a service)? Or do I need to do this myself?\r\n* It seems that `kopia server start` does not start the server in the background, but instead provides the server itself. I did expect it otherwise, so it might be mentioned. I guess now, the server won't be started automatically then, right?\r\n* what does `kopia server snapshot` (cancel / pause / resume) do? I don't understand the explanation on https://kopia.io/docs/reference/command-line/common/server-snapshot/\r\n\r\n(*) Could it be that the headings level got messed up? It looks like \"Auto-Generated TLS Certificate\" is a sub heading of \"Configuring Allowed Users - Kopia v0.7\":\r\n\r\n* [Configuring Allowed Users - Kopia v0.8](https://kopia.io/docs/repository-server/#configuring-allowed-users---kopia-v08)\r\n* [Configuring Allowed Users - Kopia v0.7](https://kopia.io/docs/repository-server/#configuring-allowed-users---kopia-v07)\r\n  * [Auto-Generated TLS Certificate](https://kopia.io/docs/repository-server/#auto-generated-tls-certificate)\r\n  * ...\r\n\r\nBut when I read more carefully, it talks about kopia v0.8 as well, so I guess there is a top level heading missing?\r\n\r\n-----\r\nSome more experiences during my first steps, as hints how the documentation could be improved:\r\n\r\nHow can I print the fingerprint again in case I missed to write it down when it was created?\r\n\r\nOnce I started a kopia server, I try to connect (on server machine):\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ kopia server status --server-cert-fingerprint xxx\r\nkopia: error: unable to list sources: 400 Bad Request, try --help\r\n```\r\nThis error message is not really helpful and should at least be explained.\r\nBut when connection from a remote machine this **did** work:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ kopia repository connect server --url https://<server>:51515 --server-cert-fingerprint xxx\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I try to get the server status from a remote machine, this fails as well:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ kopia server status --address https://<server>:51515 --server-cert-fingerprint xxx\r\nkopia: error: unable to list sources: 401 Unauthorized, try --help\r\n```\r\n\r\n(BTW: Seems to be inconsistent to use `--address` here and `--url` at other places. Or does it have different semantics?)\r\n\r\nAlso, when I try to open the server web UI in a browser, the credentials I created before using `kopia server user add` are not accepted.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWhen I try to sync a local repo to the server I also get an error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ kopia repository sync-to server --url https://<server>:51515 --server-cert-fingerprint xxx\r\nkopia: error: expected command but got \"server\", try --help\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs syncing to a server not supported or did I miss something here? It did work when I tried `filesystem` or `sftp`.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n$ kopia --version\r\n0.10.7 build: 5d87d817335f6d547e094ab80062113dc3a1fdf4 from: kopia/kopia",

This is the \"cleaned up\" fingerprint of the TLS certificate:\r\n\r\n`openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -sha256 -in <public.crt> | sed 's/://g' | cut -f 2 -d =`", "I think the problem here goes beyond just documentation. The server seems to be variously broken and/or very problematic to work with. I've spent the last couple of days beating my head against the server with the following results:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIt's confusing that some `server` commands accept control params for directly accessing a remote server (also noting the inconsistent use of the params `--url` and `--address` accross various subcommands, as above), whereas others do not, and appear to require connecting to a repository before they can be used. This can maybe be aided by documentation, but the CLI would be much more usable if all server operations were implemented on the control API, or alternatively (and much less preferably), operations that actually operate on the respository were put under a nested subcommand, ie `server repository users list` or something.\r\n\r\n---\r\n \r\n- The `server status` command on the host does not work, always returns `400 Bad Request`.\r\n- The `server status` command executed remotely, using the correct control username and password returns `400 Bad Request`\r\n- The `server status` command specifies that it reads the env vars `KOPIA_SERVER_USERNAME` and `KOPIA_SERVER_PASSWORD` as the values for the args `--server-control-username` and `--server-control-password` respectively, however the variables for the control user when starting the server are `KOPIA_CONTROL_USER` and `KOPIA_CONTROL_PASSWORD`, resulting in conflicts for configuration via env.\r\n- The KOPIA_CONTROL_USER variable name is inconsistent with the KOPIA_SERVER_USER*NAME* variable name (and the latter format should be preferred as it's consistent with the argument names `--server-control-username`/`--server-username`).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n- The `server refresh` command on the host does not work, always returns `400 Bad Request`.\r\n- The `server refresh` command executed remotely, using the correct control username and password returns `400 Bad Request`\r\n- The `server refresh` command specifies that it reads the env vars `KOPIA_SERVER_USERNAME` and `KOPIA_SERVER_PASSWORD` as the values for the args `--server-control-username` and `--server-control-password` respectively, however the variables for the control user when starting the server are `KOPIA_CONTROL_USER` and `KOPIA_CONTROL_PASSWORD`, resulting in conflicts for configuration via env.\r\n- The KOPIA_CONTROL_USER variable name is inconsistent with the KOPIA_SERVER_USER*NAME* variable name (and the latter format should be preferred as it's consistent with the argument names `--server-control-username`/`--server-username`).\r\n\r\nIt's possible all the control-api commands produce these results, but the above two are the ones that I tested.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI could not find any way to get both the CLI and the server to see that they're connected to a repository other than to first create the repository from the CLI (e.g. `kopia respository create ...`), then to log into the server web UI and connect the repository from there too. This is quite confusing - is the server not using the same configs as the CLI or something?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAfter creating a user via `kopia server users add user@host`, connecting to the repository on a client `kopia repository connect server ...`, and receiving the expected response:\r\n\r\n```\r\nConnecting to server 'https://127.0.0.1:51515' as 'user@host'...\r\nConnected to repository API Server.\r\n\r\nNOTICE: Kopia will check for updates on GitHub every 7 days, starting 24 hours after first use.\r\nTo disable this behavior, set environment variable KOPIA_CHECK_FOR_UPDATES=false\r\nAlternatively you can remove the file \"/home/user/.config/kopia/repository.config.update-info.json\".\r\n```\r\n\r\nNo repository commands work:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ kopia snapshot create /home/user/tmp\r\nERROR failed to open repository: unable to establish session for purpose=: error establishing session: unable to initialize session: rpc error: code = PermissionDenied desc = access denied for user@host: EOF\r\nERROR open repository: unable to open repository: unable to establish session for purpose=: error establishing session: unable to initialize session: rpc error: code = PermissionDenied desc = access denied for user@host: EOF\r\n$ kopia snapshot list\r\nERROR failed to open repository: unable to establish session for purpose=: error establishing session: unable to initialize session: rpc error: code = PermissionDenied desc = access denied for user@host: EOF\r\nERROR open repository: unable to open repository: unable to establish session for purpose=: error establishing session: unable to initialize session: rpc error: code = PermissionDenied desc = access denied for user@host: EOF\r\n$ kopia repository status\r\nERROR failed to open repository: unable to establish session for purpose=: error establishing session: unable to initialize session: rpc error: code = PermissionDenied desc = access denied for user@host: EOF\r\nERROR open repository: unable to open repository: unable to establish session for purpose=: error establishing session: unable to initialize session: rpc error: code = PermissionDenied desc = access denied for user@host: EOF\r\n```\r\n\r\nMaybe this is because the `server refresh` command is broken and can't be executed, however restarting the server also has no impact, and `repository connect` succeeds so I suspect this is a more fundamental problem.\r\n\r\nI tried enabling ACLs but they made no difference.\r\n\r\n---\r\nSo my steps to this point, performed on Kopia v0.13.0 (I'm doing dev locally, so the server host here is a docker container, but AFAICT this is all equally valid for a hand-rolled server install):\r\n1. On server host, bring up server via `kopia server start ...`\r\n2. On server host, create local repository via `kopia repository create filesystem ...`\r\n3. On server Web UI, connect local repository\r\n4. On server host, create a user via `kopia server users add ...`\r\n5. On client, connect repository via `kopia repository connect ...`\r\n6. Fail\r\n\r\nAt this point I think I've exhausted all the options I can find as a user, without putting my dev hat on and going to try to hack the code. It doesn't help that the `debug` log level rarely seems to output anything more than the `info` level, which outputs the bare minimum - decent logging would probably make diagnosing this stuff vastly easier.", "Also some UX adjustments would be nice. For example `kopia server users add User@Host` will gladly prompt for a password, twice, only to stop you with\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ kopia server users add User@Host\r\nEnter new password for user User@Host:\r\nRe-enter new password for verification:\r\nERROR error setting user profile: username must be specified as lowercase 'user@hostname'\r\n```\r\n\r\nSame happens with `kopia repository connect server --url=http://somehost:51515`. It validates arguments only after prompting for credentials.\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ kopia repository connect server --url=http://localhost:51515\r\nConnecting to server 'http://localhost:51515' as 'username@hostname'...\r\nEnter password to open repository:\r\n\r\nERROR failed to open repository: invalid server address, must be 'https://host:port'\r\nERROR error connecting to API server: invalid server address, must be 'https://host:port'\r\n```\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs a side question: is there a reason why Kopia connects to the repository server over HTTPS only? I've seen a generic \"due to gRPC\" answer [here](https://kopia.discourse.group/t/cant-connect-to-insecure-repository-server/871/3), but no further explanation. There was an issue about the same topic, but it went stale: #1215. A quick google search reveals that gRPC can work over plain HTTP. See e.g. grpc/grpc-go#555", "I want to report that I am also experiencing \"permission denied\" errors when connecting to a Kopia server over TLS.

Hopefully you will find it useful. I ran it on my machines three times, so it shouldn't have technical mistakes. But English is not my first language, so I probably have some weird wording here and there.\n\n---\n\n# Kopia repository server tutorial\n\nThis tutorial shows how to start Kopia as a repository server and how to connect to this repository. It assumes you use a bash-like shell and have Kopia installed and available in your `$PATH`. It also suggest using [`step`](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/index.html) or `openssl` utility for TLS certificates management.\n\nIn this tutorial you will encounter some strings prefixed with `PWGN-`. They are credentials and provided here in readable and descriptive form to help you see which password goes where, but in real-life use-cases you will need to use password generators for those.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nCreate a directory for this tutorial in your favorite location.\n\n```bash\nmkdir /tmp/kopia-server-tutorial\n```\n\nStart two shells, e.g. using `tmux` panes, or two terminal emulators.\n\nYou can optionally modify the prompt line to help distinguish between them\n\n```bash\nexport PS1='server$ '\ncd /tmp/kopia-server-tutorial\n```\n\n```bash\nexport PS1='client$ '\ncd /tmp/kopia-server-tutorial\n```\n\n## Server side setup\n\nSet environment variables for the repository.\n\n```bash\nexport KOPIA_CONFIG_PATH=\"$PWD/upstream-repository.config\"\nexport KOPIA_PASSWORD=PWGN-upstream-password\nexport KOPIA_SERVER_PASSWORD=PWGN-kopia-server-password\n```\n\nThe repository that the server will be using can be of any type. In this example we will use `filesystem` type repository.\n\n```bash\nmkdir repository-filesystem\nkopia repository create filesystem --path=\"$PWD/repository-filesystem\"\n```\n\nNext create the certificate. There are many possible ways to do this. For testing, we can use `step`.\n\n```bash\nstep certificate create \"localhost\" cert_kopia.pem cert_kopia_key --profile self-signed --subtle --no-password --insecure --not-after 24h\n```\n\nTake a note of the fingerprint. It will be needed later.\n\n```bash\nstep certificate fingerprint < cert_kopia.pem\n```\n\nTo before starting the server we need to add users. Remember that username needs to follow `username@hostname` pattern, without uppercase letters.\n\n```bash\nkopia server users add first@localhost --user-password PWGN-userpassword\nkopia server users list\n```\n\nFinally we can start our server.\n\n```bash\nkopia server start --tls-cert-file cert_kopia.pem --tls-key-file cert_kopia_key --address \"https://127.0.0.1:12345\"\n```\n\nYou should be able to visit the server's WebUI in browser. It will likely warn you about the use of self-signed certificate, which you can dismiss. Use `kopia` as username and `PWGN-kopia-server-password` as password.\n\n### Notes\n\n- Here we use port `12345`. If this port is already in use, you can use a different one.\n- In production you will likely have to use `0.0.0.0` to make this server available over network.\n- This example uses a short-lived certificate, that expires after one day. In production you can choose to create a long-living certificate or use a Certificate Authority, private or public.\n\nIf you don't want to use `step`, you can use `openssl`. To generate temporary certificate:\n\n```bash\nopenssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -out param.pem ; openssl req -x509 -newkey ec:param.pem -keyout cert_kopia_key -out cert_kopia.pem -sha256 -days 1 -nodes -subj \"/CN=localhost\" ; rm param.pem\n```\n\nTo get the fingerprint:\n\n```bash\nopenssl x509 -in cert_kopia.pem -noout -fingerprint -sha256 | sed 's/://g' | cut -f 2 -d =\n```\n\n## Client side setup\n\nAgain, start with environment variables for Kopia. Note that we use the same password that we used with `kopia server users add` command as a repository password.\n\n```bash\nexport KOPIA_CONFIG_PATH=\"$PWD/user-side.config\"\nexport KOPIA_PASSWORD=PWGN-userpassword\n```\n\nAlso bring the fingerprint of server certificate to the client.\n\n```bash\nFINGERPRINT=\"1497bfdb2ce6ec97b71f19b579bc0dc8651241d4e68b38993d7078f02fa28184\"\n```\n\nConnect to server.\n\n```bash\nkopia repo connect server --url https://localhost:12345 --server-cert-fingerprint \"$FINGERPRINT\" --override-username first --override-hostname localhost\n```\n\nNow, the client can operate as usual.\n\n```bash\nmkdir data\nvim data/file.txt\nkopia snapshot create data/\nkopia snapshot list\n```\n\n### Notes\n\n- The `--override-*` options are not essential for connecting to repository. If omitted, Kopia will use current user's name and hostname, and that will work well, assuming neither contains uppercase letters. In practice almost every Windows client will have uppercase letters in either hostname or username.\n- When specifying `--url`, you will need to specify the port explicitly, even if you've used the well-known HTTPS port `443`, e.g. `--url=https://kopia.example.org:443`.\n- You could skip `--server-cert-fingerprint` option entirely if the certificate you use is trusted by your system.\n\n## Bonus: Control setup\n\nKopia allows some control over server via API. To enable it, you will need to restart the server with additional options.\n\n```bash\nkopia server start --tls-cert-file cert_kopia.pem --tls-key-file cert_kopia_key --address \"https://127.0.0.1:12345\" --server-control-username control-user --server-control-password PWGN-control-password\n```\n\nSpawn a new shell; it does not need to have access to any of the config files we created so far. Optionally, give it a distinguishing name.\n\n```bash\nexport PS1='control$ '\n```\n\nNow set environment variables.\n\n```bash\nexport KOPIA_SERVER_ADDRESS=https://localhost:12345\nexport KOPIA_SERVER_USERNAME=control-user\nexport KOPIA_SERVER_PASSWORD=PWGN-control-password\nexport KOPIA_SERVER_CERT_FINGERPRINT=1497bfdb2ce6ec97b71f19b579bc0dc8651241d4e68b38993d7078f02fa28184\n```\n\nAfter this, you should be able to control server with commands in `kopia server` submenu.\n\n```bash\nkopia server status\nkopia server refresh\nkopia server shutdown\n```\n\n### Notes\n\n- API control commands are basically every command listed in `kopia server --help`, except `... start`, `... users` and `... acl`.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- You can use `printenv | grep KOPIA` to see if you have your environment variables correct.\n- If, when starting a Kopia server, it starts printing in logs warnings like `WARN got invalid CSRF token`, that means you have a browser tab open, that tries to speak to the previous instance of the server. Force reload this tab, or close it completely.\n\n## Additional information\n\n- There are four kinds of passwords that are needed for server setup.\n\t- One for upstream repository (`PWGN-upstream-password` in this example), mandatory.\n\t- One for WebUI, set via `KOPIA_SERVER_PASSWORD` variable, optional. You can disable WebUI using `--no-ui` option.\n\t- One for control API, passed via `--server-control-password`, optional. You can also disable control API using `--no-control-api`.\n\t- One per user per host, provided via `kopia server users add`. If you only run server for its WebUI, those are optional. You can also use `--no-grpc` to disable access for clients.\n- In practice, a lot of the options that are provided in environment variables throughout this tutorial can be provided via command-line options, or omitted entirely.\n\t- TLS fingerprints are not required if you use certificates that are trusted by your system.\n\t- Repository passwords, if not present in environment variables, can be provided interactively. They can also be cached in the credential manager, which is what you'll probably want to happen on the client side.\n\t- Config file location for clients can be the default. For server though, you should specify it explicitly, using an absolute path to a non-default location.\n\n## Exercises\n\nMake sure you got familiar with the environment you have created so far. Each exercise assumes you have Kopia server running and Kopia client ready to communicate with it.\n\n### Exercise 1: Client WebUI\n\nYou can start Kopia server for sole reason of having a UI available.\n\n1. Go to the client shell.\n2. Set the `KOPIA_SERVER_PASSWORD` environment variable for the client UI.\n3. Create a new TLS key pair. For example `user-webui.pem` and `user-webui_key`.\n4. Start a WebUI server. Make sure to pass the newly created TLS key pair, and use a different port for `--address` parameter (e.g. `12346`).\n5. Visit a server in a browser via `https://localhost:12346/` (you will also see this link in the logs).\n\nIf done right, you will be able to see your snapshots and create new ones via UI. This process is similar to what KopiaUI does for each connected repository when you view it.\n\nAnswer some questions:\n\n- Stop the WebUI and start it again with `--no-grpc` option added. Then try creating snapshots via browser. Can you explain why this works.\n- Compared to the \"Server side setup\", why did we skip the process of adding users this time?\n- Who is listed as the owner of snapshots in the WebUI?\n\nAfter this, stop the client's WebUI.\n\n### Exercise 2: Adding users\n\nYou can add and remove users to the running Kopia server without restarting it. This exercise assumes you have started server with `--server-control-` parameters.\n\n1. Go to the shell you used for control API.\n2. Set a `KOPIA_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable to the full path of the `upstream-repository.config` and `KOPIA_PASSWORD` to the upstream repository's password\n3. Add a new user using `kopia server users add`, for example `second@localhost`.\n4. Run `kopia server refresh`\n5. Go to the shell you used for client setup.\n6. Reconnect to the server using a new user's credentials. To do this, run `kopia repo disconnect`, update `KOPIA_PASSWORD` environment variable, connect using a new user's name in `--override-` parameters.\n7. Create snapshots as a new user.\n8. Return to the control shell. Run `kopia snap list --all`.\n\n### Exercise 3: Trusting certificates\n\nAs was mentioned above, you can connect to repository server without specifying the certificate fingerprint if the certificate is trusted by the OS. This exercise might need you to have a higher privileges to install the certificate.\n\n1. Install `cert_kopia.pem` as a trusted certificate authority in you system. On Windows you can use \"Current User's certificate store\", which shouldn't require administrative privilege. On Linux, read your distribution's manual on how to add certificates to the trust store.\n2. Go to the client shell, disconnect from the repository.\n3. Connect again, but do not specify the fingerprint option.\n4. Inspect the content of `user-side.config` file with a text editor.\n5. Confirm that client can access repository's content. For example, with `kopia snap list`.\n6. Remove certificate from the system's trusted store.\n7. Try accessing repository as a client again, and confirm that connection cannot be established anymore.\n8. Open `user-side.config` file in text editor and add current certificate's fingerprint as a value of `serverCertFingerprint` key.\n9. Confirm that client is able to communicate with server again.\n\nUsing fingerprints is only viable if you use long-living certificates. If you want to use short-lived certificates, consider setting up your private Certificate authority, or getting certificates signed by globally-trusted CAs, like Let's Encrypt or ZeroSSL.\n\n### Exercise 4: Understanding authentication process\n\n> This exercise is meant to help you understand which user/password pairs are used in different access scenarios. It replicates the setup described in [this comment](https://github.com/kopia/kopia/issues/880#issuecomment-798421751).\n\nKopia server authorizes incoming request for 3 purposes: for UI access, for GRPC, and for control API. Authorization decision is made entirely based on username. Here's what it means:\n\n- When Kopia server starts, it builds a list of known users.\n\t- If you use (legacy) `htaccess` file, it adds all users from it.\n\t- If you've set `KOPIA_SERVER_PASSWORD`, it adds one user, with the username specified in `KOPIA_SERVER_USERNAME` (or `kopia` by default).\n\t- If you've set `KOPIA_SERVER_CONTROL_PASSWORD`, it adds one user, with username specified in `KOPIA_SERVER_CONTROL_USER` (or `server-control` by default).\n\t- If you've added users via `kopia server users add`, it adds all users from there.\n- When access is requested, Kopia first authenticates user (checks if user/password pair is valid).\n- Then, based on whether it is UI, GRPC or API, Kopia checks the username\n\t- for UI access, it needs to match that specified in `KOPIA_SERVER_USERNAME`.\n\t- for API access, it needs to match that specified in `KOPIA_SERVER_CONTROL_USER`.\n\t- for GRPC access, username needs to match `username@hostname` pattern.\n\nIf you don't set `KOPIA_SERVER_PASSWORD`, but do set `KOPIA_SERVER_USERNAME` and it matches one of the known usernames, that user will be able access WebUI with their password.\n\n1. Go to the server's shell.\n2. Stop the currently running Kopia server.\n3. Start server with `--server-password=\"\"` option. This will override the `KOPIA_SERVER_PASSWORD` without the need to unset it. Also add `--server-username=\"first@localhost\"`, to reuse one of the already added users.\n4. Go to the browser page for the WebUI. Depending on your browser you might need to clear up cookies for this webpage. Log in using `first@localhost` and `PWGN-userpassword` as user/password.\n\nIf you have finished Exercise 2 and created snapshots as different users, you will be able to see all of them, not just the snapshots of the user you logged in as.\n" ],

I will check again after my 24 hour waiting time complete\n\nEdit: Yes above WSL data comes from Wakatime Integration.

In my initial post I gave two example methods that are commonly used, but I don???t know if either of those are use, or if another is used. \r\n\r\nWhat I???m actually trying to understand is the computational complexity of creating a single node. To know that I need to know how many splits are calculated at each node.", "@howarth got it. Working on it", "@howarth \r\n**Current Approach:**\r\nScikit-learn's decision tree implementation uses the \"best split\" strategy as the default approach to identify candidate splits. This means that for each feature, all unique values present in the training data are considered as potential splitting points. The criterion (e.g., Gini impurity or entropy) is computed for each unique value, and the value that maximizes the reduction in impurity is selected as the splitting point for that feature.\r\n\r\n**Alternative/Fix:**\r\nIf you are interested in an alternative approach for selecting candidate splits, you could consider using the \"random split\" strategy. In this approach, you randomly choose a subset of candidate values from the feature's range and evaluate the criterion for each of those values. This can significantly reduce the computational complexity, especially for features with a large number of unique values.\r\n\r\n**Code Location:**\r\nIf you want to delve into the code to understand how candidate splits are identified, you can look into the _splitter.pyx file in scikit-learn's source code. This file contains the core logic for finding the best split in decision trees. Specifically, you can explore the `BestSplitter` class, where the process of finding the best split point is implemented. You can find this here:\r\nhttps://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/main/sklearn/tree/_splitter.pyx", "@AyushChauhan-ui thank you! ", "@howarth , @AyushChauhan-ui , in the scikit-learn documentation , there is no detailed documentation for gini, variance reduction (which is used for regression trees) , entropy, information gain . Also there is one more splitting method we could add called chi-square splitting method. ", "Also the complexity that is mentioned is for binary trees and nothing specific about what is the computational complexity for particular decision tree algorithms like CART , ID3. That could be added too.", "> @howarth , @AyushChauhan-ui , in the scikit-learn documentation , there is no detailed documentation for gini, variance reduction (which is used for regression trees) , entropy, information gain . \r\n\r\nhttps://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html#mathematical-formulation\r\n", "> [...] for regression, an exhaustive method would be to sort each feature and then use the halfway point between each feature value. In this case there would be O(N*F) candidate splits where N=# data and F= # features. Another way would be to randomly choose K values between the min and max of each feature.\r\n\r\nIt's the former. See e.g. https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/a05eb6bbe30bc40904274c87afb4ac93bcd60168/sklearn/tree/_splitter.pyx#L472\r\n\r\nI don't think it's essential to spell this out in the User Guide, but I also don't think it would hurt. There have been some alternatives used, like left or right endpoints instead of midpoints, see e.g. https://datascience.stackexchange.com/q/32638/55122\r\n\r\nAlso, uniform selection in the feature range _is_ used, e.g. in IsolationForests.", "> Also the complexity that is mentioned is for binary trees and nothing specific about what is the computational complexity for particular decision tree algorithms like CART , ID3. That could be added too.\r\n\r\nScikit-learn implements CART. This is indeed a decision tree and the complexity for nodes, and tree is specified there: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html#complexity.\r\n\r\nWhile complexity is interesting, it will not give you the info about the splitter. Also the original question was something about random forest while here we are speaking decision tree.\r\n\r\nSo I see several documentation improvement:\r\n\r\n- [x] Improve the docstring of the `RandomForestClassifier` and `RandomForestRegressor` to make it obvious that the decision tree used under the hood are using `splitter=\"best\"`. I see that the `RandomForestRegressor` docstring is wrong because it refers to decision tree classifiers instead of regressors (it should be corrected as well).\r\n- [ ] Improve the user guide (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#random-forests) for the Random Forest to also mention that we use the best splitter for those.\r\n- [ ] Improve the user guide (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html#tree) of the decision tree such that we explain the best/random search. As far I can say, the requested information by @howarth could have been made explicit in the first paragraph of the \"Mathematical formulation\". This section is kind of written having the best splitter in mind, so we would need to either create a section or rework the narrative. I would see a section for finding the best split (the current narrative is nice) and add that split candidate are assessed exhaustively by a brute-force approach. Then, in the next section, I would explain the random approach simply by stating that we pick up a single split candidate randomly by feature.\r\n\r\nAn important point while modifying the documentation is to keep it as simple as possible and as succinct as possible as well.", "/take", "Hi all,\n\nThanks for the detailed discussion. I???ve reviewed the thread and code references. I???d be happy to help improve the documentation for RandomForestClassifier and RandomForestRegressor, especially around clarifying the use of the splitter=\"best\" strategy and how candidate splits are selected.\n\nI???ll start by drafting additions for:\n\nThe RandomForest* class docstrings to mention the best splitter.\n\nA short explanation in the [Random Forests user guide](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#random-forests) referencing that candidate splits are selected exhaustively per feature, using midpoint thresholds.\n\nPossibly extending the [Decision Trees guide](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html#tree) with a brief ???Finding the Best Split??? subsection for clarity.\n\nLet me know if that direction sounds good.

      "description" : "## What problem does this address?\n<!--\nPlease describe if this feature or enhancement is related to a current problem\nor pain point. For example, \"I'm always frustrated when ...\" or \"It is currently\ndifficult to ...\".\n-->\nMost of Block Editor components don't have stories.\nBlock Editor components's Storybook should also be added and updated like the Components.\nrelated #22891\n\n## What is your proposed solution?\n<!--\nPlease outline the feature or enhancement that you want and how it addresses any\nproblem identified above.\n-->\nWe can use this issue to track the addition and updating of the stories for Block Editor.\nYou can add the link to assign yourself to each component.\nAs I know, Block Editor Components list has never existed, so at first, we can start to be based on the directory name.\nThe list was made automatically, and we can ignore the component for native only.\n\nIf you cannot edit the list, please comment on which you made the PR for which directory's components.\n\ncc @WordPress/gutenberg-components \n\n## Best Practices\n\n### 1. Use CSF 3 format\n\nWrite stories as objects, not functions\n\n<details><summary>Do</summary>\n\n```jsx\nexport const Default = {\n\trender: function Template( { onChange, ...args } ) {\n\t\tconst [ value, setValue ] = useState();\n\t\treturn (\n\t\t\t<SomeComponent\n\t\t\t\t{ ...args }\n\t\t\t\tonChange={ ( ...changeArgs ) => {\n\t\t\t\t\tonChange( ...changeArgs );\n\t\t\t\t\tsetValue( ...changeArgs );\n\t\t\t\t} }\n\t\t\t\tvalue={ value }\n\t\t\t/>\n\t\t);\n\t},\n};\n```\n\n</details> \n\n<details><summary>Don't</summary>\n\n```jsx\nconst Template = ( { onChange, ...args } ) => {\n\tconst [ value, setValue ] = useState();\n\treturn (\n\t\t<SomeComponent\n\t\t\t{ ...args }\n\t\t\tonChange={ ( ...changeArgs ) => {\n\t\t\t\tonChange( ...changeArgs );\n\t\t\t\tsetValue( ...changeArgs );\n\t\t\t} }\n\t\t\tvalue={ value }\n\t\t/>\n\t);\n};\n\nexport const Default = Template.bind( {} );\n```\n\n</details> \n\n### 2. Consists of only one component\n \nThe purpose of Storybook is to test a single UI component itself. Therefore, unless there is a special reason, we should not include anything other than that component.\n\n### 3. Don???t create too many stories\n\nWhile it's tempting to expose as many variations of a component as possible, the behavior of the component can be changed in the Controls section.\n\nTherefore, additional stories should only be included if they involve significant visual or behavioral changes.\n\n### 4. About meta data\n\nTo display the source panel by default, specify `'shown'` in [the `meta.parameters.docs.canvas.sourceState` field](https://storybook.js.org/docs/api/doc-blocks/doc-block-canvas#sourcestate).\n\n<details><summary>Example</summary>\n\n```javascript\nconst meta = {\n\t// ...\n\tparameters: {\n\t\tdocs: {\n\t\t\tcanvas: { sourceState: 'shown' },\n\t\t\t// ...\n\t\t},\n\t},\n\t// ...\n};\n```\n\n</details> \n\nDefine the component description via the `meta.parameters.docs.description.component` field instead of a comment.\n\n<details><summary>Example</summary>\n\n```javascript\nconst meta = {\n\t// ...\n\tparameters: {\n\t\tdocs: {\n\t\t\t// ...\n\t\t\tdescription: {\n\t\t\t\tcomponent: 'Component description here...',\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t},\n\t},\n\t// ...\n};\n```\n\n</details> \n\nExplicitly define the type of props via the `meta.argTypes.{propName}.table.type.summary` field.\n\n<details><summary>Example</summary>\n\n```javascript\nconst meta = {\n\t// ...\n\targTypes: {\n\t\t// ...\n\t\tpropName: {\n\t\t\t// ...\n\t\t\ttable: {\n\t\t\t\ttype: {\n\t\t\t\t\tsummary: 'string',\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t},\n\t\t// ...\n\t},\n};\n```\n\n</details> \n\n\nFor private components, you may want to define the following fields to display the badge \uD83D\uDD12 ([Private APIs README](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/blob/trunk/packages/private-apis/README.md)).\n\nCheck [here](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/blob/f1fadbb036f1e702e3a28072444fd0de28a5dc02/packages/block-editor/src/private-apis.js#L57-L100) to see if the component is exported as private.\n\n<details><summary>Example</summary>\n\n```javascript\nconst meta = {\n\t// ...\n\ttags: [ 'status-private' ],\n\t// ...\n};\n```\n\n</details> \n\n### 5. Others\n\nIf the component you're working on doesn't have a README or JDoc, I'd appreciate it if you could do the following to clarify the component's implementation first:\n\n- If there's no README file: This is part of https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/22891. If the component already has JSDoc, you can use it to help write the README.\n- If there's no README and no JSDoc: You'll need to analyze the component's implementation and clarify the types of props and return types.

Working in the isolated story when iterating on the component (as opposed to working directly in the Gutenberg app) promotes better engineering standards because it forces you to think about encapsulation, clear interfaces, etc.\n- Increase iteration speed. Having a story is much faster for discovery and testing different states. You don't have to dig around the app to see where the component is used, figure out what states exist, and how to reproduce them.\n\nI honestly don't know if there is pure documentation value for the extenders.\n\nI'd like to emphasize that we should write the stories in a way that **keeps maintenance cost at a minimum**. It will quickly become a net-negative if the stories incur a maintenance cost. For example, avoid hardcoded values as much as possible, and try to structure things in a way that will not need fixing when the underlying component code changes. Don't write unnecessary descriptions, as those are another thing that need to be updated manually when things change. Let's start with the simplest possible.", "As a plugin developer, I find Storybook extremely useful.\n\nWhen implementing a UI for a custom block or block editor, I can see what components are exposed, what props are supported, and how they work.\n\nWithout Storybook, it's hard to imagine how something would work unless I actually wrote the code while reading the documentation, or found a place in the Gutenberg repository where the component is actually used.", "I have looked at the PR linked to this issue and I think we need some kind of indicator to unify our implementations and approaches for contributors who are already working on this issue or are planning to work on it.\n\nBelow are my thoughts on best practices, but @WordPress/gutenberg-components, if there are any mistakes, please let me know.\n\n### Use CSF 3 format\n\nWrite stories as objects, not functions\n\n#### Do\n\n```jsx\nexport const Default = {\n\trender: function Template( { onChange, ...args } ) {\n\t\tconst [ value, setValue ] = useState();\n\t\treturn (\n\t\t\t<SomeComponent\n\t\t\t\t{ ...args }\n\t\t\t\tonChange={ ( ...changeArgs ) => {\n\t\t\t\t\tonChange( ...changeArgs );\n\t\t\t\t\tsetValue( ...changeArgs );\n\t\t\t\t} }\n\t\t\t\tvalue={ value }\n\t\t\t/>\n\t\t);\n\t},\n};\n```\n\n#### Don't\n\n```jsx\nconst Template = ( { onChange, ...args } ) => {\n\tconst [ value, setValue ] = useState();\n\treturn (\n\t\t<SomeComponent\n\t\t\t{ ...args }\n\t\t\tonChange={ ( ...changeArgs ) => {\n\t\t\t\tonChange( ...changeArgs );\n\t\t\t\tsetValue( ...changeArgs );\n\t\t\t} }\n\t\t\tvalue={ value }\n\t\t/>\n\t);\n};\n\nexport const Default = Template.bind( {} );\n```\n\n### Consists of only one component\n\nI think the purpose of Storybook is to test a single UI component itself.

That function pulls all application extensions using `findExtensions(\"org.eclipse.core.runtime.applications\", true)`. Looking into `findExtensions()`, we noticed that it does not currently check whether the extension is available based on the product's dependencies.\n\nCan you please help us check our understanding? Does our understanding of how the `.product` file and application registration work seem correct? If not, are we missing a step in setting up the right dependencies? We would appreciate any feedback. Thank you very much!\n\n\n\n", "Hello, \n\nMy teammates @vihuynh72 and @JZavala210 have continued to work on the issue related to filtering the list of available applications in the Eclipse PDE runtime configuration. \n\nCurrently, we were looking at the `getApplicationNameSet()` method. As mentioned by my teammate @vihuynh72, `getApplicationNameSet()` controls the dropdown list of available applications in the .product editor UI. This method ultimately calls `PDECore.getDefault().getExtensionsRegistry().findExtensions(\"org.eclipse.core.runtime.applications\", true)`. \n\n<img width=\"1055\" height=\"792\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81254760-8ee1-4dd7-90da-455226085b1e\" />\n\nAs you can see from this screenshot, we've confirmed this displays many applications. \n\nWhat we've tried so far:\n\n- We've reviewed the implementation of `findExtensions` in `PDEExtensionRegistry.java` and noticed that when `activeOnly` is set to true, it filters using `PluginRegistry.getActiveModels()`.\n- We've also tried modifying the logic in the `else` block of `findExtensions` to change how extensions are gathered, but this had no impact on what was shown in the application dropdown list in the .product UI, which led us to wonder whether the filtering of applications needs to happen earlier or somewhere else. \n\n<img width=\"1041\" height=\"793\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6fa68b6-6488-41f2-b5d3-1775b7266086\" />\n\n\nOur current hypothesis is that the list of applications should be filtered down to only include those contributed by plugins that the current project explicitly needs, and therefore, we may need to update the UI logic to filter these based on what plugins are currently selected or included. \n\n\nCould you please confirm if our understanding is correct? Should the application dropdown ideally be filtered based on the current plugin???s dependencies? And if so, is there a separate step or location in the codebase where this filtering is intended to happen? Any insight/clarification would be very helpful! Thank you very much. " ],

Admin View Implementation Proposal\n\nI'd like to solve this issue by creating a comprehensive User Management system for the Admin View. Here's my detailed implementation plan:\n\nFrontend Implementation\n\n1. I'll create an `AdminUsers.tsx` component using Shadcn UI and Tailwind CSS, which will be linked to the `/admin/users` route.\n\n2. The component will include:\n   - A responsive data table showing user information (Name, Email, Role, JoinedAt)\n   - Search and filter functionality for easy user discovery\n   - Action buttons for each user (View, Promote to Admin, Ban User)\n   - Modal dialogs for user actions with confirmation steps\n   - Pagination for handling large user lists\n   - Export functionality for user data\n\n3. The component will use the existing AuthContext for data management and will implement proper error handling and loading states.\n---\nBackend Implementation\n\n1. I'll implement the following RESTful API endpoints:\n   - `GET /admin/users` - List all users with pagination and filtering\n   - `PATCH /admin/user/:id/promote` - Promote a user to admin role\n   - `PATCH /admin/user/:id/block` - Block/unblock a user\n\n2. I'll implement proper middleware:\n   - JWT authentication to verify admin tokens\n   - Role-based access control to ensure only admins can access these endpoints\n   - Error handling middleware for consistent error responses\n\n3. I'll update the MongoDB models as needed to support these operations.\n---\nSecurity Considerations\n\n1. All routes will be protected with JWT authentication\n2. Role-based middleware will ensure only admins can access these endpoints\n3. Input validation will be implemented on all endpoints\n4. Sensitive operations will require confirmation\n---\nTesting Strategy\n\n1. I'll test the complete flow on localhost before submitting\n2. I'll ensure all components render correctly and are responsive\n3. I'll verify all API endpoints work as expected\n4. I'll test error handling and edge cases\n\nI'm excited to contribute to this project and will follow all the development guidelines mentioned in the issue description.\n\n---\n\nLooking forward to your approval to start working on this feature!\n        ", "Hi @abhisek2004 , I'd love to work on this under GSSoC'25.\nPlease add the GSSoC'25 label, set a level, and assign it to me.\n@Avansh2006 ", "??? **Issue Assigned: \\[User Management Page ???

Start by exploring our [Contributing](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines, and don't forget to check out our [workspace setup guidelines](https://devdocs.jabref.org/getting-into-the-code/guidelines-for-setting-up-a-local-workspace) to get started smoothly.\n\nFor questions on JabRef functionality and the code base, you can consult the [JabRef Guru](https://gurubase.io/g/jabref) or ask on our Gitter chat.\n\nIn case you encounter failing tests during development, please check our [developer FAQs](https://devdocs.jabref.org/code-howtos/faq.html)!\n\nHaving any questions or issues? Feel free to ask here on GitHub. Need help setting up your local workspace? Join the conversation on [JabRef's Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/JabRef/jabref). And don't hesitate to open a (draft) pull request early on to show the direction it is heading towards. This way, you will receive valuable feedback.\n\nHappy coding! \uD83D\uDE80", "@koppor  @InAnYan  I don't think anything needs to be change.  i already see in the docs and saw that the only OpenAI sections refers to actual OpenAI specifics stuffs. More over  i saw there is an actual section stating how to run JabaRef with your local deployed LLM.

This is the reason for the rename. Ideally, we should split up \"OpenAI\" and \"OpenAI compatible API\" into seperate dropdowns, but since that would require more coding work, this issue here exists. The issue should definitely not be closed.\n\nHere is an example of me running a [qwen3-14B model](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3-14B-GGUF) (which is NOT from OpenAI) via [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) and as you can see the current development version of JabRef claims it is a model from OpenAI (which is not true):\n\n<img width=\"1089\" height=\"723\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3f61c4f-3823-4f18-9e67-500843ccfb0d\" />\n\n<img width=\"1668\" height=\"410\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f401789b-56ff-4f49-abf3-7796e95923b3\" />\n\n<img width=\"1664\" height=\"408\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c4223e4-61d5-446d-a3d6-d76424a22599\" />", "How about we just remove the provider name from processing and only mention the model name? Hmm. But we would be lying, if the (pre and post) processing was done by an ensemble of models, not just one. Then it would be a \"service\" by the AI provider. Not just a model.", "@SalvadorRomo I meant to rename the provider name in \"Provider\" combobox \uD83D\uDE06 \n\\+ check out `AiProvider`\n\\+ track where provider names are displayed, so that we won't have a problem that Thilo has shared on screenshot with loading dialog\n\nSorry, should've written a better issue description" ],

(`fn.something = ...` adds a new method to every p5 instance, but calling it on `fn` rather than on a p5 instance means it can't access anything that needs `this`.) I don't know that `downloadFile` actually needs `this` to work, but using `fn` out of an addon here is  likely the source of the bug.\n\nWe can probably import `downloadFile` from here and call it directly (`downloadFile(...)`) rather than trying to call it on `fn`: https://github.com/processing/p5.js/blob/3eae27613378af782910034211bc328cdaa8f125/src/io/utilities.js#L3", "Hi @ErnestSuyver sorry about creating the confusion and thanks Dave for jumping in!

", "That certainly works! depending on your use case, it may be faster to use `npm run dev` (which runs the sketch in `preview/`) or `npm run dev:global` (which runs the sketch in `preview/global/`) as both of those use hot reloading for faster iteration. Another approach, depending on the task, could be to write a unit test and run `npm run test` (which also reruns tests live when you make changes.)

      "description" : "### Increasing access\n\nIn 2.0, we released p5.strands! Currently, the documentation is a little sparse, and you have to find either our one tutorial, or look at the examples on a base shader (e.g. baseMaterialShader.) The text of the referencedoesn't mention strands. If we can document p5.strands more like how we document regular p5 functions, more people can discover it, and learning how to use it will be more straightforward.\n\n### Most appropriate sub-area of p5.js?\n\n- [ ] Accessibility\n- [ ] Color\n- [ ] Core/Environment/Rendering\n- [ ] Data\n- [ ] DOM\n- [ ] Events\n- [ ] Image\n- [ ] IO\n- [ ] Math\n- [ ] Typography\n- [ ] Utilities\n- [x] WebGL\n- [ ] Build process\n- [ ] Unit testing\n- [ ] Internationalization\n- [ ] Friendly errors\n- [ ] Other (specify if possible)\n\n### Feature enhancement details\n\nA p5.strands snippet might look something like this:\n```js\nmyShader = baseMaterialShader().modify(() => {\n  let time = uniformFloat(() => millis());\n  getWorldInputs((inputs) => {\n    inputs.position.y +=\n      20 * sin(time * 0.001 + inputs.position.x * 0.05);\n    return inputs;\n  });\n});\n```\nThe `getWorldInputs` function is a **hook**. These hooks are currently only described on the reference for the base shaders that use them (e.g. https://beta.p5js.org/reference/p5/basematerialshader/), and are currently described in GLSL, as that was the only way to modify shaders at the time those docs were written.\n\nI'm proposing that we:\n- Create a new reference page for each hook function (e.g. `getObjectInputs`, `combineColors`, etc)\n  - Since these methods are dynamically created, the reference pages can be made by placing a doc comment block at the end of a file describing each method even though the method itself is not next to the comment block (similar to [how properties of classes are documented.](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/blob/9515a629fd6979a20e0988ff6bb4b1c96eef6b2d/src/webgl/p5.Framebuffer.js#L1837-L1889))\n  - Put these in a new p5.strands section or subsection of the reference by using `@module` (for section) and `@submodule` (for subsection) in the doc comments. Open to ideas about exactly where in the reference it should go!\n  - Describe **without GLSL** how to use the hook\n  - Create (or copy from the base shader) an example or two for each hook reference (e.g. for hooks coming from multiple shaders, maybe show an example of each?)\n  - Link back to all the base shader references that include it (e.g. `getObjectInputs` is on I think all of our base shaders)\n- Update the base shader docs to link to all the individual hook docs rather than describing them all in a table\n- Update the `shader.modify()` docs to mention p5.strands JS callbacks as well as the object-with-glsl option currently described\n\nWe don't have to do all of these in one go, I can make a subtasks for each if someone is interested in getting started on just a part of this \uD83D\uDE42 ",

Before I update all hooks, I want to confirm the documentation style and file location.\nI am creating the new reference documentation for p5.strands hooks in:\np5.js/src/webgl/p5.strands.js\nHere???s what I???m planning for each hook (example: getWorldInputs) :\n\n```\n/**\n * @method getWorldInputs\n * @param {Object} inputs An object containing:\n *   - `position`: [x, y, z], the position of the vertex in world space\n *   - `normal`: [x, y, z], the normal vector in world space\n *   - `texCoord`: [u, v], the texture coordinates\n *   - `color`: [r, g, b, a], the vertex color\n * @return {Object} The modified inputs object\n * @example\n * <div modernizr='webgl'>\n * <code>\n * let myShader;\n * function setup() {\n *   createCanvas(200, 200, WEBGL);\n *   myShader = baseMaterialShader().modify({\n *     uniforms: {\n *       'float time': () => millis()\n *     },\n *     'getWorldInputs': (inputs) => {\n *       inputs.position[1] += 20 * Math.sin(time * 0.001 + inputs.position[0] * 0.05);\n *       return inputs;\n *     }\n *   });\n * }\n * function draw() {\n *   background(255);\n *   shader(myShader);\n *   lights();\n *   noStroke();\n *   fill('red');\n *   sphere(50);\n * }\n * </code>\n * </div>\n */\n\n```\n\nCould you please confirm if this is the correct style, level of detail, and file location for the new p5.strands documentation?\nIf so, I???ll proceed with the rest in this format. Thanks!", "For location: we currently have the rest of the p5.strands implementation in `src/webgl/ShaderGenerator.js`, potentially we could add these doc comment blocks to the end of that file? Or @lukeplowden if you think that file is getting too busy, then splitting these out into a separate file like you describe works too.\n\nThe doc comment structure looks good in general! Some small modifications:\n- If you add `@for p5` then that tells the reference that this is a global function and not a class function\n- `getWorldInputs` itself actually has no return value, and takes in a single function as a parameter. That function is what needs to take in an object containing those properties, and return a modified object. Maybe take a look at the callbacks in loading methods like [`loadImage`](https://beta.p5js.org/reference/p5/loadimage/) for an example of how to do the type for that.\n  - For the properties on an input, @lukeplowden and @perminder-17  what do you think would be the best way to describe those? `[x, y, z]` sorta looks like you'd access it like an array (e.g. `position[0]`) rather than like an object (`position.x`), but describing it like `{ x, y, z }` might be syntactically confusing too. It's kind of like a `p5.Vector`, but also it isn't one. What do you think about describing it like \"an object with `x`, `y`, and `z` properties\"?\n  - If we do the above, we may need to replace the `u` and `v` for the texture coordinate property with `x` and `y`, since those are the names you'd have to access its values with\n- As a last thing, as part of the description, can we also list and link to the reference for the shaders that have that hook?\n\nEDIT: one other thought. Currently we still have the `@experimental` label on other strands-related things, so we maybe should add that to these too for consistency.", "Also if it helps, feel free to make a [draft PR](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/introducing-draft-pull-requests/) with just some of the changes if you want to get feedback before then doing all the rest.", "\nThank you for the detailed feedback @davepagurek ! \n\nI???ll create a draft PR with just a few of the updated doc comments (for example, getWorldInputs, combineColors, and getPointSize) so you can review the style, level of detail, and file location before I update the rest.\n\nAlso, is it required to use the full PR template (with checklist, screenshots, etc.) for a draft PR, or is a simpler description acceptable at this stage? I want to make sure I???m following the project???s preferred workflow.\n\nThanks again for your guidance - looking forward to your feedback on the draft PR!", "Feel free to keep it simple for a draft \uD83D\uDE42 The rest can all be added later.", "Hi @davepagurek ,\n\nI???ve created a draft PR for early feedback on the p5.strands documentation changes : #7920.\n\nThe PR includes JSDoc doc comments and JavaScript examples for a few hooks (getWorldInputs, combineColors, getPointSize) as discussed.\n\nOnce I get feedback on the style, level of detail, and file location, I???ll update the rest of the hooks in the same way.\n\nThanks for your guidance!", "Hi @davepagurek !\n\nJust a friendly reminder - whenever you have a chance, could you please take a look at the draft PR #7920 opened for the p5.strands documentation?\n\nI???m looking for feedback on the style, level of detail, and file location before proceeding with the rest of the hooks.\n\nThank you!", "Hi!

Something to note is that the language server correctly picks up on most `p5` types. For instance when an image is loaded with `loadImage()` and stored into a variable, it implicitly has a type of `p5.Image`. However `createCapture()` is given an implicit type of `any`, so the `videoFeed` variable above is also of type `any`. Additionally when I hover over the import line: `import P5 from \"p5\";` I get the following message:\n```\nCould not find a declaration file for module 'p5'. '/Users/lukejans/Code/testing/p5-issue/node_modules/.pnpm/p5@2.0.3/node_modules/p5/dist/app.js' implicitly has an 'any' type.\nThere are types at '/Users/lukejans/Code/testing/p5-issue/node_modules/p5/types/p5.d.ts', but this result could not be resolved when respecting package.json \"exports\". The 'p5' library may need to update its package.json or typings. (ts 7016)\n```\nSo when I explicitly set the type in a JSDoc comment I get a language server hint that `P5.MediaElement` cannot be resolved.\n\n### Potentially Related Code\n\nhttps://github.com/processing/p5.js/blob/746a481a059152a7755423589a7860f4f1e0dcdc/src/dom/p5.MediaElement.js#L787-L790",

      "description" : "Currently if the `Counterscale.init()` function is run twice, it throws and error. \n\nSometimes code runs twice - like in react strict mode. So if it's already initialized, it would be nice to do one of these:\n\n1. It just returns early. Maybe silently? \n2. Provide the a function that will return the client, or a boolean from the GLOBALS variable here: https://github.com/benvinegar/counterscale/blob/main/packages/tracker/src/index.ts#L7 so ew can conditionally run init() \n\nAlso while we're talking about the client code - is it possible to also return early if `history` doesn't exist? Helpful for not breaking server rendered code.  Currently doing this:\n\n```js\nlet isInitialized = false;\nconst isClient = typeof window !== 'undefined';\n\nexport function analytics() {\n  if (isClient && !isInitialized) {\n    Counterscale.init({\n      siteId: `wesbos-${import.meta.env.DEV ? '-dev' : ''}`,\n      reporterUrl: 'https://nunyabiznass.wesbos.com/collect',\n    });\n    isInitialized = true;\n  }\n}\n```",

Execute `flutter run` on the code sample <!-- (see \"Code sample\" section below) -->\r\n2. Press button on page\r\n3. Observe that the text above the button doesn't change.\r\n4. Uncomment workaround in line 23 and try again.\r\n\r\n**Expected results:** Text respectively the Locale (`_locale` in WidgetsApp) changes.\r\n\r\n**Actual results:** `_locale` in WidgetsApp is still the same, nothing changes.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Code sample</summary>\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n      Please create a minimal reproducible sample that shows the problem\r\n      and attach it below between the lines with the backticks.\r\n\r\n      To create it you can use `flutter create bug` command and update the `main.dart` file.\r\n\r\n      Alternatively, you can use https://dartpad.dev/\r\n      which is capable of creating and running small Flutter apps.\r\n\r\n      Without this we will unlikely be able to progress on the issue, and because of that\r\n      we regretfully will have to close it.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n```dart\r\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\r\nimport 'package:flutter_localizations/flutter_localizations.dart';\r\n\r\nvoid main() {\r\n  runApp(const MyApp());\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass MyApp extends StatefulWidget {\r\n  const MyApp({super.key});\r\n\r\n  @override\r\n  State<MyApp> createState() => _MyAppState();\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {\r\n  List<Locale> supportedLocales = [const Locale(\"de\")];\r\n\r\n  @override\r\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\r\n    return MaterialApp(\r\n      title: 'Flutter Demo',\r\n      // Workaround: Overrides the _locale from WidgetsApp\r\n      // locale: supportedLocales[0],\r\n      supportedLocales: supportedLocales,\r\n      localizationsDelegates: GlobalMaterialLocalizations.delegates,\r\n      routes: {\r\n        '/': (context) => MyHomePage(onPress: () {\r\n              setState(() {\r\n                supportedLocales = [const Locale(\"en\")];\r\n              });\r\n            }),\r\n      },\r\n      initialRoute: \"/\",\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {\r\n  final VoidCallback onPress;\r\n\r\n  const MyHomePage({super.key, required this.onPress});\r\n\r\n  @override\r\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\r\n    return Scaffold(\r\n      appBar: AppBar(title: const Text(\"Flutter Demo Home Page\")),\r\n      body: Center(\r\n        child: Column(\r\n          children: [\r\n            Text(\"Current locale: ${Localizations.localeOf(context)}\"),\r\n            ElevatedButton(\r\n              onPressed: () => onPress.call(),\r\n              child: const Text(\"Press me to change locale\"),\r\n            ),\r\n          ],\r\n        ),\r\n      ),\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>flutter doctor -v</summary>\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n      Run your application with `flutter run --verbose` and attach all the\r\n      log output below between the lines with the backticks.

Leave a comment indicating that you are working on the issue, or just create a [pull request](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pulls) after following the steps below. [Mention](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) this issue in the description of the pull request.\n1. Fix the issue locally.\n1. [Run the test suite](https://llvm.org/docs/TestingGuide.html#unit-and-regression-tests) locally. Remember that the subdirectories under `test/` create fine-grained testing targets, so you can e.g. use `make check-clang-ast` to only run Clang's AST tests.\n1. Create a Git commit.\n1. Run [`git clang-format HEAD~1`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html#git-integration) to format your changes.\n1. Open a [pull request](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pulls) to the [upstream repository](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project) on GitHub.

This is a list of all the nodes that SDAG tries to handle and their current status is GISel. Some nodes have no equivalent in GISel. Missing nodes will presumably need to be ported over, under the assumption that they will eventually be useful somewhere. Some of the examples like https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/141933 and https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/142355 make a good example of what kind of thing needs to be added and how tests can be written.\n\n|SDAG computeKnownBits | Status |\n| --- | --- |\n| MERGE_VALUES| Not relavant |\n| SPLAT_VECTOR | [Done](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/139501) |\n|

To remove this dependency from `Storage/RequestForm`, **create a new `shared/views/StudioBanner` component that doesn't use Vuetify. Then use `StudioBanner` in `Storage/RequestForm` instead of `Banner`. Do not modifify `shared/views/Banner`.**\n\n**`StudioBanner` requirements**\n\n- Expected usage example:\n\n```vue\n// RequestForm.vue\n\n<StudioBanner\n  v-if=\"Boolean(errorCount())\"\n  error\n>\n  {{ errorText() }}\n</StudioBanner>\n```\n\n- Interface and implementation doesn't map exactly to that of `Banner`, and is limited only to logic that is needed for the request form\n- [KDS theme `palette.red.v_100`](https://design-system.learningequality.org/colors#palette-red-v_100) is used for red background color\n- Dynamic error display is preserved: If the banner is showing 9 errors, and then one of them is fixed, the banner immediatelly shows there is 8 errors, even before re-submitting the form.\n\n## How to get there\n\n- Login as `user@a.com` with password `a`\n- Go to _Settings > Storage_\n- In _'Request more space'_ section, click _'Open form'_ button\n- Submit the form without filling required fields\n\n## Guidance\n\n- Read [the project](https://github.com/learningequality/studio/issues/5060) this issue is part of\n\n## Out of Scope\n\n- Do not refactor any other areas of the codebase\n- Do not modify `Banner`\n- Do not migrate all `Banner` logic to `StudioBanner`. Focus on areas that are needed for this particular place and as specified above.\n\n## Expected UI/UX changes\n\n- Minor visual differences naturally stemming from the use of KDS\n  - Very slightly different shade of red \n\n## Acceptance criteria\n\n**General**\n\n- [ ] The specification above is followed.\n- [ ] Except for \"Expected UI/UX changes,\" there are no functional or visual differences in user experience.\n- [ ] All user interactions are manually tested with no regressions.\n- [ ] Pull request includes screenshots.\n\n**a11y and i18n**\n\nSee [the project](https://github.com/learningequality/studio/issues/5060)'s \"Guidance\" for useful references.\n\n- [ ] Implementation meets a11y standards\n- [ ] All components are LTR and RTL compliant\n- [ ] All user-facing strings are translated properly\n- [ ] The `notranslate` class been added to elements that shouldn't be translated by Google Chrome's automatic translation feature (e.g. user-generated text)\n- [ ] Mobile experience is reasonable\n\n**Unit tests**\n- [ ] If there is a unit test suite already, it is meaningfully updated (even if tests don't fail)\n- [ ] If there is no unit test suite, a new one is created. Do not use obsolete `@vue/test-utils` approach. Instead, use [Vue Testing Library](https://kolibri-dev.readthedocs.io/en/develop/frontend_architecture/unit_testing.html).",

Apologies if this has already been done and I didn't see, I'm not sure what it looks like from a non-owner participant POV!", "@lenathelibrarian, Can I ask a bit more about why you'd like to restrict categorization to staff members?  We've always worked under the assumption that the person who indexed a page has the context of the subject fresh in their minds, so is best situated to categorize it.  However, most projects that use this feature extensively are scholarly editions, which already have a restricted set of collaborators working on the project.  So I'd like to know more about your set-up to get more perspective on this feature.  \r\n\r\nWho do you expect to be transcribing, who will be indexing, and what are the purposes you plan to use the indexes for after they are exported from the platform?", "@benwbrum Sure, so our setup is actually that while we have librarians importing objects, moderating edits, and cleaning up subject links, there was an open call made for people to transcribe so we have many users with absolutely no background in metadata, and who we don't know personally and may never have visited our collections, editing these items. We do a lot of cleanup because of editors who don't follow the editing rules, besides the subject linking I've already spoken to you about. Our users probably wouldn't categorize the way we do. I don't really know what the indexes will be used for, but we anticipate DH projects of various kinds wanting to use them. (This was a big cross-library project announced when we moved to remote work and I'm working within one of the smaller collections.) So, it's important to us that we define the categories so that there's not so much cleanup and deletion that we have to do later. Does that make sense? I could also just not be understanding the scope of what you're asking. This is all very new to us. Thanks!", "Not that I was invited into this conversation, but the same is true for me when I'm working on documents with students in the context of the class. For them, the core activity is the transcription itself, and being able to engage with the documents, so I don't spend time training them on indexing. When I edit the work they've done, I go back and do the indices myself. It's actually worse when they try, because they generate a lot of accidental reduplications, typos, etc., and they are not always clear on what sorts of subjects are worth indexing, or how they should be categorized (or even whether a given proper noun is a person or a place).", "We've had a third conversation with an institution about differentiated controls over subject creation, and came up with this idea:\r\n\r\nCurrently subject indexing is enabled on a collection-by-collection basis.  If it's enabled, any user who can transcribe can also add wiki-links to the transcribe, creating (or updating) subjects linked to that page and categorizing any new subjects.  If it's disabled, users typing pairs of square braces merely type square braces: we interpret their transcriptions as plaintext and ignore the wiki links.\r\n\r\nIf we added a new \"Subject indexing by owners only\" setting, regular users would only be able to transcribe in plaintext.  Any square braces they added would not be interpreted as wikilinks.  If project owners edited the pages, they would be able to add wikilinks, and create or categorize subjects.", "So I worry that @benwbrum's last comment is about who can index subjects and this issue started out as who can create categories for subjects -- two related but different things.  I don't like forcing project owners to categorize all subjects (I can seem some liking collaborators doing that work), but I can definitely see the desire for control over the categories.  I think that that means is that we also need a \"let collaborators create subject categories\" checkbox.", "This is probably a question for @lenathelibrarian: if transcribers were unable to create subjects at all--rather than create them but not categorize them--would that address your needs?", "Hi @benwbrum! So, I agree with @saracarl's comment and I asked my colleague Dave and he agrees too. If we don't let transcribers create subjects at all, we add a truly daunting amount of work for ourselves. Even with the messiness that results, for our purposes it's still better for transcribers to be allowed to do some of the subject indexing work. I think we'd be happiest with keeping that part the way it is, but having a \"let collaborators create subject categories\" checkbox be optional if that rolls out. \r\nThe most helpful clean-up feature for us would be being able to multi-select subjects for deletion or movement between categories. If that's not a suggestion already I'm happy to open a new issue.", "Thanks @lenathelibrarian.  That helps.  I think we should open a new issue for \"The most helpful clean-up feature for us would be being able to multi-select subjects for deletion or movement between categories. \"  It falls into this as a broader category, but is more likely to get fixed if we have a separate (but linked) issue.\r\n\r\nWould you open that issue, please?" ],

I agree with Martin that there are issues with defining a good UX for that.\r\n\r\nSuch a feature could become unpopular for spamming `.gitignore` files with confusing entries, even if we do some basic optimizations. Then it might turn into a tempting target for scope creep to \"fix\" that. Also, it's not obvious to me that every `<pattern>` we might want to accept would map reasonably to `.gitignore` patterns. For examples of how that could get harder or more ambiguous in the future, see https://github.com/martinvonz/jj/issues/2915.\r\n\r\nI've occasionally imagined something like `jj [un]ignore <pattern>` that does this more directly, but it would have at least as many issues as doing it during `[un]track`.\r\n\r\nAnother detail we would want to consider is the UX for how we determine *which* `.gitignore` file we manipulate under which circumstances.

It's not ignored by that repository's local `.gitignore` so I don't think it's appropriate to add my own `!...` pattern to that file because of my global ignores. I did find a workaround of temporarily adding a negative pattern to `.gitignore`, running `jj st` so it starts tracking it, then deleting the pattern from `.gitignore`.", "To expand on the link from #4338, the newly current state of this is that there is a `jj track` command, but it does *not* currently allow tracking files ignored by `.gitignore`. \r\n\r\nIt should, and making it do so is probably what resolving this issue would now entail.\r\n\r\nSee also https://github.com/martinvonz/jj/pull/4338#discussion_r1740336563", "I would also consider it a blocker for closing this issue to teach `jj status` to print the untracked files.

The ones that are considered explicitly ignored, whether this comes from a gitignore, from a `jj untrack`, or from being outside a sparse pattern (there might be other possibilities I forgot).\r\n2. The ones that are not ignored but `jj` thinks the user might not actually want to snapshot. `jj` would want an explicit user confirmation before snapshotting such files. These would be files >1MB (the current behavior of `jj` with these files is clearly imperfect; what I'm talking about here might not be a sufficient solution to the problem but seems like it could be a part of it); perhaps there are other files that fit into this category like cache files (#4409) or files with secrets.\r\n\r\nMy first thought was that we only really need to show the second category in `jj status`.

Thank you!\n", "# Proposal for: Add functionality to settings `Open JSON file` entry to open the settings.json parent folder in Explorer\n\n## Overview\n\n**Repository**: microsoft/terminal  \n**Issue URL**: https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/12382\n\n## Problem Analysis\n\nThe current functionality allows users to open the `settings.json` file directly from the Windows Terminal settings menu. However, it lacks a feature to open the parent folder of the `settings.json` file in the Windows Explorer. This is beneficial for users who want to easily navigate through other configuration files or related resources located within the same directory.\n\nThe issue arises because the current implementation focuses solely on opening the `settings.json` file, without providing an option to access its containing folder. To address this, we need to modify the existing UI and functionality to include a new action for opening the parent folder in Explorer.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n1. **Add a New Menu Item**: Introduce a new menu item next to the `Open JSON file` entry that allows users to open the parent folder of the `settings.json` file in Windows Explorer.\n2. **Modify Existing UI Code**: Update the existing UI code to include this new menu item, ensuring it aligns with Microsoft's coding standards and design principles.\n3. **Implement Functionality**: Develop the backend logic to handle the action of opening the folder in Explorer when the new menu item is selected.\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n**Architecture Considerations**:\n- The solution will be integrated into the existing Windows Terminal application, specifically within the settings UI module.\n- The changes will ensure minimal impact on performance and security, adhering to Microsoft's standards for enterprise scenarios.\n\n**Code Changes**:\n- **Files to be Modified**: \n  - `src/cascadia/AppSettings/SettingsPage.xaml` (UI definition)\n  - `src/cascadia/AppSettings/SettingsPage.xaml.cs` (code-behind logic)\n- **Adherence to Microsoft Coding Standards**:\n  - Follow consistent naming conventions and coding practices.\n  - Ensure proper error handling and logging.\n  - Use appropriate design patterns, such as MVVM for UI components.\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n**Unit Tests**: \n- Write unit tests for the new menu item functionality using frameworks like MSTest or xUnit to ensure it behaves as expected under different conditions.\n\n**Integration Tests**: \n- Perform integration tests to verify that the new feature works seamlessly with other parts of the application, particularly the settings UI and file handling logic.\n\n**Regression Prevention**: \n- Include automated regression tests to prevent future issues related to this change. Ensure that existing functionalities remain unaffected by these modifications.\n\n## Timeline and Deliverables\n\n1. **Week 1**: Research and analyze the current implementation, design the solution, and create a detailed plan.\n2. **Week 2**: Implement the UI changes and add the new menu item.\n3. **Week 3**: Develop the backend functionality to open the folder in Explorer.\n4. **Week 4**: Write unit and integration tests, perform manual testing, and address any bugs or issues.\n5. **Week 5**: Submit a pull request with comprehensive documentation and test results.\n\n## Why This Approach\n\nThis approach aligns perfectly with Microsoft's development guidelines by:\n- Adding functionality that enhances user experience without disrupting existing features.\n- Adhering to the repository's coding standards, ensuring maintainability and scalability.\n- Leveraging Microsoft's established architecture patterns for seamless integration.\n\nBy following these steps, we can deliver a robust solution that meets the needs of the Windows Terminal user base while adhering to Microsoft's high-quality development practices.", "Hello, I'm a student contributor interested in working on this issue as my first open-source contribution.

      "comments" : [ "###  Wishlist \n\n1. **Notifications:** Notifications are one of the most important part of any monitoring stack.  It doesn't matter how well the actual monitoring works if you can't be properly notified.  So I would love to see the following in a proper notification module:\n - Central notification channel management.  I shouldn't need to go to every single monitor to change a notification channel.  I shouldn't have to make the same update multiple times (i.e. changing a discord webhook to a new discord webhook for example)\n- Pluggable notification channels.  By this I mean, the Bluewave team may have Slack, Discord, Telegram, and email included out of the box, some may want an obscure notification channel that they use (NTFY for example).  Make it simple to add a new notification channel module without having to modify core code.  This allows the system to be adaptable and expandable without having to have the Bluewave team be the choking point.  The team can chose to bring in any quality and useful channels the community builds in to the core product if they so desire to.\n- Ability to add multiple notification channels of the same type.  I should be able to have multiple discord channels, maybe one for prod, one for non-prod.\n- Ability to send to multiple notifications for the same monitor.  Example, disk runs low on serverA I want to notify the support discord channel so that maybe one of the engineers that has a minute can grab it.  At the same time, or maybe with a configurable delay, I want to notify the on-call pager via another means (PagerDuty, OpGenie, Grafana On-Call, etc) so they are paged and can act on it.\n- Notification escalations.  Notification has been sent, it hasn't been acknowledged and is still alerting XX time later (configurable, minutes, hours, etc) it escalates to a different notification channel.\n- Custom service monitoring.  Ability to monitor a service on a server is paramount to a monitoring solution.  Sometimes a service doesn't expose a port or endpoint or that endpoint is restricted.  So being able to monitor for a process on a server where capture is already running, would be useful. \n\n\n2. **Other**\n- Tags on monitors that allow me to search and filter based on them.  This would include in the notifications.  For example, I would like to be able to notify a customer when their service is having an issue.  So if I could setup the monitor that's monitoring their service with a tag, then on the monitor add a filter for tag = XXX, send to this channel, but also send to this other channel (for a production support team for example). Example of this concept is Grafana Alerting: https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/alerting/configure-notifications/\n- Searchable monitors.  Currently with ~150 monitors in Checkmate, I have to browse through all the pages to find the monitor I want to look at.  \n- Page size preference remembered sessions (at the user level would be ideal, along with having a global configurable default value).  Related to the above, if I change it to 25 per page and then refresh, it defaults back to 5.  Super annoying.\n- Custom script execution.  Similar to custom service monitoring, being able to create scripts or plugins that run and do something more complex than up/down and reports back a healthy or not makes a monitoring system extremely expandable and adaptable.  A good example is in Icinga/Nagios/Checkmk eco-system.  The parsing is simplified in that the return code of the plugin has to be 0, 1, 2, 3 for Ok, Warning, Critical, Unknown.  Then no need to have to parse all sort of different outputs.  https://www.monitoring-plugins.org/doc/guidelines.html#AEN74 \n- Websocket and gRPC monitoring.  Many of the endpoints I need to monitor are one of the two.  Being able to query them and check for successful replies is crucial to a complete monitoring solution.\n- Event handlers.  Being able to trigger event handlers based on certain criteria.  For example, if a service dies, restart it, however if that service dies more than once in a given time period, send a notification. \n- Ability to export metrics in prometheus style metrics.  Monitoring and observability are two different things, so even though I have monitoring in place I'm still going to have an observability platform.  Since the main metrics are being gathered by capture/checkmate, it would be nice if at a minimum those could be exposed as prometheus metrics, even better if there was a way to provide a prometheus compatible url and have it do the remote write.  \n\nAll these are features in other monitoring systems.  In all the cases where the ability to use a custom plugin, module, etc is proposed I would find it perfectly acceptable to require the plugin be written in a certain language and have other requirements (for example the return code of the custom script/plugin) to make it more easily to be \"plugged-in\" to checkmate/capture and to keep the system running efficiently.", "I think that we need the ability to group uptime and infrastructure monitors together, ie) all of the VMs in one section, all of the websites in a different section, external sites in a third section etc. ", "Ability to have agents in remote sites that push so no port forwarding needed in remote sites as the agents will send a heartbeat so as long as the server is reachable from the agent it will work (a plus if the agent can be used as a probe to reach other devices in that network)", "> I think that we need the ability to group uptime and infrastructure monitors together, ie) all of the VMs in one section, all of the websites in a different section, external sites in a third section etc.\n\nI think tagging monitors won't work in this case - you want them virtually grouped on the dashboard, right?

", "It would be fantastic to have the ability to show infrastructure information on the public status pages. (as an aside, the use of the word \"server\" in the app can be confusing - my assumption of \"server\" was that it was one of my servers (hardware) and not one of my services that I monitor for uptime and such, so adding \"servers\" to the status page was confusing to me as the servers (infrastructure in the app) I had added were not available to be added)\n\nI'd love to be able to show my users some basics about the hardware behind the scenes. Storage capacity/usage over time, CPU/RAM usage. Likely not nearly as much data as on a proper private dashboard, but I don't see why not allow the user to pick and choose which components they have being monitored infrastructure-wise and display them publicly. \n\nMy personal example would be two on-prem servers and one VPS and giving some high level data to those looking at the status page. Bonus points if the monitored services can be displayed in such a way that they tie back to the relevant server hardware being shown.", "> > I think that we need the ability to group uptime and infrastructure monitors together, ie) all of the VMs in one section, all of the websites in a different section, external sites in a third section etc.\n> \n> I think tagging monitors won't work in this case - you want them virtually grouped on the dashboard, right?

We also want to be able to manually wake / sleep devices.\n\nSo if we can have a simple CLI cron runner in Checkmate (i.e., the backend server runs the cron job on its host computer), we can have:\n- Wake on LAN tool\n- Ping tool\n- Literally any custom CLI call which the admin wants to set (maybe they want to `sudo systemctl suspend` at 5PM everyday, and then Wake on LAN at 9AM everyday)\n\nThese can be presented as buttons in the Three Dot Menu, along with a few modals here-and-there for inputs (e.g. Cron scheduler, custom command call, etc)\n\n**Our current solution:**\nWe run a custom container in docker which makes wake-on-lan calls for us.

Does this make sense?\n> Would be really awesome to see this implemented!\n\nCurious why not just run watchtower in monitor mode. Already does exactly what you're asking about. ", "@calebcall Yes you would be right, if Watchtower wasn???t abandoned, I can???t get simple notifications to work\nand as a bonus Checkmate would have an interface for said feature.", "Wishlist\nNotifications: Notifications are one of the most important part of any monitoring stack. It doesn't matter how well the actual monitoring works if you can't be properly notified. So I would love to see the following in a proper notification module:\nCentral notification channel management. I shouldn't need to go to every single monitor to change a notification channel. I shouldn't have to make the same update multiple times (i.e. changing a discord webhook to a new discord webhook for example)\nPluggable notification channels. By this I mean, the Bluewave team may have Slack, Discord, Telegram, and email included out of the box, some may want an obscure notification channel that they use (NTFY for example). Make it simple to add a new notification channel module without having to modify core code. This allows the system to be adaptable and expandable without having to have the Bluewave team be the choking point. The team can chose to bring in any quality and useful channels the community builds in to the core product if they so desire to.\nAbility to add multiple notification channels of the same type. I should be able to have multiple discord channels, maybe one for prod, one for non-prod.\nAbility to send to multiple notifications for the same monitor. Example, disk runs low on serverA I want to notify the support discord channel so that maybe one of the engineers that has a minute can grab it. At the same time, or maybe with a configurable delay, I want to notify the on-call pager via another means (PagerDuty, OpGenie, Grafana On-Call, etc) so they are paged and can act on it.\nNotification escalations. Notification has been sent, it hasn't been acknowledged and is still alerting XX time later (configurable, minutes, hours, etc) it escalates to a different notification channel.\nCustom service monitoring. Ability to monitor a service on a server is paramount to a monitoring solution. Sometimes a service doesn't expose a port or endpoint or that endpoint is restricted. So being able to monitor for a process on a server where capture is already running, would be useful.\nOther\nTags on monitors that allow me to search and filter based on them. This would include in the notifications. For example, I would like to be able to notify a customer when their service is having an issue. So if I could setup the monitor that's monitoring their service with a tag, then on the monitor add a filter for tag = XXX, send to this channel, but also send to this other channel (for a production support team for example). Example of this concept is Grafana Alerting: https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/alerting/configure-notifications/\nSearchable monitors. Currently with ~150 monitors in Checkmate, I have to browse through all the pages to find the monitor I want to look at.\nPage size preference remembered sessions (at the user level would be ideal, along with having a global configurable default value). Related to the above, if I change it to 25 per page and then refresh, it defaults back to 5. Super annoying.\nCustom script execution. Similar to custom service monitoring, being able to create scripts or plugins that run and do something more complex than up/down and reports back a healthy or not makes a monitoring system extremely expandable and adaptable. A good example is in Icinga/Nagios/Checkmk eco-system. The parsing is simplified in that the return code of the plugin has to be 0, 1, 2, 3 for Ok, Warning, Critical, Unknown. Then no need to have to parse all sort of different outputs. https://www.monitoring-plugins.org/doc/guidelines.html#AEN74\nWebsocket and gRPC monitoring. Many of the endpoints I need to monitor are one of the two. Being able to query them and check for successful replies is crucial to a complete monitoring solution.\nEvent handlers. Being able to trigger event handlers based on certain criteria. For example, if a service dies, restart it, however if that service dies more than once in a given time period, send a notification.\nAbility to export metrics in prometheus style metrics. Monitoring and observability are two different things, so even though I have monitoring in place I'm still going to have an observability platform. Since the main metrics are being gathered by capture/checkmate, it would be nice if at a minimum those could be exposed as prometheus metrics, even better if there was a way to provide a prometheus compatible url and have it do the remote write.\nAll these are features in other monitoring systems. In all the cases where the ability to use a custom plugin, module, etc is proposed I would find it perfectly acceptable to require the plugin be written in a certain language and have other requirements (for example the return code of the custom script/plugin) to make it more easily to be \"plugged-in\" to checkmate/capture and to keep the system running efficiently", "How about supporting dedicated, persistent API tokens whith more or less granular permissions? Current workflow would be to login via the API, retrieve the token and use that for further API requests. This is rather bad for scripting/interfacing the API with an automation.\n\nThere's the checkmate CLI but this also seems to require username + password the aquire a token in the first place.\n\nMy usecase for this is basically having a script/daemon that's reads information from a Netbox and adds/updates/deletes monitors in Checkmate accordingly.", "> How about supporting dedicated, persistent API tokens whith more or less granular permissions?

Would be great if this lands in Checkmate, but no hurry :)", "It would be great if we could monitor docker containers by name and not just ID - given that the ID changes when containers are taken down for any reason.\n\nThis is achievable with Uptime Kuma", "It would be great if we could make our app even more accessible for everyone!\nWe???ve already got some accessibility basics covered and we partially meet the WCAG Level A and some Level AA guidelines. but we know there???s still room to grow.

Some of this is already in place, but we want to make it even better!", "From deploying it on Kubernetes (and more kubernetes-related enhancements), here's my wishlist:\n\n- Support creating a \"registration token\" that could be used to let Capture auto-register to it.\n- Upgrade the current helm chart to something more full-fledged using sub-charts: I've used a combination of bjw-s-labs/app-template, bitnami/redis, bitnami/mongodb to have a more versatile deployment.\n- Upgrade the current helm chart to define a Capture daemonset to monitor the Kubernetes nodes\n- Allow passing variables to assemble the mongodb connection string (DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_USER, DB_PASS, etc.) instead of forcing `DB_CONNECTION_STRING`\n- Support for scanning and discovering ingresses inside the Kubernetes cluster to monitor them automatically.\n\nNot really Kubernetes-related but also interesting:\n- Add compatibility with other agents, such as node-exporter or telegraf.\n- Allow setting dependencies or links between services and infrastructure machines", "Thank you @InputObject2 - can you briefly describe this one and possibly give a use-case? \n\n> * Allow setting dependencies or links between services and infrastructure machines\n\n", "> Thank you [@InputObject2](https://github.com/InputObject2) - can you briefly describe this one and possibly give a use-case?\n> \n> > * Allow setting dependencies or links between services and infrastructure machines\n\nI'd like to see if a service is down -> here are the related components to help give context in failure investigation or to stop spam alerts.\n\nUse-case 1: if I have a healthcheck for `www.mydomain.local` and I know the `www` service runs on server `docker-host-1` and needs a database on `??db-host-1`, I'd like to see at a glance how the components that make up that service are doing.\n\nUse-case 2: If `service-A` has a dependency on `service-B`, I'd like to suppress alerts for `service-A` if `service-B` is down.

UI Improvements:\nRefactor layout using st.columns() and st.container() for better structure.\n\nAdd section headers, icons, and dividers for clarity and visual polish.\n\nUse st.sidebar for controls to declutter the main screen.\n\nAdd progress/status indicators (e.g., spinner, success message) during processing.\n\n2. Dynamic Image Upload Support:\nEnable real-time image uploads using st.file_uploader.\n\nSupport multiple file types (jpg, png, jpeg) and handle edge cases (e.g., large or corrupted files).\n\nDisplay uploaded images instantly using st.image() for preview.\n\nAdd validations for image size, type, and dimension before processing.\n\n3. Optional Enhancements:\nAdd dark/light mode toggle using Streamlit theming.\n\nDisplay processed results side-by-side with the uploaded image.\n\nLet me know if there are any design guidelines or features you'd like me to prioritize.

Am I simply passing stuff wrong?\n\n@DarkLight1337 I'm running the `vllm/vllm-openai:latest` docker image passing args: `--port 8000 --model /path/to/weights --tokenizer /path/to/weights --enable-prefix-caching --max-model-len 1000000 --limit-mm-per-prompt image=5 --load-format auto -dtype auto --kv-cache-dtype fp8 --tensor-parallel-size 8 --tool-call-parser llama3_json`\n\nMy output, when I go `input` --> `/tokenize` --> `/detokenize` --> `output`, looks like:\n```\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"<|begin_of_text|><|header_start|>user<|header_end|>\\n\\n[\\n{\\\"type\\\":\\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"Whats in this image?\\\"}, \\n{\\n\\\"type\\\": \\\"image_url\\\",\\n\\\"image_url\\\": {\\n\\\"url\\\": \\\"data:image/jped;base64,iSFHjlIEHVjALKSIk02k4j8KSF8jlkafLSKDJF...\"\n}\n```\nBasically, it's just escaping my messages array and then encoding the b64 as a string literal.\n\nWhat I would expect to see is something like:\n```\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"<|begin_of_text|><|header_start|>user<|header_end|><|image_start|><|image|><|patch|>...<|patch|><image_end|>Whats in this image?<|eot|><|header_start|>assistant<|header_end|>\"\n}\n```\n          ", "HF tokenizers don't process images. What you want is HF processor which is created via `AutoProcessor` class", "That being said, I think it makes sense to extend the endpoint to support images and other multimodal data. Any contributions are welcome!" ],

      "description" : "## What would you like clarification on:\r\n\r\nHow to migrate an existing UWP project without destroying the existing folder structure.\r\n\r\n## Concern?\r\n\r\nIt seems the current documentation for migrating an existing UWP project to Uno Platform recommends destroying the existing folder structure by moving all files into the new Shared project folder. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/unoplatform/uno/blob/master/doc/articles/migrating-apps.md\r\n\r\nThis is undesirable for a number of reasons:\r\n\r\n 1. The existing UWP solution/project should still work and Uno should work along side it\r\n 2. The repository version history should not be significantly changed by moving all files over. It just creates complications tracking change history.\r\n 3. The existing folder structure of a project may already be used by existing scripts and other tooling\r\n\r\nIt seems to work just fine to modify the default Uno Solution files and then the shared project to instead point to a folder of existing code. For example, the following directory structure seems to work. The new Uno Folder could also be added at the same level of the existing Source folder.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\uD83D\uDDC0 Source                 : Existing UWP project and all of its files\r\n    ??? \uD83D\uDDC0 Uno              : New Uno directory for Uno project and build files\r\n    ???  ??? \uD83D\uDDC0 App.Droid\r\n    ???  ??? \uD83D\uDDC0 App.iOS\r\n    ???  ??? \uD83D\uDDC0 App.macOS\r\n    ???  ??? \uD83D\uDDC0 App.UWP       : Can be removed\r\n    ???  ??? \uD83D\uDDC0 App.Wasm\r\n    ???

      "comments" : [ "# :wave: Important: PLEASE READ :wave:\n\nThis issue has been labeled as a **good first issue** and is available for anyone to work on.\n\nIf this is your first time contributing to an open source project, some aspects of the development process may seem unusual, arcane, or some combination of both.\n\n1.  **You cannot \"claim\" issues.** People new to open source often want to \"claim\" or be assigned an issue before beginning work. The typical rationale is that people want to avoid wasted work in the event that someone else ends up working the issue. However, this practice is not effective in open source, as it often leads to \"issue squatting\", in which an individual asks to be assigned, is granted their request, and then never ends up working on the issue. Accordingly, you are encouraged to communicate your intent to address this issue, ideally by providing a rough outline as to how you plan to address the issue or asking clarifying questions, but, at the end of the day, we will take running code and rough consensus in order to move forward quickly.\n2.  **We have a very high bar for contributions.** We have very high standards for contributions and expect all contributions???whether new features, tests, or documentation???to be rigorous, thorough, and complete. Once a pull request is merged into stdlib, that contribution immediately becomes the collective responsibility of all maintainers of stdlib. When we merge code into stdlib, we are saying that we, the maintainers, commit to reviewing subsequent changes and making bugfixes to the code. Hence, in order to ensure future maintainability, this naturally leads to a higher standard of contribution.\n\nBefore working on this issue and opening a pull request, please read the project's [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md). These guidelines and the associated [development guide](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/docs/contributing/development.md) provide important information, including links to stdlib's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), license policy, and steps for setting up your local development environment.\n\nTo reiterate, we **strongly** encourage you to refer to our contributing guides **before** beginning work on this issue. Failure to follow our guidelines significantly decreases the likelihood that you'll successfully contribute to stdlib and may result in automatic closure of a pull request without review.\n\nSetting up your local development environment is a critical first step, as doing so ensures that automated development processes for linting, license verification, and unit testing can run prior to authoring commits and pushing changes. If you would prefer to avoid manual setup, we provide pre-configured [development containers](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/tree/develop/.devcontainer) for use locally or in GitHub Codespaces.\n\nWe place a high value on consistency throughout the stdlib codebase. We encourage you to closely examine other packages in stdlib and attempt to emulate the practices and conventions found therein.\n\n-   If you are attempting to contribute a new package, sometimes the best approach is to simply copy the contents of an existing package and then modify the minimum amount necessary to implement the feature (e.g., changing descriptions, parameter names, and implementation).\n-   If you are contributing tests, find a package implementing a similar feature and emulate the tests of that package.\n-   If you are updating documentation, examine several similar packages and emulate the content, style, and prose of those packages.\n\nIn short, the more effort you put in to ensure that your contribution looks and feels like stdlib???including variables names, bracket spacing, line breaks, etc???the more likely that your contribution will be reviewed and ultimately accepted. We encourage you to closely study the codebase **before** beginning work on this issue.\n\n:sparkles: Thank you again for your interest in stdlib, and we look forward to reviewing your future contributions. :sparkles:\n" ],

      "description" : "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\nWe are using SaltStack to manage OpenBao configuration, and we'd like to validate the OpenBao config file before starting or reloading the service. The closest existing feature is `bao operator diagnose`, which does parse the configuration file. However, it also attempts to initialize the storage backend, which can be unsafe or misleading when run via automation, especially if the service is not yet running or the backend is locked. This makes it less suitable for use in pre-start validation.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nA dedicated subcommand that performs only configuration parsing and validation, such as:\n\n```\nbao operator validate-config -config /etc/openbao/openbao.hcl\n```\n\nThis command should:\n- Return non-zero exit codes on parse errors.\n- Perform only config file parsing/validation.\n- Avoid initializing storage backends, telemetry systems, or listeners.\n- Be safe to run on stopped or uninitialized systems, as well as running instances.\n- Allow the config file to be specified as the last argument in the command line, so that it works with a temp file passed by SaltStack's check_cmd requisite.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\n- Using `bao operator diagnose -skip=storage`: this still attempts to initialize storage.\n- Wrapping `bao server -dev`: this seems brittle, and may behave differently in the future.\n- Wrapping `bao operator diagnose` and skipping validation entirely when the service isn't running: this works but sacrifices safety and/or functionality in first-time or immutable deployments.\n\n**Explain any additional use-cases**\n\n- CI/CD pipelines validating configuration changes before deployment\n- Pre-flight checks during provisioning of new clusters or cluster nodes\n- GitOps workflows that want to dry-run HCL validation before applying config\n- Admins validating config changes without disrupting live OpenBao instances\n\n**Additional context**\nOutput of `bao operator diagnose` on a running instance of OpenBao 2.3.1 with a valid config file:\n```\npmcconnell@openbao001:~$ sudo -u openbao bao operator diagnose -config /etc/openbao/openbao.hcl\nOpenBao v2.3.1 (e3cdbbde8eb48fb7ae92b1d34afb63012e805233), built 2025-06-25T19:20:49Z\n\nResults:\n[ failure ] Vault Diagnose\n  [ success ] Check Operating System\n    [ success ] Check Open File Limits: Open file limits are set to 1048575.\n    [ success ] Check Disk Usage: / usage ok.\n  [ success ] Parse Configuration\n  [ failure ] Check Telemetry: incomplete Stackdriver telemetry configuration, missing stackdriver_project_id\n  [ failure ] Check Storage: Diagnose could not initialize storage backend.\n    [ failure ] Create Storage Backend: Error initializing storage of type raft: failed to create fsm: failed\n      to open bolt file: timeout\n\npmcconnell@openbao001:~$ echo $?\n4\n```",

The background color is (almost?) the same:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f04e3ad-ba05-41a6-ac97-2da1946f3aa7)\n\nIt would be good to be more visually obvious when a row is selected vs. hovered.\n\nExample code:\n\n```python\nimport taipy.gui.builder as tgb\nfrom taipy import Gui\n\ndata = {\"a\": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], \"b\": [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]}\n\nselected = [0]\n\n\ndef num_on_action(state, var_name, payload):\n    index = payload.get(\"index\")\n    if index in state.selected:\n        state.selected = list(set(state.selected) - {index})\n    else:\n        state.selected = state.selected + [index]\n\n\nwith tgb.Page() as page:\n    tgb.toggle(theme=True)\n\n    tgb.table(\"{data}\", selected=\"{selected}\", on_action=num_on_action)\n\n    tgb.table(\"{data}\", selected=\"{selected}\", on_action=num_on_action, class_name=\"rows-similar rows-bordered\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    gui = Gui(page=page)\n    gui.run(run_browser=False, use_reloader=True)\n```\n\nPlay around with:\n1. Changing the theme\n2. Selected different rows\n3. Hovering over different rows\n\nI quickly get very confused with the colors. It's much better on the table with \"rows-similar\" though.\n\n### \uD83D\uDCA1 Proposed Solution\n\nOverhaul the stylekit for taipy tables. Consider interaction with:\n1. Theme\n2. \"rows-similar\" stylekit class\n3. \"selected\" rows (Mui-selected)\n4. Hovering on selected/unselected rows\n\nConsider adding:\n1. Different background color for table header row\n\n### \uD83D\uDCDC Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I have checked the [existing issues](https://github.com/Avaiga/taipy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+) to avoid duplicates.\n- [ ] I am willing to work on this issue (optional)\n\n### ??? Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] A working demo or example code (if applicable) is provided.\n- [ ] Integration tests demonstrate the new functionality.\n- [ ] Any new code is covered by unit tests.\n- [ ] Code coverage remains at least 90%.\n- [ ] Related documentation updates and release notes are created.",

Forked and cloned the repository, then searched the codebase for `readline` usage to find the core input handling logic.\n2.  Identified `useKeypress.ts` (for raw keypress events) and `InputPrompt.tsx` (for input logic) as the key files.\n3.  To see what the application receives, I temporarily modified the code to log every keypress event to a `debug.log` file.\n4.  **Key Finding:** My initial debugging proved that on a default macOS Terminal, `Shift+Enter` sends the exact same sequence (`\\r`) as a regular `Enter` press, making the two indistinguishable.\n\n### Attempted Fix & The Final Discovery\n\nBased on the initial finding, I attempted a code-only fix by teaching the application to listen for a different key combination, `Shift+Down`, which often sends a unique sequence on other terminals.\n\n1. The Code I Tested\nI modified `useKeypress.ts` to listen for the `Shift+Down` sequence (`\\x1b[1;2B`) and `InputPrompt.tsx` to handle a `key.shift` flag.\n\n```typescript\n// In useKeypress.ts, I added a check:\nif (key.sequence === '\\x1b[1;2B') {\n  key.name = 'return';\n  key.shift = true;\n}\n```\n```typescript\n// In InputPrompt.tsx, I added the key.shift check:\nif (key.ctrl || key.meta || key.shift || charBefore === '\\\\' || key.paste) {\n  // ... newline logic\n}\n```\n\n2. The Result: It Also Failed\nThis proof-of-concept did not work. To understand why, I used the `cat` command to see what my terminal was actually sending when I pressed `Shift+Down`.\nFinal Proof: The terminal sent `^[[B`, which is the standard escape code for a plain Cursor Down key.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis investigation leads to a definitive conclusion: the default macOS Terminal is more limited than anticipated. It appears to strip the `Shift` modifier information from both the `Enter` key and the arrow keys, making a code-only fix for a `Shift+Key` newline combination unfeasible on this specific platform, although i think this might work on other platforms which by default register shift + down as '\\x1b[1;2B' but i cant really test it.\n\nThis might explain why `Ctrl+J` is a common suggested alternative, as it sends a universal newline character (`\\n`) that doesn't rely on modifier key parsing.\n\nAs this is my first contribution, my analysis could be wrong, and I apologize for the detailed-but-failed attempt. Given these findings, what is the desired path forward? Any information from the internal `b.corp.google.com` link about how other terminals are supported would still be very helpful.\n\nThank you for your time and guidance.", "Just to add, I personally use the Warp Terminal on Mac.

Since then i don't care about how it is called, i just increase it whenever i want, especially when i have a lot of solar overproduction just to store more energy in the house. \n\nhttps://github.com/BenPru/luxtronik/issues/263", "@apf-doit and how do you do it? Via luxtronik write command or custom automation? I have no entities, that set this mode directly.", "@Gifford47 i have an entity named \"number.luxtronik2_dhw_target_temperature\" which basically is what it says it is: domestic water temperature. Combined with an automation checking the solar production and few other checks like current energy price, i increase the temp from default 45 to 60 and turn back when the temp is reached. The default desinfection target temp is actually 65, but with that entity i cannot set above 60, don't know why. But 60 is hot enough.

Usually by more than 50%.\n\nMay I ask how you disable or enable the hot water circulation pump? I think the \"ID_Einst_BWZIP_akt\" is not in the current implementation from BenPru. But I can add it via Bouni and YAML. right? ", "@Mehli12 \nYeah, looks like I managed it with the integration by Bouni.\nI monitor it's state with a sensor added in the configuration file:\n```\nsensor:\n  - platform: luxtronik\n    sensors:\n      - group: parameters\n        id: ID_Einst_BWZIP_akt\n        friendly_name: Circulation Pump\n```\n\nAn change it's value with the `luxtronik.write` action:\n```\naction: luxtronik.write\ndata:\n  parameter: ID_Einst_BWZIP_akt\n  value: 1\n```\n\nHowever, the post I made actually inspired me to find a more reliable way to disable the circulation pump. I realized it could work more seamlessly with the heat pump if I used the integration to modify the circulation **schedule** instead of just turning it off directly.\n\nWith a bit of help from Gemini, I figured out the parameters used for the matrix that stores circulation start and end times (in seconds from midnight). The IDs follow this pattern:\n\n**ID_Einst_SuZIP + Wo/25/Tg + _zeit_X_Y**\n\n- The first part indicates it???s a schedule for the circulation pump.  \n- The second part defines the type of schedule:  \n  - `Wo` ??? same for every day  \n  - `25` ??? different for weekends  \n  - `Tg` ??? different for each day (just like in the heat pump settings)  \n- The last part defines the coordinates in the matrix:  \n  - `X` is the row (values 0???4)  \n  - `Y` is the column:  \n    - `0` = start time, `1` = end time for day 1  \n    - `2` = start time, `3` = end time for day 2, and so on  \n\nFor example, `ID_Einst_SuZIP25_zeit_0_2` refers to the **start time for the weekend schedule on day 2**.\n\nSo, instead of completely disabling the circulation pump, I now modify the schedule based on presence. When everyone leaves, the schedule changes from the normal 6:00???00:00 to just **on at 6:00 and off at 6:15**. I use the same `luxtronik.write` action as before. This method has proven to be much more reliable for keeping the pump off when it???s not needed.\n\nAdditionally, if no one is home at 5:58, I change the schedule to end at **5:55**, and start at **5:50**, wait 18 minutes, then switch it back to the usual 6:00???6:15. I update the **end time first**. The system handles this well???even if the end time is earlier than the start time. For instance, if the start time is 6:00 and the end time is 5:00, the pump runs from 6:00 **until 5:00 the next day** and **doesn't run** from 5:00 to 6:00.\n\nSo I've been using that **instead of** `ID_Einst_BWZIP_akt` for the past few days and I think it's going to stay that way.\n", "@BenPru is it possible to impliment this Switch into your Addon", "When adding the entity, please provide a bit of documentation on how the parameter should be used. Some of these parameters are not very intuitive, can cause unexpected behavior or reduce the efficiency when not properly used. We really need to capture the information in this topic so it can be found again.", "@felixs2103 I have added the switch to branch #310. Please test it in this.\nTodo: Add other translations." ],
