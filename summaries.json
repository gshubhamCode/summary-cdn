      "comments" : [ "###  Wishlist \n\n1. **Notifications:** Notifications are one of the most important part of any monitoring stack.  It doesn't matter how well the actual monitoring works if you can't be properly notified.  So I would love to see the following in a proper notification module:\n - Central notification channel management.  I shouldn't need to go to every single monitor to change a notification channel.  I shouldn't have to make the same update multiple times (i.e. changing a discord webhook to a new discord webhook for example)\n- Pluggable notification channels.  By this I mean, the Bluewave team may have Slack, Discord, Telegram, and email included out of the box, some may want an obscure notification channel that they use (NTFY for example).  Make it simple to add a new notification channel module without having to modify core code.  This allows the system to be adaptable and expandable without having to have the Bluewave team be the choking point.  The team can chose to bring in any quality and useful channels the community builds in to the core product if they so desire to.\n- Ability to add multiple notification channels of the same type.  I should be able to have multiple discord channels, maybe one for prod, one for non-prod.\n- Ability to send to multiple notifications for the same monitor.  Example, disk runs low on serverA I want to notify the support discord channel so that maybe one of the engineers that has a minute can grab it.  At the same time, or maybe with a configurable delay, I want to notify the on-call pager via another means (PagerDuty, OpGenie, Grafana On-Call, etc) so they are paged and can act on it.\n- Notification escalations.  Notification has been sent, it hasn't been acknowledged and is still alerting XX time later (configurable, minutes, hours, etc) it escalates to a different notification channel.\n- Custom service monitoring.  Ability to monitor a service on a server is paramount to a monitoring solution.  Sometimes a service doesn't expose a port or endpoint or that endpoint is restricted.  So being able to monitor for a process on a server where capture is already running, would be useful. \n\n\n2. **Other**\n- Tags on monitors that allow me to search and filter based on them.  This would include in the notifications.  For example, I would like to be able to notify a customer when their service is having an issue.  So if I could setup the monitor that's monitoring their service with a tag, then on the monitor add a filter for tag = XXX, send to this channel, but also send to this other channel (for a production support team for example). Example of this concept is Grafana Alerting: https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/alerting/configure-notifications/\n- Searchable monitors.  Currently with ~150 monitors in Checkmate, I have to browse through all the pages to find the monitor I want to look at.  \n- Page size preference remembered sessions (at the user level would be ideal, along with having a global configurable default value).  Related to the above, if I change it to 25 per page and then refresh, it defaults back to 5.  Super annoying.\n- Custom script execution.  Similar to custom service monitoring, being able to create scripts or plugins that run and do something more complex than up/down and reports back a healthy or not makes a monitoring system extremely expandable and adaptable.  A good example is in Icinga/Nagios/Checkmk eco-system.  The parsing is simplified in that the return code of the plugin has to be 0, 1, 2, 3 for Ok, Warning, Critical, Unknown.  Then no need to have to parse all sort of different outputs.  https://www.monitoring-plugins.org/doc/guidelines.html#AEN74 \n- Websocket and gRPC monitoring.  Many of the endpoints I need to monitor are one of the two.  Being able to query them and check for successful replies is crucial to a complete monitoring solution.\n- Event handlers.  Being able to trigger event handlers based on certain criteria.  For example, if a service dies, restart it, however if that service dies more than once in a given time period, send a notification. \n- Ability to export metrics in prometheus style metrics.  Monitoring and observability are two different things, so even though I have monitoring in place I'm still going to have an observability platform.  Since the main metrics are being gathered by capture/checkmate, it would be nice if at a minimum those could be exposed as prometheus metrics, even better if there was a way to provide a prometheus compatible url and have it do the remote write.  \n\nAll these are features in other monitoring systems.  In all the cases where the ability to use a custom plugin, module, etc is proposed I would find it perfectly acceptable to require the plugin be written in a certain language and have other requirements (for example the return code of the custom script/plugin) to make it more easily to be \"plugged-in\" to checkmate/capture and to keep the system running efficiently.", "I think that we need the ability to group uptime and infrastructure monitors together, ie) all of the VMs in one section, all of the websites in a different section, external sites in a third section etc. ", "Ability to have agents in remote sites that push so no port forwarding needed in remote sites as the agents will send a heartbeat so as long as the server is reachable from the agent it will work (a plus if the agent can be used as a probe to reach other devices in that network)", "> I think that we need the ability to group uptime and infrastructure monitors together, ie) all of the VMs in one section, all of the websites in a different section, external sites in a third section etc.\n\nI think tagging monitors won't work in this case - you want them virtually grouped on the dashboard, right? For me to understand your use-case better, is there an example of a user interface from another application? ", "It would be fantastic to have the ability to show infrastructure information on the public status pages. (as an aside, the use of the word \"server\" in the app can be confusing - my assumption of \"server\" was that it was one of my servers (hardware) and not one of my services that I monitor for uptime and such, so adding \"servers\" to the status page was confusing to me as the servers (infrastructure in the app) I had added were not available to be added)\n\nI'd love to be able to show my users some basics about the hardware behind the scenes. Storage capacity/usage over time, CPU/RAM usage. Likely not nearly as much data as on a proper private dashboard, but I don't see why not allow the user to pick and choose which components they have being monitored infrastructure-wise and display them publicly. \n\nMy personal example would be two on-prem servers and one VPS and giving some high level data to those looking at the status page. Bonus points if the monitored services can be displayed in such a way that they tie back to the relevant server hardware being shown.", "> > I think that we need the ability to group uptime and infrastructure monitors together, ie) all of the VMs in one section, all of the websites in a different section, external sites in a third section etc.\n> \n> I think tagging monitors won't work in this case - you want them virtually grouped on the dashboard, right?

In the above the group was set up as \"Docker Containers\", and each container was tagged separately with \"Docker\".  You can have one, both, or none.

Bravo.\n\nBasically when we are managing servers, we often want to have scheduled sleep time and scheduled wake-times. (this is often done in small setups, for power saving). We also want to be able to manually wake / sleep devices.\n\nSo if we can have a simple CLI cron runner in Checkmate (i.e., the backend server runs the cron job on its host computer), we can have:\n- Wake on LAN tool\n- Ping tool\n- Literally any custom CLI call which the admin wants to set (maybe they want to `sudo systemctl suspend` at 5PM everyday, and then Wake on LAN at 9AM everyday)\n\nThese can be presented as buttons in the Three Dot Menu, along with a few modals here-and-there for inputs (e.g. Cron scheduler, custom command call, etc)\n\n**Our current solution:**\nWe run a custom container in docker which makes wake-on-lan calls for us.

Looking at the official [Llama4 prompt format](https://www.llama.com/docs/model-cards-and-prompt-formats/llama4/#-image-prompt-format-), I should be getting out placeholder tokens for the image and image patches like `<|image_start|>`, `<|image|>`, `<|patch|>`. That's what I'm hoping this endpoint handles for me: calculating the patch-counts, etc as they'd *actually* be applied to my particular input image(s).\n\nThat's what I would expect the vLLM `/tokenize` to return to me. Especially since it's supposedly a [wrapper around huggingface-style tokenizers](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/serving/openai_compatible_server.html?h=%2Ftokeniz#tokenizer-api_1). Indeed, when I look at the [Llama4 huggingface tokenizer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/llama4#transformers.Llama4Processor), I should be getting stuff like `<|patch|>` out of that implementation as far as I'm aware. Am I simply passing stuff wrong?\n\n@DarkLight1337 I'm running the `vllm/vllm-openai:latest` docker image passing args: `--port 8000 --model /path/to/weights --tokenizer /path/to/weights --enable-prefix-caching --max-model-len 1000000 --limit-mm-per-prompt image=5 --load-format auto -dtype auto --kv-cache-dtype fp8 --tensor-parallel-size 8 --tool-call-parser llama3_json`\n\nMy output, when I go `input` --> `/tokenize` --> `/detokenize` --> `output`, looks like:\n```\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"<|begin_of_text|><|header_start|>user<|header_end|>\\n\\n[\\n{\\\"type\\\":\\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"Whats in this image?\\\"}, \\n{\\n\\\"type\\\": \\\"image_url\\\",\\n\\\"image_url\\\": {\\n\\\"url\\\": \\\"data:image/jped;base64,iSFHjlIEHVjALKSIk02k4j8KSF8jlkafLSKDJF...\"\n}\n```\nBasically, it's just escaping my messages array and then encoding the b64 as a string literal.\n\nWhat I would expect to see is something like:\n```\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"<|begin_of_text|><|header_start|>user<|header_end|><|image_start|><|image|><|patch|>...<|patch|><image_end|>Whats in this image?<|eot|><|header_start|>assistant<|header_end|>\"\n}\n```\n          ", "HF tokenizers don't process images.

      "description" : "## What would you like clarification on:\r\n\r\nHow to migrate an existing UWP project without destroying the existing folder structure.\r\n\r\n## Concern?\r\n\r\nIt seems the current documentation for migrating an existing UWP project to Uno Platform recommends destroying the existing folder structure by moving all files into the new Shared project folder. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/unoplatform/uno/blob/master/doc/articles/migrating-apps.md\r\n\r\nThis is undesirable for a number of reasons:\r\n\r\n 1. The existing UWP solution/project should still work and Uno should work along side it\r\n 2. The repository version history should not be significantly changed by moving all files over. It just creates complications tracking change history.\r\n 3. The existing folder structure of a project may already be used by existing scripts and other tooling\r\n\r\nIt seems to work just fine to modify the default Uno Solution files and then the shared project to instead point to a folder of existing code. For example, the following directory structure seems to work. The new Uno Folder could also be added at the same level of the existing Source folder.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\uD83D\uDDC0 Source                 : Existing UWP project and all of its files\r\n    ??? \uD83D\uDDC0 Uno              : New Uno directory for Uno project and build files\r\n    ???  ??? \uD83D\uDDC0 App.Droid\r\n    ???  ??? \uD83D\uDDC0 App.iOS\r\n    ???  ??? \uD83D\uDDC0 App.macOS\r\n    ???  ??? \uD83D\uDDC0 App.UWP       : Can be removed\r\n    ???  ??? \uD83D\uDDC0 App.Wasm\r\n    ??? UnoApp.sln          : New Uno solution\r\n    ??? UnoShared.projitems : New Uno shared project\r\n    ??? UnoShared.shproj    : New Uno shared project\r\n    ??? App.sln             : Existing UWP app solution\r\n```\r\n\r\nor...\r\n\r\n```\r\n\uD83D\uDDC0 Uno                 : New Uno directory for Uno project and build files\r\n    ??? \uD83D\uDDC0 App\r\n    ???  ??? \uD83D\uDDC0 App.Droid\r\n    ???  ??? \uD83D\uDDC0 App.iOS\r\n    ???  ??? \uD83D\uDDC0 App.macOS\r\n    ???  ??? \uD83D\uDDC0 App.UWP    : Can be removed\r\n    ???  ??? \uD83D\uDDC0 App.Wasm\r\n    ???

App.sln          : Existing UWP app solution\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe default UnoApp.sln, UnoShared.projitems and UnoShared.shproj need to be modified pointing to the new locations.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Usage in industry\r\n- [ ] Clarification of capabilities\r\n- [x] Getting started with Uno\r\n- [ ] Developing with Uno\r\n- [ ] Contributing to the Uno project\r\n- [ ] Publishing your application\r\n- [ ] Support\r\n- [ ] Other (please specify):\r\n\r\n## For which Platform:\r\n\r\n- [x] iOS\r\n- [x] Android\r\n- [x] WebAssembly\r\n- [x] macOS\r\n- [x] Skia\r\n  - [x] WPF\r\n  - [x] GTK (Linux)\r\n- [x] Windows\r\n\r\n## Anything else we need to know?\r\n\r\nI would be happy to update the docs myself if this is seen as a useful addition.\r\n",

Middleware authors using the 0.x versions of the `http` and `http-body` will be affected. The upgrade in both server and client going out in the same smithy-rs release would minimize user disruption. The server sdks being on these older dependency versions is causing quite a bit of pain for us as we attempt to migrate a couple large rust services to the smithy-rs server sdks from axum, which uses the newer http, hyper, etc. We are actively working on migrating the client runtime crates to Hyper 1, which should be released in the next few weeks. Following that, we plan to update the code generator to support Hyper 1 for both client and server-side implementations in a single release. We understand this dependency mismatch is causing difficulties for teams working across different ecosystems, particularly where some crates (like Axum) have already migrated to Hyper 1 while smithy-rs hasn't yet. We're working to minimize this transition period.",

      "comments" : [ "# :wave: Important: PLEASE READ :wave:\n\nThis issue has been labeled as a **good first issue** and is available for anyone to work on.\n\nIf this is your first time contributing to an open source project, some aspects of the development process may seem unusual, arcane, or some combination of both.\n\n1.  **You cannot \"claim\" issues.** People new to open source often want to \"claim\" or be assigned an issue before beginning work. The typical rationale is that people want to avoid wasted work in the event that someone else ends up working the issue. However, this practice is not effective in open source, as it often leads to \"issue squatting\", in which an individual asks to be assigned, is granted their request, and then never ends up working on the issue. Accordingly, you are encouraged to communicate your intent to address this issue, ideally by providing a rough outline as to how you plan to address the issue or asking clarifying questions, but, at the end of the day, we will take running code and rough consensus in order to move forward quickly.\n2.  **We have a very high bar for contributions.** We have very high standards for contributions and expect all contributions???whether new features, tests, or documentation???to be rigorous, thorough, and complete. Once a pull request is merged into stdlib, that contribution immediately becomes the collective responsibility of all maintainers of stdlib. When we merge code into stdlib, we are saying that we, the maintainers, commit to reviewing subsequent changes and making bugfixes to the code. Hence, in order to ensure future maintainability, this naturally leads to a higher standard of contribution.\n\nBefore working on this issue and opening a pull request, please read the project's [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md). These guidelines and the associated [development guide](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/docs/contributing/development.md) provide important information, including links to stdlib's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), license policy, and steps for setting up your local development environment.\n\nTo reiterate, we **strongly** encourage you to refer to our contributing guides **before** beginning work on this issue. Failure to follow our guidelines significantly decreases the likelihood that you'll successfully contribute to stdlib and may result in automatic closure of a pull request without review.\n\nSetting up your local development environment is a critical first step, as doing so ensures that automated development processes for linting, license verification, and unit testing can run prior to authoring commits and pushing changes. If you would prefer to avoid manual setup, we provide pre-configured [development containers](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/tree/develop/.devcontainer) for use locally or in GitHub Codespaces.\n\nWe place a high value on consistency throughout the stdlib codebase. We encourage you to closely examine other packages in stdlib and attempt to emulate the practices and conventions found therein.\n\n-   If you are attempting to contribute a new package, sometimes the best approach is to simply copy the contents of an existing package and then modify the minimum amount necessary to implement the feature (e.g., changing descriptions, parameter names, and implementation).\n-   If you are contributing tests, find a package implementing a similar feature and emulate the tests of that package.\n-   If you are updating documentation, examine several similar packages and emulate the content, style, and prose of those packages.\n\nIn short, the more effort you put in to ensure that your contribution looks and feels like stdlib???including variables names, bracket spacing, line breaks, etc???the more likely that your contribution will be reviewed and ultimately accepted. We encourage you to closely study the codebase **before** beginning work on this issue.\n\n:sparkles: Thank you again for your interest in stdlib, and we look forward to reviewing your future contributions. :sparkles:\n" ],

      "description" : "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\nWe are using SaltStack to manage OpenBao configuration, and we'd like to validate the OpenBao config file before starting or reloading the service. The closest existing feature is `bao operator diagnose`, which does parse the configuration file. However, it also attempts to initialize the storage backend, which can be unsafe or misleading when run via automation, especially if the service is not yet running or the backend is locked. This makes it less suitable for use in pre-start validation.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nA dedicated subcommand that performs only configuration parsing and validation, such as:\n\n```\nbao operator validate-config -config /etc/openbao/openbao.hcl\n```\n\nThis command should:\n- Return non-zero exit codes on parse errors.\n- Perform only config file parsing/validation.\n- Avoid initializing storage backends, telemetry systems, or listeners.\n- Be safe to run on stopped or uninitialized systems, as well as running instances.\n- Allow the config file to be specified as the last argument in the command line, so that it works with a temp file passed by SaltStack's check_cmd requisite.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\n- Using `bao operator diagnose -skip=storage`: this still attempts to initialize storage.\n- Wrapping `bao server -dev`: this seems brittle, and may behave differently in the future.\n- Wrapping `bao operator diagnose` and skipping validation entirely when the service isn't running: this works but sacrifices safety and/or functionality in first-time or immutable deployments.\n\n**Explain any additional use-cases**\n\n- CI/CD pipelines validating configuration changes before deployment\n- Pre-flight checks during provisioning of new clusters or cluster nodes\n- GitOps workflows that want to dry-run HCL validation before applying config\n- Admins validating config changes without disrupting live OpenBao instances\n\n**Additional context**\nOutput of `bao operator diagnose` on a running instance of OpenBao 2.3.1 with a valid config file:\n```\npmcconnell@openbao001:~$ sudo -u openbao bao operator diagnose -config /etc/openbao/openbao.hcl\nOpenBao v2.3.1 (e3cdbbde8eb48fb7ae92b1d34afb63012e805233), built 2025-06-25T19:20:49Z\n\nResults:\n[ failure ] Vault Diagnose\n  [ success ] Check Operating System\n    [ success ] Check Open File Limits: Open file limits are set to 1048575.\n    [ success ] Check Disk Usage: / usage ok.\n  [ success ] Parse Configuration\n  [ failure ] Check Telemetry: incomplete Stackdriver telemetry configuration, missing stackdriver_project_id\n  [ failure ] Check Storage: Diagnose could not initialize storage backend.\n    [ failure ] Create Storage Backend: Error initializing storage of type raft: failed to create fsm: failed\n      to open bolt file: timeout\n\npmcconnell@openbao001:~$ echo $?\n4\n```",

      "description" : "### \uD83D\uDD0D Feature Description\n\nIn the following image, the first row is selected and I'm hovering over the second row. The background color is (almost?) the same:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f04e3ad-ba05-41a6-ac97-2da1946f3aa7)\n\nIt would be good to be more visually obvious when a row is selected vs. hovered.\n\nExample code:\n\n```python\nimport taipy.gui.builder as tgb\nfrom taipy import Gui\n\ndata = {\"a\": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], \"b\": [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]}\n\nselected = [0]\n\n\ndef num_on_action(state, var_name, payload):\n    index = payload.get(\"index\")\n    if index in state.selected:\n        state.selected = list(set(state.selected) - {index})\n    else:\n        state.selected = state.selected + [index]\n\n\nwith tgb.Page() as page:\n    tgb.toggle(theme=True)\n\n    tgb.table(\"{data}\", selected=\"{selected}\", on_action=num_on_action)\n\n    tgb.table(\"{data}\", selected=\"{selected}\", on_action=num_on_action, class_name=\"rows-similar rows-bordered\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    gui = Gui(page=page)\n    gui.run(run_browser=False, use_reloader=True)\n```\n\nPlay around with:\n1. Changing the theme\n2. Selected different rows\n3. Hovering over different rows\n\nI quickly get very confused with the colors. It's much better on the table with \"rows-similar\" though.\n\n### \uD83D\uDCA1 Proposed Solution\n\nOverhaul the stylekit for taipy tables. Consider interaction with:\n1. Theme\n2. \"rows-similar\" stylekit class\n3. \"selected\" rows (Mui-selected)\n4. Hovering on selected/unselected rows\n\nConsider adding:\n1. Different background color for table header row\n\n### \uD83D\uDCDC Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I have checked the [existing issues](https://github.com/Avaiga/taipy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+) to avoid duplicates.\n- [ ] I am willing to work on this issue (optional)\n\n### ??? Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] A working demo or example code (if applicable) is provided.\n- [ ] Integration tests demonstrate the new functionality.\n- [ ] Any new code is covered by unit tests.\n- [ ] Code coverage remains at least 90%.\n- [ ] Related documentation updates and release notes are created.",

Forked and cloned the repository, then searched the codebase for `readline` usage to find the core input handling logic.\n2.  Identified `useKeypress.ts` (for raw keypress events) and `InputPrompt.tsx` (for input logic) as the key files.\n3.  To see what the application receives, I temporarily modified the code to log every keypress event to a `debug.log` file.\n4.  **Key Finding:** My initial debugging proved that on a default macOS Terminal, `Shift+Enter` sends the exact same sequence (`\\r`) as a regular `Enter` press, making the two indistinguishable.\n\n### Attempted Fix & The Final Discovery\n\nBased on the initial finding, I attempted a code-only fix by teaching the application to listen for a different key combination, `Shift+Down`, which often sends a unique sequence on other terminals.\n\n1. The Code I Tested\nI modified `useKeypress.ts` to listen for the `Shift+Down` sequence (`\\x1b[1;2B`) and `InputPrompt.tsx` to handle a `key.shift` flag.\n\n```typescript\n// In useKeypress.ts, I added a check:\nif (key.sequence === '\\x1b[1;2B') {\n  key.name = 'return';\n  key.shift = true;\n}\n```\n```typescript\n// In InputPrompt.tsx, I added the key.shift check:\nif (key.ctrl || key.meta || key.shift || charBefore === '\\\\' || key.paste) {\n  // ... newline logic\n}\n```\n\n2. The Result: It Also Failed\nThis proof-of-concept did not work. To understand why, I used the `cat` command to see what my terminal was actually sending when I pressed `Shift+Down`.\nFinal Proof: The terminal sent `^[[B`, which is the standard escape code for a plain Cursor Down key.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis investigation leads to a definitive conclusion: the default macOS Terminal is more limited than anticipated. It appears to strip the `Shift` modifier information from both the `Enter` key and the arrow keys, making a code-only fix for a `Shift+Key` newline combination unfeasible on this specific platform, although i think this might work on other platforms which by default register shift + down as '\\x1b[1;2B' but i cant really test it.\n\nThis might explain why `Ctrl+J` is a common suggested alternative, as it sends a universal newline character (`\\n`) that doesn't rely on modifier key parsing.\n\nAs this is my first contribution, my analysis could be wrong, and I apologize for the detailed-but-failed attempt. Given these findings, what is the desired path forward? Any information from the internal `b.corp.google.com` link about how other terminals are supported would still be very helpful.\n\nThank you for your time and guidance.", "Just to add, I personally use the Warp Terminal on Mac.

Initially, verify the email address, which should proceed smoothly. \r\n- Next, attempt to verify the phone number, Despite the successful verification of the email address, the system incorrectly indicates that the user is unverified when verifying the phone number. \r\n- In an attempt to rectify this inconsistency, proceed to unverify the phone number. Unexpectedly, the system now displays an alert indicating that the user is verified, contradicting the initial indication of being unverified.\n\n### \uD83D\uDC4D Expected behavior\n\n- When the user hits **Verify Phone**, the alert should confirm that the `user is verified`.\r\n- When the user hits **Unverify Phone**, the alert should confirm that the `user is unverified`.\n\n### \uD83D\uDC4E Actual Behavior\n\nWhen attempting to **verify the phone numbe**r, an alert incorrectly states that the `user is unverified`. \r\nHowever, when attempting to **unverify the phone**, the system incorrectly indicates that the `user is verified.`\n\n### \uD83C\uDFB2 Appwrite version\n\nVersion 1.4.x\n\n### \uD83D\uDCBB Operating system\n\nWindows\n\n### \uD83E\uDDF1 Your Environment\n\n_No response_\n\n### \uD83D\uDC40 Have you spent some time to check if this issue has been raised before?\n\n- [X] I checked and didn't find similar issue\n\n### \uD83C\uDFE2 Have you read the Code of Conduct?\n\n- [X] I have read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/appwrite/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)",

", "Hi, I am working on this!\n", "Hi, I'm working on this.", "> Hi, I'm working on this.\n\nOur team was able to reproduce the bug:\n\n\"When attempting to verify the phone number, an alert incorrectly states that the user is unverified.\nHowever, when attempting to unverify the phone, the system incorrectly indicates that the user is verified.\"\n\nThis looked like a condition logic flaw to us.  We then found the condition that was causing the flaw [here](https://github.com/appwrite/console/blob/main/src/routes/(console)/project-%5Bregion%5D-%5Bproject%5D/auth/user-%5Buser%5D/updateStatus.svelte#L49)\n\nWhich was missing a bang.\n\n[stnguyen90](https://github.com/stnguyen90) mentioned the desired behavior:\n\tXYZ's email has been verified\n\tXYZ's email has been unverified\n\tXYZ's phone has been verified\n\tXYZ's phone has been unverified\nNote:\n  The \"s\" should only be there if the name does not end with s. For example, if the user's name was \"Charles\", it should be \"Charles' email has been verified\"\n\nWe implemented a solution that met these requirements by changing this [code](https://github.com/appwrite/console/blob/main/src/routes/(console)/project-%5Bregion%5D-%5Bproject%5D/auth/user-%5Buser%5D/updateStatus.svelte#L48-L50)\n\nTo this code:\n`message: ${$user.name || $user.email || $user.phone || 'The account'}${( $user.name || $user.email || $user.phone || 'The account' ).endsWith('s') ? \"'\" : \"'s\"} email has been ${!$user.emailVerification ? 'unverified' : 'verified'},`\n\nOur team then implemented the same solution to updateVerificationEmail() as well, as seen [here](https://github.com/appwrite/console/pull/2112/files)\n\nThis solution can be tested just as [gurjeetsinghvir](https://github.com/gurjeetsinghvirdee) shows in the video posted to this issue.  Under a project, select Auth. In Auth, select or create a user that has both an email and a phone number. Select the 'Verify account' option and then verify the phone number and email. The correct alerts will be displayed.\n\nHere is out PR: [fix-1392](https://github.com/appwrite/console/pull/2112)\n\nDid we approach this issue correctly?  Shoutouts to my teammate @anthonythang1", "@toukirkhan would love to get an update or status here, thank you :)\n\n@MicahHeneveld , my apologies for the misunderstanding, Toukirkhan already mentioned he's working on it (and sent me a DM about it that his team is also working on it with him to prepare a PR). I just forgot to assign it on time. If Toukirkhan cancels or does not continue, we will review your PR next.\n\nWe also updated the contributor guide to be more clear on the proper steps before putting in a PR for next time, since there were 3 people working on a PR the same time. (not a bad thing, right?) :)  I appreciate your efforts and hoping to see more from ya :) ", "We discussed this again internally and we want to avoid the awkward \"'s\" and \"unverified\" so the desired behavior is:\n\nWe want to update the alerts to be specific to say:\n\nif name exists and isn't empty:\n> The email for XYZ has been verified\n> The email for XYZ is no longer verified\n> The phone for XYZ has been verified\n> The phone for XYZ is no longer verified\n\nif name does not exist or is empty:\n> The email has been verified\n> The email is no longer verified\n> The phone has been verified\n> The phone is no longer verified\n\nAs a reminder, the code that needs to be updated is here:\n\nhttps://github.com/appwrite/console/blob/4538dbb7efab8465cf9ba63282522bc686c70659/src/routes/(console)/project-%5Bregion%5D-%5Bproject%5D/auth/user-%5Buser%5D/updateStatus.svelte#L18-L61" ],

However, we notice that there was no notifications being sent to the Slack channel that was set up and we found this error:\n\n<img width=\"1920\" height=\"240\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4ba580f-dfe8-45df-87ec-716ea2f5693b\" />\n\n\nWe assumed that this error meant that this.app isn???t assigned in the following code block, and that when the program tries to read the properties of .client it gives the error.\n<img width=\"459\" height=\"136\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7632d3b7-96a2-496e-832a-a01c90ca1f6c\" />\n\nWe found that this value is supposed to be defined in the constructor, but that because of the if statement, it was never being defined. We tried to force it to run by removing the if statement to run, but we got the following error below because this.integration is undefined at the time of the constructor running.\n\n<img width=\"509\" height=\"260\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/985bddd2-fc10-4aff-a37e-e5ca40f03718\" />\n\n\n**Error caused by removing the if statement in the constructor**\n<img width=\"1463\" height=\"103\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6c0c4e4-57c1-4e80-9cbd-5cec294b373a\" />\n\nTo try and fix this, we moved the entire if statement into the init() function, since the init function is run in the integration.service file after the IntegrationFactory.createIntegration() function that sets the value of this.integration. After doing this, the if statement does pass, but we get the following error stating that the decryptMetadata function is receiving an object instead of a Buffer, ArrayBuffer, Array, or Array-like Object.\n\n**Error caused by moving the entire if statement out of the constructor to the init() function so that it runs after integration is defined**\n<img width=\"1969\" height=\"335\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50b1ba90-8c55-4e33-a8b3-005ea42467d7\" />\n\nWe wanted to reach out and see if this error is something on our side only or if the Slack integration is not working right now, because we won???t be able to test if our new init() function is working without the integration set up. If this is a known problem or if you have any advice about how to fix it, please let us know.\n" ],

The current SDK  uses uppercase and hyphens in the header names, which leads to this metadata validation error.\n\nTo fix it we need to change \n\n### 1. In client.py\n\n```python\n# gRPC authentication headers (from Go SDK)\nHEADER_CALLER_ID = \"ONLINE-FEATURE-STORE-CALLER-ID\"\nHEADER_CALLER_TOKEN = \"ONLINE-FEATURE-STORE-AUTH-TOKEN\"\n```\n\nto \n\n```python\n# gRPC authentication headers (from Go SDK)\nHEADER_CALLER_ID = \"online_feature_store_caller_id\"\nHEADER_CALLER_TOKEN = \"online_feature_store_auth_token\"\n```\n\n### 2. On server side on middle-ware we need to handle accordingly for extracting and authenticating headers\n```go\nonst (\n\tAuthToken       = \"AUTH_TOKEN\"\n\tcallerIdHeader  = \"online-feature-store-caller-id\"\n\tAuthTokenHeader = \"online-feature-store-auth-token\"\n)\n\nfunc ServerInterceptor(ctx context.Context, req any, info *grpc.UnaryServerInfo, handler grpc.UnaryHandler) (resp any, err error) {\n\tstartTime := time.Now()\n\tmd, ok := metadata.FromIncomingContext(ctx)\n\tif !ok {\n\t\treturn nil, status.Errorf(codes.InvalidArgument, \"mandatory metadata are missing\")\n\t}\n\tcallerId, ok := md[callerIdHeader]\n\tif !ok {\n\t\treturn nil, status.Errorf(codes.InvalidArgument, \"%s header is missing\", callerIdHeader)\n\t}\n\tauthHeader, ok := md[AuthTokenHeader]\n\tif !ok {\n\t\treturn nil, status.Errorf(codes.InvalidArgument, \"%s header is missing\", AuthTokenHeader)\n\t}\n```\n\nFor backward compatibility with go client we need to assume\n\n```go\ncallerIdHeader  as \"online-feature-store-caller-id\" | \"online_feature_store_caller_id\"\nAuthTokenHeader as \"online-feature-store-auth-token\" | \"online_feature_store_auth_token\"\n```\n", "@AryAgarwal  if you???re interested, feel free to raise a PR with the fix, it should mostly involve replacing the header keys options.

Do we want to group safety with intersections or with transportation? Arguably the intersections are a type of safety callout, but perhaps the point of separating the intersection callout toggle is to allow everything except intersections to continue being called out.", "That's a great point :-) Perhaps we split out all 3 separately? All the other Callout options are quite binary whereas this one currently incorporates 3 different types...so splitting them out will allow a person to fine-tune the information they wish to hear. It will increase the panel and require more scrolling for the page...but I think it's worth doing. ", "\nI could also argue that the safety spots callout should remain on unless the user decides to turn all callouts off. In the early days of Microsoft Soundscape, there used to be a toggle switch for the Location Updates callout, but starting around the early 2020's,the Location Updates callout became permanently turned on and cannot directly be configured by the user. My argument to leave safety spots on is so that the user is always aware of anything hazardous while walking around. That way the \"Manage Callouts\" menu wouldn't be cluttered with too many configurations. If we decide to go ahead with my solution, I also wrote a revision to the help documentation explaining \"Note: some callouts essential for safe navigation do not have their own toggle switch and can only be disabled with the \"Allow Callouts\" button.\" Anyway, having all three callouts in this section or just Transportation and Intersections will be an improvement, even for sighted users. The term Mobility isn't as intuitive for the average user.", "I can look into this ", "Do we know which files in the backend are connected to the different toggles that we want from the Mobility section?

You don't need to dive into how those settings are used by the `AutoCalloutGenerator` to filter the announcements.", "Just for clarification, I separated Transportation and Intersection into 2 different toggles. Before I make a pull request I want to confirm that we get rid of the Mobility toggle altogether and it just be the 2 new toggles?", "Based on your description, it looks like you are using my suggestion of leaving the safety callouts on permanently without a toggle switch. It might be a good idea to look at the advantages and drawbacks of the two suggestions. Would we rather have fewer toggle switches or a more customizable UI? My own suggestion has the safety callouts to not have a toggle switch so that the user is always aware of them in order to stay safe while walking. This may be good with cane or guide dog travel or for those individuals who are less experienced with O&M because a mobility device alone may not catch some safety spots. This solution also produces a less cluttered UI. You could argue in favor of the previous suggestion from Jchudge that having a toggle for safety callouts so the user turns off everything except for intersections may produce a more streamlined listening experience. That solution could be great for very experienced cane travelers who don't need that much guidance from Soundscape's callouts. The drawback is that the list of toggle switches looks a bit too long and overwhelming for beginners. Should we take a vote or something? Thanks.", "Mmm, I don't think we should make safety callouts permanently on.  There's a valid use case for the app  for low-vision non-cane users who don't need assistance finding steps and crosswalks but just want to hear road and shop signs they can't read.\n\nI'd suggest making three toggles, for mobility, transportation, and intersections. This shouldn't be much more difficult than two toggles, since the setting is already split into three under the hood.", "Thanks, since I don't object to having three separate toggle switches, should the new buttons be labeled \"Transportation,\" \"Intersections,\" and \"Safety?\" What should we do with the old \"Mobility\" switch? I assume that the \"Mobility\" or \"Safety\" button would be redundant if both buttons are in the UI so I think we can try either of two solutions. If we keep the \"Mobility\" label, and use the safety callouts for that label, then we should create an accessibility hint like \"Info for safe navigation.\" If you would rather go with \"Safety\" as the new callout name, the hint for the button could be written as \"Info for safe mobility.\" I can't come up with a good hint description right now, but you should get the gist. After everything is put together, the final list should be \"\"Allow Callouts,\" Places & Landmarks,\" \"Mobility\" or \"Safety,\" \"Transportation,\" \"Intersections,\" \"Distance to the Audio Beacon\" and \"Repeat Callouts.\" Maybe the order of callouts can be switched around a bit. Since the old \"Mobility\" hint said \"Intersection and Transportation Info,\" it may be better to put the \"Transportation\" button after the \"Intersection\" button for consistency.", "Ah, good point, the three categories should actually be Mobility, Safety, and Intersections. The \"Mobility\" category encompasses some random stuff that aren't directly related to modes of transportation, like ATMs and NaviLens codes.\n\nHere's a stab at the new hint text:\n* Mobility: Practical features like crosswalks and bus stops.\n* Safety: Potential hazards like steps and construction areas\n* Intersections: Announce street names and their directions", "So how I'm understanding what the final list should look like is this: \"Allow Callouts,\" \"Places & Landmarks,\" \"Mobility,\" \"Safety,\" \"Intersections,\" \"Distance to Audio Beacon,\" and \"Repeat Callouts.\" BTW, thanks for the new accessibility hints.", "> So how I'm understanding what the final list should look like is this: \"Allow Callouts,\" \"Places & Landmarks,\" \"Mobility,\" \"Safety,\" \"Intersections,\" \"Distance to Audio Beacon,\" and \"Repeat Callouts.\"\n\nYep, that sounds right to me.\n\n", "This message is for MBtheOtaku. I saw some of the changes in your \"Log Of Changes\" pull request, but it's better if you open a PR just for this issue. When you open up a new PR, be sure to put in the localized text for the new callouts and hints into the strings. That way, when it gets merged, I can be able to translate everything to Spanish on Weblate. BTW, I already have the text of Steinbro's hints in Spanish in my notes so I can just copy and paste.

Ideally, a developer could easily discover which argument matches which parameter without having to open up the file that contains `createPara()`.\n\nAs a follow-up, whatever is decided and implemented for this particular case could also be adopted as a new best practice across the app and added as documentation etc (this can optionally split out into its own Issue).\n\nPlease see the original description below from @katconnors / @canjalal  to understand the problem more and also refer to @canjalal's comment to see a potential solution.\n\n---\n\n## Context below from original PR (click through to see PR and discussion):\n\nArgument renaming in backend/routers for clarity (note that the original comment references case_manager, but naming is also in the para file as well)- see comment below from PR #433:\n\n\"This is a lot of arguments, whose values don't look like the names of the parameters.

All the post build and test workflows/ jenkins libraries use version as the key for parsing data from opensearch-metrics cluster. See sample [queries](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aopensearch-project%2Fopensearch-build-libraries+version%3A+%22%24%7Bthis.version%7D%22&type=code). However, data is indexed using build or dist manifest (in this case version=3.0.0-alpha1).\n\nIn order to retrieve the data, the version is retrieved from input manifest which is considered as the source of the truth. Because of this mismatch, it is now trying to run queries with `3.0.0` and returning no data. Example: https://build.ci.opensearch.org/job/integ-test-notification/3496/console\n\n### To reproduce\n\nSee the input manifest and compare with dist and build manifest.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe version across all the manifests should be same. Either pick `3.0.0` with qualifier as `alpha1` OR pick version: `3.0.0-alpha1`\nAccordingly modify the code base to accommodate this changes. \n\n### Screenshots\n\nIf applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.\n\n### Host / Environment\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```shell\n\n```",

I also looked at the new manifests from the build workflow and the assemble workflow, and the qualifiers are now a separated value. I am looking through all the manifest files, and I noticed that on top of the manifest, there are also the components within the manifests. Did the issue of separating the version also apply to the components within the manifests such as in https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-build/blob/main/src/manifests/build_manifest.py#L140? Another issue is when the workflows try to receive the data from the input manifest, and the version is indexed (without the qualifier), there could be multiple version-qualifier pairs for the input manifest that match the distribution or build manifests at that version. How could I run the sample queries to reproduce the original issue?", "Hi @ajleong623 Qualifier should exist on the top `build` level only.\n\nThe build.version represents the release version, ex: `3.0.0`.\n\nThen each component with its own version, which can be 3 digit `3.0.0` like OS and OSD core, or 4 digit `3.0.0.0` like any other plugins. We do not need to add a qualifier per component level because that is consistent across the board. Thanks.", "@peterzhuamazon understood. In that case, I think the pull request should be ready. Building from input and the assemble workflow now support qualifiers in the build and distribution manifests. " ],

      "description" : "There occasionally are \"small\" fixes for the generated docmentation. These range from \"fixing typos\" to \"fixing broken links\" or \"fixing type annotations\". These usually do not involve rigorous tests, because this _only_ refers to fixes that do _not_ affect the functionality. A corner case is that of TSDoc fixes that may affect the generated typings. These may warrant some scrutiny, but still are not covered by real specs, but maybe only by a few lines in the [`Specs/TypeScript/index.ts` file](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/blob/6e8b5d8fba959dd4df92c1aa4c69c6a62900aa0d/Specs/TypeScript/index.ts).\r\n\r\nI'd suggest listing these issues here. Everybody can add comments with things that have to be fixed, and we can try to keep track of the things that have been addressed using GitHub `[ ] Task checkboxes`.\r\n\r\n- [x] The `Cesium3DTileset.from...` functions claim to throw a `DeveloperError` when the tileset version is not `0.0` or `1.0`. (E.g. [`fromUrl`](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/blob/6e8b5d8fba959dd4df92c1aa4c69c6a62900aa0d/packages/engine/Source/Scene/Cesium3DTileset.js#L1933) and `fromIonAssetId`). \r\n  **Suggested fix:** This should include `1.1` as a valid version number. \r\n- [x] These functions are actually not throwing a `DeveloperError`, but a `RuntimeError`, as of [this check](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/blob/6e8b5d8fba959dd4df92c1aa4c69c6a62900aa0d/packages/engine/Source/Scene/Cesium3DTileset.js#L2122). \r\n  **Suggested fix:** Considering that the developer does not have influence on whether ~\"the data is valid\", it should probably be a `RuntimeError` (and documented accordingly)\r\n- [x] The `...GeometryUpdater#isDynamic` property documentation contains invalid links. (For example, the [`PolylineGeometryUpdater` documentation](https://cesium.com/learn/cesiumjs/ref-doc/PolylineGeometryUpdater.html#isDynamic), generated from [`PolylineGeometryUpdater`](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/blob/9f43e81832fd90a4d3e6b67f6b168b6131bf7ce6/packages/engine/Source/DataSources/PolylineGeometryUpdater.js#L259), but also other updater classes). \r\n  **Suggested fix:** It should just omit the part that says\r\n  ```\r\n   * If true, all visualization is delegated to the {@link DynamicGeometryUpdater}\r\n   * returned by GeometryUpdater#createDynamicUpdater.\r\n  ```\r\n  This is an implementation detail that is not relevant for the reader of the documentation.\r\n- [x] The [`EntityCollection#add` function](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/blob/9f43e81832fd90a4d3e6b67f6b168b6131bf7ce6/packages/engine/Source/DataSources/EntityCollection.js#L268) claims to throw a `DeveloperError` for duplicate IDs, but actually throws a `RuntimeError`.\r\n  **Suggested fix:** It should be a `DeveloperError`. The developer should make sure that there are no duplicate IDs. (In doubt, the developer can trivially check whether an ID is already present)\r\n\r\n- [x] The `orientation` property in the [entity constructor options](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/blob/7ea4b84b681cd17bc61a64921837d4380040ae24/packages/engine/Source/DataSources/Entity.js#L74) is documented to be of type `Property`, but it can also be a `Quaternion`.\r\n  **Suggested fix:** Change the type to `{Property | Quaternion}`. Investigate whether the same applies to other properties there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

And it claims that they are in a certain range. And it claims that `west` is the \"westernmost\" longitude. None of that is necessarily true. The `TilingScheme.rectangleToNativeRectangle` returns a `Rectangle` that uses degrees, for example. Methods that _receive_ a `Rectangle` usually don't say what unit they expect or which range they accept, or how they handle out-of-range cases. Methods that _return_ a `Rectangle` usually don't say what unit or range they provide. The 'east', 'south', 'west', and 'north' properties don't have a real \"meaning\" at this point.\n\nEdit after 9 hours of debugging: This does not only affect the _documentation_. Implementations, like that of the `width` getter, _assume_ that the statements from the documentation are true. But they aren't. The results of the computations of these functions are often plainly _wrong_. \n" ],

Write a brief description of how you will approach the task (without using ChatGPT).\n3. Add your Telegram handler in your application (e.g., in OnlyDust or similar)\n4. Write ETA in your application\n\n\n\n## What should I do if I have a problem\n1. Try to google it before asking. Googling is taking major part of dev work \n2. If you couldn't find answer your question with Google, text your question to [dev](https://t.me/spotnet_dev/4) group with your question.\n3. Do not send DM to maintainer, it would be better and faster to ask other contributors in chat \n\n\n## How to prepare PR\n1. Check if your code [smell](https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/smells) good\n2. Add `close #<issue number>` to link your issue with your PR\n3. Do not commit changes that are unrelated to your task\n4. Check after you created PR, if you committed everything\n\n\n## Task Description\n1. In the [admin endpoints](./blob/main/margin/margin_app/app/api/admin.py), add an endpoint called `/assets`. Call the [`Assets statistic` method from this issue](https://github.com/djeck1432/spotnet/issues/906) to retrieve the data. Format the response using pydantic BaseModel.\n2. Add integration tests for it.\n3. Ensure that all tests(workflows) and endpoint works properly.",

I have a small (very silly) question.\nThe `filter()` function in p5.js typically relies on its own built-in GLSL shaders. When you mention adding examples for p5.strands under `filter()`, do you mean writing a custom shader that leverages strands internally and showcasing that, and then using `filter()` function in the whole sketch created? I???m not quite sure how best to place strands examples inside the `filter()` reference?\n\nIn short, are you thinking creating sketches using p5.Strands and then using `filter()`? ", "> In short, are you thinking creating sketches using p5.Strands and then using `filter()`?\n\nI think so, to give users another potential way to discover strands (through looking up `filter`) in the examples.\n\nThere's a potential separate task we could do in the future where we replace the internal filter implementations with p5.strands versions, but I'll save that for a different issue \uD83D\uDE42 ", "hii, i am interested in this issue. can you please, assign it to  me\n", "Hi @pratham-radadiya ! This issue is pretty wide and probably is best done in multiple partial and independent PRs, can you describe the specific scope of a PR you'd work on first, if you're still interested in this? E.g., are you interested in creating some filters with p5.strands to add under filter? (Note that  some current filters might be not possible or very challenging to implement in strands, so it's totally ok to pick a few beginner-friendly examples to start with!)", "Hi @pratham-radadiya, thank you for your interest. I am currently trying to smooth this out a bit to make it easier to work on with a refactor. It should be ready to go this week. Making a filter would be a great place to start for now: the bloom filter here could be adapted:\nhttps://beta.p5js.org/tutorials/intro-to-p5-strands/\nIt's towards the bottom, with a blue spinning cube. Would you be up for that?", "Hi @ksen0 and @lukeplowden,  I'm really interested in this issue and would love to contribute, but I'm currently working on another issue in the p5.js repo, so I can't start right away ??? but once that???s wrapped up, I???d love to help out here.", "Hi @pratham-radadiya sure, comment here when you're ready, and @lukeplowden can then also update what the status is / assign! Until then, if anyone else volunteers, they'd be welcome to start work on the bloom filter.", "Hi @lukeplowden, @ksen0 \n\nI'm interested in contributing to this issue and would love to start by adapting the **bloom filter** example using `p5.strands`, as mentioned. I???ve reviewed the tutorial and the spinning cube example at the bottom, and I believe this would be a solid starting point.\n\nCould you please confirm if there's a preferred structure or any specific guidelines for adding this to the reference (particularly under `filter()`)? Once confirmed, I???ll get started and open a PR soon.\n\nThanks!\n\ncc @pratham-radadiya\n", "Hi @LalitNarayanYadav, thank you for the help. One place to do this would be in the `ShaderGenerator.js` file. Right after the `p5.Shader.prototype.modify = ...` function, just to group the documentation in with the rest of the strands stuff. [So, on this line here!](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/blob/6d4540ca85c461aaeedc7a85582b8fad685a8227/src/webgl/ShaderGenerator.js#L56) \n\nAlternatively, it could be [here](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/blob/6d4540ca85c461aaeedc7a85582b8fad685a8227/src/webgl/p5.Shader.js#L277C3-L282C21) with the original `p5.Shader.modify` functions.\n\n@davepagurek and @perminder-17 what do you think?\n\nAdditionally there was some talk on Discord of providing a `modifyFilterShader()`, `modifyMaterialShader()` or similar, but I dont think an issue was made for this. Regardless, the example here would be the same @LalitNarayanYadav, so a great place to start would be to adapt the bloom shader - perhaps trying to make it as succinct as possible? - and write up the accompanying text. If you make a draft PR for that in either location above, we can continue discussion from there. Let me know if you need any more information!", "Thanks for the feedback and suggestions earlier @lukeplowden @davepagurek! \n\nI've added the bloom filter example using `p5.strands` under `filter()` as discussed.  \nLet me know if the placement and structure look good or if you'd suggest any refinements.\n\nHappy to iterate further if needed! \n" ],

      "description" : "**TL;DR** make sure that `createRouter` and other exports are marked as deprecated. For the majority of packages there should only be one default export of the backend plugin itself. The `@backstage/backend-common` package is deprecated so usages of that package should also be avoided.\r\n\r\nBackstage???s [new backend system](https://backstage.io/docs/backend-system/) is ready for general use; we are now asking for a full transition over to the new backend system, which involves [stop supporting the old system](https://backstage.io/docs/backend-system/building-plugins-and-modules/migrating/#remove-support-for-the-old-backend-system). By old system we mean having exports of `createRouter` and related types. There should only need to be one export like [this](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/5d92499845e60e154b80481a679bfa3ec12f0dfb/plugins/notifications-backend/src/index.ts#L16) in the backend plugin???s `index.ts` file.\r\n\r\n## How do I help?\r\n\r\nRun `yarn backstage-repo-tools lint legacy-backend-exports` in the repository to get a full report of packages that require action.\r\n\r\n### Phase 1\r\n\r\n#### Ensure that plugins contain a default export\r\n\r\nEnsure that there is a default export of the backend plugin in `index.ts`, see [this example](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/5d92499845e60e154b80481a679bfa3ec12f0dfb/plugins/notifications-backend/src/index.ts#L16).\r\n\r\nIf the plugin previously had a default export in `plugins/<plugin-id>/src/alpha.ts`, make sure that that export is deprecated and that the default export is moved to the non-alpha `index.ts` instead.\r\n\r\n#### Deprecate `createRouter`, `RouterOptions` and similar types.\r\n\r\nHere???s an [example](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/26078) of a plugin???s `createRouter` being deprecated.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n/**\r\n+ * @deprecated Please migrate to the new backend system as this will be removed in the future.\r\n * @public\r\n * */\r\nexport async function createRouter(\r\n  options: RouterOptions,\r\n): Promise<express.Router> {\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Phase 2\r\n\r\n#### Remove deprecated exports\r\n\r\nEnsure that deprecations have been out for at one mainline release before proceeding with removal of all deprecated exports. Removing exports from one release to another is not recommended \r\n\r\nThe complete migration story for a backend plugin (including deprecation) is also mentioned in our [docs](https://backstage.io/docs/backend-system/building-plugins-and-modules/migrating#remove-support-for-the-old-backend-system).\r\n\r\nIf you take on migrating a backend plugin, feel free to add a comment in this issue to avoid duplicate work.\r\n\r\nWe plan to have all `createRouter` exports and `@backstage/backend-common` usages removed by the end of this year. Your help would be much appreciated!\r\n\r\n",

I was confused for a while looking at it because it seems to do nothing, except make the optional `HttpAuthService` compulsory. Actually I didn't understand it wrongly, this is indeed the state after the old backend has been torn down, e.g. inside the doc you provided:\n> In order to make the new auth services available to the plugin implementation in a backwards compatible way, we use the `createLegacyAuthAdapters` helper from `@backstage/backend-common`. This helper accepts both the old and new auth services, and returns implementations for the new ones. If provided with implementations for the new services it will pass them through directly, which is what we want for the new backend system.\n\nIn that case, the right thing to do is probably to chase the type upwards and make sure we always have:\n```ts\nhttpAuth: HttpAuthService\n```\ninstead of leaving it optional like:\n```ts\nhttpAuth?: HttpAuthService\n```\nCurrently that's not true and we shouldn't just blindly type assert with:\n```ts\nhttpAuth as HttpAuthService\n```\nwhich should cause issues down the road... ...", "@Teo-ShaoWei thanks for the nice explanation.

Would it have been easier if we take a step closer to the cliff first before the leap to the other side?\n\nLet me submit my PR and we look at it? If it's accepted, we can reduce the problem and at least can address #28969. Some of us are willing to slowly work on this, but our organization's Trivy can't. I'll understand if we decided to reject the PR in the end.", "Please, slow down and stop, you're rushing off an not clearly understanding things. If we wanted to moved forward with that PR - created by the Core Maintainers - then again we would have merged the PR I referenced. I'll copy the comment I've referenced a few times as it seems you aren't reading it:\n\n> So I don't think that this is going to work for some use cases.\n> \n> I think that it's wise for us to convert some of the extension points into serviceRefs instead, which then give us the ability to get access to the default implementations of some of the dependencies without having to export a load of things from the plugin as right now it's impossible to create a ClusterLocator outside of the plugin without copying a load of code.\n> \n> internally we have a requirement that the ServiceLocator needs access to the the ClusterSupplier which I think is pretty standard, but there's no way to create your own ServiceLocator without having access to the implementation of the ClusterSupplier but with extension points this is only possible if you create your own ClusterSupplier in the same scope.\n> \n> Moving these to ServiceRefs would mean that you could depend on the default implementation of the ClusterSupplier when overriding the ServiceLocator with your own.\n\nYou're changes don't address this and lead to problems for adopters. The above needs to be addressed first.\n\nI appreciate that you want to work on this but it needs to be done correctly and in a thought out way. Any security issues with `@backstage/backend-common` can be resolved with `resolutions` this is what the vast majority of the Community has done as they wait for this work. ", "Frankly I could be wrong as I'm really new to this piece of code, so just some quick intuition from me.\n\nTo me #29015 is a big change, and can be abstractly separated into three parts (A + B + C).\n\nA = changes that doesn't affect logic at all, e.g. refactorings like removal of `@backstage/backend-common`.\nB = changes in API that are small and users can fix easily, e.g. removal of the `DiscoveryService`.\nC = changes in logic that result in change of existing workflow, e.g. removal of `KubernetesBuilder` and all the helper functions within, so users would need to use what the new backend offers.\n\nI would believe that https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/29015#issuecomment-2753556148 is about the concern that we are not ready to make the change C, because users can't rework their existing workflow.\n\nWe are talking across each other this whole time because I guess this is what's on our mind:\n@awanlin: \"We didn't accept change A + B + C last time. Did you realized that the problem is this big and you haven't address the issue yet?\"\n@Teo-ShaoWei: \"I've derived A + B. Ah yes I think we can't solve C yet... Since the existing blocker is due to C, let's commit A + B first since users will be ok. We can then isolate and solve C.\"\n\nDid I understand the issue incorrectly?", "Sorry if I come off as confrontational. I really appreciate the good work of the core maintainers & the Spotify folks. Backstage is some awesome stuff!\n\nAnd it's because of that, my organization want to give it a serious try, so I would also hope to do what I technically can to maximize our mutual benefits. I'm currently still inclined to believe that #30653 is such an improvement for us, but I'll be glad if I can be proven wrong. With that, I hope that the PR can get a well-thought review \uD83D\uDE4F", "No worries @Teo-ShaoWei, the issue is trying to move before having an agreed upon course of action. Sometimes going slow can be fast in the end. I agree with the incremental approach, this is why I approved the Logger PR and worked to get the Kubernetes Plugin owner to approve as well. But what remains is a bit overlapping and I would prefer we get confirmation before taking further steps.\n\nSome additional background, it's the summer time so many people from the project are away so getting this fully reviewed and merged will take time and likely won't make the next month release which is August 19th. So getting this right from the start will help make sure it moves forward with less blocking points.", "@Teo-ShaoWei all good take it. I just started and reading up on the code since it's the first time for me seeing backstage from the inside. Happy to have a look at your PR to understand the ins and outs :-) " ],

      "description" : "### JabRef version\n\n6.0-alpha2\n\n### Operating system\n\nWindows\n\n### Details on version and operating system\n\nWindows 11\n\n### Checked with the latest development build (copy version output from About dialog)\n\n- [x] I made a backup of my libraries before testing the latest development version.\n- [x] I have tested the latest development version and the problem persists\n\n### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\n\n1. Start JabRef\n2. Start a LibreOffice Writer document instance\n3. Connect to the document instance from JabRef's OO/LO panel\n4. Open a new library\n5. Add the following entries to your library:\n```bibtex\n@Article{????2025,\n  author = {????},\n  title  = {You},\n  year   = {2025},\n}\n\n@Article{??2025,\n  author = {??},\n  title  = {I},\n  year   = {2025},\n}\n```\n6. Select a CSL style from the \"Select Style\" dialog of the OO/LO panel\n7. Cite any of the above entries\n8. Click the \"Make/Sync\" bibliography button from the OO/LO panel (not needed if `OO Panel->Settings->Automatically sync bibliography` is enabled)\n\nYou will observe the following exception (see appendix) along with the error dialog:\n```plain\nNo cited entries found in the document.\n```\nAnd log:\n```plain\n2025-06-10 22:32:55 [JavaFX Application Thread] org.jabref.logic.openoffice.ReferenceMark.parse()\nWARN: CSLReferenceMark: name=JABREF_????2025 CID_1 e2b1z2jv does not match pattern. Assuming random values\n```\n\n### Cause\nNon-Latin characters are not recognized valid in the \"reference marks\" format used for LO/OO in JabRef\n\n### Hints to solve\nAdapt the regex in:\nhttps://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/1ba35d20dbdd0b4aac33e1e594269d76302791b0/jablib/src/main/java/org/jabref/logic/openoffice/ReferenceMark.java#L18-L19\n\n### Pre-requisite context for people not familiar with this aspect of JabRef:\n**OO/LO integration:** https://docs.jabref.org/cite/openofficeintegration\n**CSL styles - citing and generating bibliographies:** https://blog.jabref.org/2024/08/26/GSoC-CSL/\n**\"Reference marks\" in LibreOffice:** https://devdocs.jabref.org/code-howtos/openoffice/overview.html (may be slightly outdated but conceptually valid).\n\n### Test for completion:\nScreen recording of bibliography being successfully generated in the document from the entries mentioned.\n\n### Appendix\n\n...\n<details>\n\n<summary>Log

If someone is assigned to the issue or claimed to be working on it, ping the person. After one week without a response, the assignee may be changed.\n1. Leave a comment indicating that you are working on the issue, or just create a [pull request](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pulls) after following the steps below. [Mention](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) this issue in the description of the pull request.\n1. Fix the issue locally.\n1. [Run the test suite](https://llvm.org/docs/TestingGuide.html#unit-and-regression-tests) locally. Remember that the subdirectories under `test/` create fine-grained testing targets, so you can e.g. use `make check-clang-ast` to only run Clang's AST tests.\n1. Create a Git commit.\n1. Run [`git clang-format HEAD~1`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html#git-integration) to format your changes.\n1. Open a [pull request](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pulls) to the [upstream repository](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project) on GitHub.

This is a list of all the nodes that SDAG tries to handle and their current status is GISel. Some nodes have no equivalent in GISel. Missing nodes will presumably need to be ported over, under the assumption that they will eventually be useful somewhere. Some of the examples like https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/141933 and https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/142355 make a good example of what kind of thing needs to be added and how tests can be written.\n\n|SDAG computeKnownBits | Status |\n| --- | --- |\n| MERGE_VALUES| Not relavant |\n| SPLAT_VECTOR | [Done](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/139501) |\n|

That's why we are discussing it. We recently added a new `<containers>` section which imports locally embedded container archives to the local container registry via a systemd oneshot service. But this functionality is\nexclusively connected to the container import feature (see #2663 ) The produced unit file also only has the task to import container archives into the local registry and not more. The feature we are discussing here is an arbitrary firstboot code that gets executed by *some* system on first boot.

Implement Settings Page UI and Routing\n\n---\n\n### Description:\n\nThe `/settings` route on the [Develevate AI](https://develevate-ai.vercel.app/settings) deployment is currently inaccessible. Navigating to this path results in a blank or unresponsive page, suggesting that the route is either misconfigured or lacks a corresponding component.\n\nThis affects the user experience by preventing access to essential account settings and preferences.\n\n---\n\n###  Steps to Reproduce:\n\n1. Go to [https://develevate-ai.vercel.app](https://develevate-ai.vercel.app)\n2. Navigate to `/settings` via the UI or directly enter the URL.\n3. Notice the page is blank or non-functional.\n\n---\n\n### Expected Behavior:\n\nA fully functional **Settings** page should:\n- Load correctly when navigating to `/settings`\n- Include sections such as:\n  - Profile Information\n  - Account Preferences\n- Follow the app???s overall design language (responsive and accessible)\n\n---\n\n### Proposed Solution:\n\n- Create a dedicated `Settings` component/page\n- Register the route properly within the application???s routing logic\n- Add appropriate sections for user management\n- Ensure mobile responsiveness and UI consistency\n\n---\n\n### Additional Context:\n\nThis enhancement will add critical functionality to the platform and improve overall usability by enabling users to manage their account settings.\n\n---\n\n### Assignment Request:\n\nI am a contributor under **GSSoC 2025** and would like to take up this issue as part of the program. Kindly assign it to me so I can begin working on the implementation.\n",

      "comments" : [ "Hi!\n\nI'm quite surprised that you reached the limits of Kafka by collecting events with OpenWEC. Out of curiosity, could you share an estimate of how many machines you are collecting events from and what your traffic is like (e.g. number of events, byte rate)?\n\nI don't understand how increasing the number of topics would improve performance (except if you have only one partition per topic). Could you share a documentation or an article stating about that? \n\nI would rather suggest to:\n- increase the number of partitions in your topic\n- increase the number of nodes in the Kafka cluster (at least one partition per node)\n- improve the storage technology used to store Kafka partitions (SSD)\n- tweak producer(s) configuration (batch size for example)\n- tweak consumer(s) configuration\n- tweak topic configuration (e.g. partition size, partition retention time)\n\n", "Hi! I am from Brian's team. We have 100k+ workstations and ~5500 servers that we going to collect from. \n\nIf there is a substantially huge volume on one single topic, it fills up the disk unevenly on a Kafka cluster.  This makes the team go into maintenance mode, rebalancing partitions which is tedious, sometimes error prone and time consuming all while hoping we don't miss realtime logs. So we have retention time and retention bytes applied to the partition. This keeps the busy work from us. But this means we need to monitor the volume and split the topic into more as they reach a certain level otherwise retention time criteria is not met.\nOur consumers scaling logic is shared across all log sources including wef. They all(300+) scale for up to 24 partitions so we don't have to handle scaling on case by case basis.\n\nSo we keep it fixed to 24 and make new topics if we reach more volume(message/sec) or more size(bytes/sec) than a number.\n\nLong story short, one could use 100s of partitions in Kafka on single topic if we are building a new system just to process windows events but after having tuned all other bits and pieces of the system, an ability to load balance across topics would make our life easier.\n\nForwarders like winlogbeats, logstash, etc. provide some sort of scripting and variable name for topic etc.. that we use to split volume to multiple topics. Does openwec has similar capability? Hoping we could work around.", "Thanks for the explanations! I'm very interested in knowing how you deployed OpenWEC and how it behaves with that type of charge. \n\n> Does openwec has similar capability?\n\nWe don't have that feature yet.\n\nAs you mentioned, if the Kafka driver configuration contains multiple topics, the expected behavior is for the received events to be distributed fairly among the configured topics. This behavior does not seem to be implemented in the Kafka producer library itself, so we need to implement it ourselves. However, the Kafka producer library can send each message (e.g., a Windows event) to a different topic.\n\nCurrently, the Kafka driver is stateless. This means that we cannot use a \"global\" round-robin index to fairly rotate between topics without making significant changes to the Kafka driver logic and possibly impacting performance. The Kafka driver, however, receives a batch of events to send in a single \"write\" call (https://github.com/cea-sec/openwec/blob/main/server/src/drivers/kafka.rs#L84). Therefore, I think we can use a \"local\" round-robin index to achieve relative fairness. The idea is to start at a random position in the topics array and iterate through the array for each event.\n\nI prefer your second proposal of adding a \"topics\" parameter to the Kafka driver configuration that contains a pre-made topics list. This approach seems much easier to understand and less likely to be used incorrectly. Additionally, if both \"topics\" and \"topic\" are present, an error should be raised.\n\nDoes this approach feel reasonable to you? It does not seem difficult to implement. Would you be interested in implementing it?" ],

If anyone is interested in going through the list here (thanks for compiling it!) that would be appreciated!", "I don't mind giving it a try. I'll also look for more discrepancies as the above list is not complete.", "Thanks @SoundOfScooting , I have assign you this one. Thanks for the help :)", "I'm starting work on this and notice some other issues.\n\nAs mentioned in the issue, TypeScript errors at `import ... from 'p5'` because `exports` in `package.json` doesn't specify the path to the type files. This issue also occurs inside the generated declarations themselves (for example, p5 constants don't appear to resolve).\nI plan to include the following fix in my PR:\n(The other files in this list don't have corresponding declaration files to point to, so I'm not sure what to do about them.)\n```diff\n-    \".\": \"./dist/app.js\",\n+    \".\": {\n+       \"types\": \"./types/p5.d.ts\",\n+       \"default\": \"./dist/app.js\"\n+    },\n-    \"./core\": \"./dist/core/main.js\",\n+    \"./core\": {\n+      \"types\": \"./types/core/main.d.ts\",\n+      \"default\": \"./dist/core/main.js\"\n+    },\n```\n\nvscode(ium) also reports these syntax errors which can be made into other issues if necessary.\n* `math.js:37:14`: A rest parameter must be last in a parameter list.\nsrc: `   * @param {...Number} x Zero or more numbers, representing each component of the vector.`\n* `structure.d.ts:181:12`: '(' expected.\nsrc: `function p5: typeof p5`\n* `p5.Element.d.ts`\nFunctions and parameters named `class` are marked as syntax errors (methods named `class` are fine).\n* `2d_primitives.d.ts` & `3d_primitives.d.ts`\n`export default function(...)` in JS generates the declaration `export default function 2/3d_primitives(...)`, which is marked a syntax error.\n* #6660 (which has had multiple PRs attempted and none merged)", "Oh, it appears that I was mistaken that one of the `fill` overloads was correct.\n\nI've looked into it more thoroughly. The documentation comments correctly mark parameters as optional with `[]`, and `types/color/setting.d.ts` has optional parameters, but `types/p5.d.ts` and `types/global.d.ts` do not, so the issue appears to be with those portions of the generator scripts.", "Thanks for narrowing it down @SoundOfScooting! Are you interested in trying to fix the optional handling in that file too? It looks like it is currently trying to be handled here (possibly the broken cases are going through a different code path?): https://github.com/processing/p5.js/blob/2606c21ef4924bd995053193c1c8b66f3e014d25/utils/helper.mjs#L310\n\nFor reference, for the documentation on the website and for FES, it happens here: https://github.com/processing/p5.js/blob/2606c21ef4924bd995053193c1c8b66f3e014d25/utils/convert.mjs#L64-L65", "> https://github.com/processing/p5.js/issues/6660 (which has had multiple PRs attempted and none merged)\n\nI think none of them ended up merged because someone was working on it and we didn't want people to jump the queue, but then they later closed their PR without making revisions. So I think that one is open again to be worked on, I've marked it as Help Wanted and Good First Issue.", "Okay, I've fixed the main issue of optional parameters.\n\nBoth `generateFunctionDeclaration` and `generateMethodDeclarations` call the function `generateParamDeclaration`, but the former is using `funcDoc` (from \"unorganized\" data) and the latter is using `item` (from \"organized\" data), which the function is not correctly written to handle.\n\nOrganized parameters have a different format than regular ones:\nhttps://github.com/processing/p5.js/blob/2606c21ef4924bd995053193c1c8b66f3e014d25/utils/helper.mjs#L286-L290\n`generateTypeFromTag` actually strips `OptionalType`, so the detection in `generateParamDeclaration` fails. A simple fix is to change the detection to `param.optional || param.type?.type === 'OptionalType'`.", "hi @ksen0 is this open, should i give i a shot or not?", "The main issue here of missing overloads is already fixed in my PR (#7863), but it's not merged yet as I was trying to fix more problems with the TypeScript declarations and haven't yet commited the big changes or decided on the final design. \nI had taken a break from working on the PR for a while but plan to resume sometime soon to finalize the changes.\nSee also #7938.", "Thanks for the update @SoundOfScooting !\n\nSince someone is already working on it, @NalinDalal maybe you can find another open PR that does not have ongoing work yet?

I'm not quite sure I follow the issue here.\n\nOr is the problem that oldURL (pointed to location hash which used to be tainted) and newURL (points to location.hash which is tainted) are generally untainted?\n\nCould you provide a small test program? I'm unaware of said event, so a simple program highlighting its usage would be welcome. Even better would be a [mochitest](https://github.com/SAP/project-foxhound/tree/main/taint/test/mochitest) that showcases where we are losing taints as a PR ;) but an example would be required to look into it to better figure out what goes wrong here and what's the expected behavior.", "> Or is the problem that oldURL (pointed to location hash which used to be tainted) and newURL (points to location.hash which is tainted) are generally untainted?\n\nThat was my initial thought.\n\nI could provide a simple example of a potential privacy violation. Suppose that a website includes a tracker with the following code:\n\n```js\n<script>\n  // tracker.js\n  window.addEventListener(\"hashchange\", (e) => {\n    fetch(`https://tracker.com/?url=${encodeURIComponent(e.newURL)}`);\n  });\n</script>\n```\n\nIn this example, the tracker may be able to track user movements through sections (elements with specific IDs) of a page.\n\nHowever, I am not sure whether this example is realistic enough to justify the issue. I could do a quick research on that by monkey-patching those properties in order to taint their value using `String.tainted()`. Then, based on the outcome, we decide how to proceed with this issue.", "Hmm, the question I have is, oldValue I see where the attacker control angle is coming from. If i change the hash (i assume programmatically), is this under attacker control?\n\nI can have a look into the required effort to fix this, but I'm still not fully sure both are sources. Maybe I'm missing something as the Web is vast, heh.\n\n\nSmall note, you can pass a second parameter to String.tainted to manually determine a taint source. Not quite sure this is really documented in a visible way. ", "The fix should be comparatively easy; simply add the Source Marker functions to the [event creation logic](https://github.com/SAP/project-foxhound/blob/main/dom/base/nsGlobalWindowInner.cpp#L4490). \n\nI.e., `MarkTaintSource` from [nsTaintingUtils.h](https://github.com/SAP/project-foxhound/blob/main/dom/tainting/nsTaintingUtils.h). \n\nWhat I'm lacking is an idea of why and a) how the hash changes and b) who controls said change. If tainted data goes into the new hash, we should be able to track this, despite not having a dedicated source. Should that be a source if it is changed programmatically to a static value? I think one of the issues is that marking the old hash as a source is perfectly fine for the first time the event fires (i.e, the original hash), but for all subsequent hash changes, the old hash might not be attacker-controllable anymore? In general, I'd be grateful for 1-2 examples of code samples where the hash changes.\n\nIf this is something that is not attacker-controlled but useful for your research, we could consider marking it as a source but disabling it by default, if that's okay with @tmbrbr. I assume you use some form of browser automation, e.g., Playwright, where you can pass on Firefox preferences. Or you can monkey-patch it, as you said.\n\nI'm aware that this is probably related to a paper you are working on, so I see why you can't give too many details. If you want to discuss this in a more private setting, feel free to write me an email. We're super happy to help, but I'm not quite getting the full picture here, which makes it difficult to implement the change." ],

For my use case, I would settle for a flag generating errors is a rule hasn't been tested in a run (could be an informational entry in output).\r\n",

It would function as follows:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n\r\n# This subcommand would assist with `.json, .jsonl` files. The formats `.csv, .txt, .tsv, .xlsx` seem incompatible with this new format (I am open to suggestions here).\r\n# The new subcommand will perform the same operations that already exist:\r\n# - Checking for potential improvements (removing duplicates, verifying the presence of system messages)\r\n# - Generating a `file_prepared.jsonl` file suitable for fine-tuning\r\nopenai tools chat_fine_tunes.prepare_data -f <LOCAL_FILE>\r\n\r\n# Create a fine_tune job\r\nopenai api chat_fine_tunes.create -t <TRAIN_FILE_ID_OR_PATH> -m <BASE_MODEL>\r\n\r\n# List existing fine-tunings\r\nopenai api chat_fine_tunes.list\r\n\r\n# Retrieve the status of a fine-tuning job.

I noticed that all `openai api fine_tunes` commands were removed (although they are still mentioned in the [documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/legacy-fine-tuning/create-a-fine-tuned-model)).

The description text _must_ include reproduction steps with either of command-line SwiftPM commands, `swift build`, `swift test`, `swift package` etc.\n\n### Description\n\nWhen an error occurs during the build phase with the `swift build` command, `swiftbuild` build system uses `stderr` as output stream to report the error. `xcode` and `native` build systems use `stdout`. \n\nHere is the PR that discussed about this issue: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-package-manager/pull/8858\n\nMoreover `swift run` command uses `stderr` as output stream for all build system, leading to more confusion.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI expect a consistent output stream between build systems when an error occurs with `swift build` command.\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nWhen running the `swift build` command on a package with syntax error here are the different outputs:\n\n#### swift build --build-system swiftbuild > stdout-swiftbuild.txt 2> stderr-swiftbuild.txt\n\nStderr:\n```\n/Users/***/Desktop/Sample/Sources/Sample/Sample.swift:5:1: error: expected ')' in expression list\n\n^\n/Users/***/Desktop/Sample/Sources/Sample/Sample.swift:4:6: note: to match this opening '('\nprint(\"done\"\n     ^\nerror: /Users/***/Desktop/Sample/Sources/Sample/Sample.swift:5:1 expected ')' in expression list\n\n^\nerror: Build failed\n```\n\nStdout:\n```\nBuilding for debugging...\n19%: 1???/???10\n```\n#### swift build --build-system xcode > stdout-xcode.txt 2> stderr-xcode.txt\n\nStderr:\n```\n```\n\nStdout:\n```\n0%: Compute target dependency graph\nBuilding targets in dependency order\nTarget dependency graph (3 targets)\n0%: Gather provisioning inputs\n0%: Create build description\n0%: Build stat cache for /Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX26.0.sdk\n14%: Planning Swift module Sample (arm64)\n14%: Planning Swift module Sample (x86_64)\nexpected ')' in expression list\n\n^\nto match this opening '('\nprint(\"done\"\n     ^\nexpected ')' in expression list\n\n^\nto match this opening '('\nprint(\"done\"\n     ^\nBuild failed\n```\n\n#### swift build --build-system native > stdout-native.txt 2> stderr-native.txt\n\nStderr:\n```\n```\n\nStdout:\n```\n[0/1] Planning build\nBuilding for debugging...\n[0/1] Write swift-version-39B54973F684ADAB.txt\nerror: emit-module command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)\n[2/3] Emitting module Sample\n/Users/***/Desktop/Sample/Sources/Sample/Sample.swift:5:1: error: expected ')' in expression list\n2 | // https://docs.swift.org/swift-book\n3 | \n4 | print(\"done\"\n  |      `- note: to match this opening '('\n5 | \n  | `- error: expected ')' in expression list\n[3/3] Compiling Sample Sample.swift\n/Users/***/Desktop/Sample/Sources/Sample/Sample.swift:5:1: error: expected ')' in expression list\n2 | // https://docs.swift.org/swift-book\n3 | \n4 | print(\"done\"\n  |      `- note: to match this opening '('\n5 | \n  | `- error: expected ')' in expression list\n```\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1.

Check the commit log for the style used for other typing of test files (mainly by prah23).\r\n\r\nIt's likely worth working on one test function at a time in a separate commit, which we may squash together before merging. Once the file fully passes mypy cleanly, we can then move the first commit to the end, so that mypy doesn't complain before the file is fixed. That commit will then ensure that changes to that file will require type hints in future.\r\n\r\n> This is one element of #1229: please focus on this **one** file of that issue first, and if things go well, then you would be well situated to cover the remaining files later as followup PR(s).

You???re now officially **assigned** to this issue under the **GSSoC'25** program. \uD83C\uDFAF???\n\n---\n\n### \uD83C\uDFAF Objective:\n\nCreate a feature that allows users on **DevElevate** to easily access **DSA-specific problems** within the **Programming** section ??? filtered and served via a dedicated backend API, then displayed on the frontend.\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDCCC Implementation Requirements:\n\n#### 1. \uD83E\uDDE0 **Database (MongoDB Atlas add it here it will store the data after you test it in local host that it is storing the data add this to store online ok - pymongo.MongoClient(\n    \"mongodb+srv://abhisekpanda2004guddul:Y3pU0wNKOW8r1ea7@cluster0.0khgj.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0\"\n) \n\n* Use the `problems` or `programmingContent` collection (as per project structure).\n* Tag each document related to DSA with a `category: \"DSA\"` or `tags: [\"dsa\"]`.\n* Sample schema:\n\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"_id\": \"...\",\n    \"title\": \"Two Sum\",\n    \"difficulty\": \"Easy\",\n    \"category\": \"DSA\",\n    \"tags\": [\"array\", \"hashmap\"],\n    \"link\": \"https://...\",\n    \"createdAt\": \"...\"\n  }\n  ```\n\n#### 2. \uD83D\uDD27 **Backend (Node.js + Express)**\n\n* Create a **new GET endpoint**:\n\n  ```\n  GET /api/programming/dsa\n  ```\n\n* Logic:\n\n  * Fetch problems where `category === \"DSA\"` or contains `\"dsa\"` in tags.\n  * Return essential fields like title, id, difficulty, and link.\n\n* Example response:\n\n  ```json\n  [\n    {\n      \"_id\": \"1\",\n      \"title\": \"Two Sum\",\n      \"difficulty\": \"Easy\",\n      \"link\": \"https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum\"\n    },\n    ...\n  ]\n  ```\n\n#### 3. \uD83D\uDCBB **Frontend (React + Vite)**\n\n* Add a **filter option** in the Programming section: `View DSA Problems`.\n* When clicked, call the new API and display only DSA-tagged content.\n* Display in grid/list with:\n\n  * ??? Problem name\n  * ??? Difficulty tag (e.g. Easy/Medium/Hard)\n  * ???

      "description" : "Issue Description:\n\n **Problem**\nThe CodeClip application currently has a polished landing page but suffers from completely non-functional navigation. All header navigation links (`Home`, `Challenges`, `Editor`, `Profile`) point to `#` placeholders, and the main CTA buttons link to non-existent routes (`/coding`, `/challenges`). This makes the application unusable beyond the landing page and creates a poor user experience.\n\n### Current Issues\n- ??? Navigation links in header are dummy links (`href=\"#\"`)\n- ??? CTA buttons point to `/coding` and `/challenges` routes that don't exist\n- ??? No routing system implemented to handle page navigation\n- ??? Users cannot access any functionality beyond the homepage\n\n### Proposed Solution\nImplement a basic client-side routing system and create the essential pages:\n\n1. **Fix Navigation Links**\n   - Update header navigation to point to actual pages/routes\n   - Ensure CTA buttons lead to functional destinations\n\n2. **Create Missing Essential Pages**\n   - `pages/challenges.html` - Basic challenge listing page\n   - `pages/profile.html` - User profile/progress page  \n   - Enhance existing editor.html with proper structure\n\n3. **Implement Basic Routing**\n   - Add simple client-side routing logic in app.js\n   - Handle page navigation without full page reloads\n   - Maintain consistent header/footer across pages\n\nThis issue focuses on making the basic navigation functional, which is essential before implementing more advanced features like challenge data, code execution, or user progress tracking.\n\nPlease assign me this part\nThank you!",

      "description" : "### GitHub Username\n\nkyra-1\n\n### \uD83D\uDCCC Issue Title / Suggestion Summary\n\nBug: Password complexity rules are suggested by the UI but not enforced during registration\n\n### \uD83D\uDCDD Detailed Description\n\n## \uD83D\uDD0D What is the Current Behavior?\n\nThe current registration form (`register.html`) includes a **password strength bar** that visually represents the complexity of the password.  \nIt evaluates the following criteria:\n\n- Password **length**\n- Presence of **uppercase letters**\n- Inclusion of **numbers**\n- Usage of **special characters**\n\nBased on these, the bar changes **width** and **color** to indicate strength.  \nHowever, the form submission handler only validates the password's length (must be 8-20 characters) and that the confirmation matches.\n\n---\n\n## \uD83D\uDCA1 What Change Are You Proposing?    \n\nThe current registration form has a bug where it allows the submission of weak passwords like \"aaaaaaaa\". The password strength meter provides visual feedback on complexity by checking for uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters, but these rules are not actually enforced when the user clicks \"Register\". I am proposing a change to fix this by ensuring the password complexity rules are mandatory for successful registration.   \n\n---\n\n## \uD83C\uDFAF Why Is This Needed?\n\nThis is a functional bug that allows users to create weak and insecure passwords, defeating the purpose of having a password strength indicator and creating a security loophole in the registration process.\n\n## \uD83D\uDCAD Proposed Solution \n\nThe solution involves modifying the form submission handler within the register.js file. The validation logic that runs upon form submission will be updated to incorporate the complexity checks already used by the visual strength meter. If the password does not meet these required criteria, the submission will be blocked and an appropriate error message will be displayed to the user.\n\nI???ve reviewed the relevant files and am ready to begin. Please assign this issue to me if approved.\n\n---\n\n## ??? Readiness and Request\n\nI have reviewed the relevant files and am fully prepared to begin implementing this feature.\n\nIf this proposal is approved, I would appreciate being **assigned this issue** so I can start contributing to the improvement.\n\n\n### ??? Contributor Checklist\n\n- [x] I have searched and confirmed this issue has not been reported already.\n- [x] I am a registered participant of GSSoC 2025.\n- [x] I have starred the repository to support the project.\n- [x] I agree to follow the project's [Code of Conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).",

We have all these metrics in besu but sometimes we can see patterns where with the number of calls, we see different performances (see screenshots below). This is because, for eth_call for example, all calls are not equals, as they can use different amount of gas.\n1 `eth_call` can use as much gas as 1000 other `eth_call` requests, so using only the number of calls as a metric in this case is not sufficient. We need to add a new metric on the gas used to have a better overview of the applied load.\nIn the screenshots below, we can see that with the same load, there are different performances for some periods of time. Checking other metrics, we found that those calls are much more expensive and doing more disk accesses.\n\n<img width=\"1726\" height=\"638\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/208dae1f-4842-4f0b-a925-3d99c43daea4\" />\n\n<img width=\"1726\" height=\"623\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0c5d7e3-fe2c-4da3-b89f-d97ef4601158\" />",

      "description" : "### Describe the Bug\n\nPlease note that the embedded Material Icons library is so outdated that most of the icons we actually want to use are not available in Directus.\n\nDocumentation states \n\n> \"Select a custom icon from Google's [Material Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons) library to display next to your extension title in the listing and extension detail page.\"\n\nThe issue is, there is a constant back and forth of picking icons and trying them out only to see they don't work. \n\n### To Reproduce\n\nHere is a common example, on Google Material Icons page you can filter icons based on simple keywords of what you want. \n\n1. Filter using keyword \"prize\"\n\n2. Out of the following icons only 1 works:\n\n<img width=\"1071\" height=\"638\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7fc8c7d-93f8-4186-a759-78c54b6b5aa5\" />\n\n3. It means I have to go and try it, iterate back and forth between building and refreshing the browser several times to only find that \"millitary_tech\" is the only available icon in that list. \n\n\nThis is frustrating and counter-productive, an update could really go a long way. Another solution could be to use an npm package like [material-symbols](https://www.npmjs.com/package/material-symbols) that **auto-updates from Google's official set. It means the icons will stay fresh.**\n\n\n### Directus Version\n\nV11.9.2\n\n### Hosting Strategy\n\nSelf-Hosted (Custom)\n\n### Database\n\n_No response_",

Admin View Implementation Proposal\n\nI'd like to solve this issue by creating a comprehensive User Management system for the Admin View. Here's my detailed implementation plan:\n\nFrontend Implementation\n\n1. I'll create an `AdminUsers.tsx` component using Shadcn UI and Tailwind CSS, which will be linked to the `/admin/users` route.\n\n2. The component will include:\n   - A responsive data table showing user information (Name, Email, Role, JoinedAt)\n   - Search and filter functionality for easy user discovery\n   - Action buttons for each user (View, Promote to Admin, Ban User)\n   - Modal dialogs for user actions with confirmation steps\n   - Pagination for handling large user lists\n   - Export functionality for user data\n\n3. The component will use the existing AuthContext for data management and will implement proper error handling and loading states.\n---\nBackend Implementation\n\n1. I'll implement the following RESTful API endpoints:\n   - `GET /admin/users` - List all users with pagination and filtering\n   - `PATCH /admin/user/:id/promote` - Promote a user to admin role\n   - `PATCH /admin/user/:id/block` - Block/unblock a user\n\n2. I'll implement proper middleware:\n   - JWT authentication to verify admin tokens\n   - Role-based access control to ensure only admins can access these endpoints\n   - Error handling middleware for consistent error responses\n\n3. I'll update the MongoDB models as needed to support these operations.\n---\nSecurity Considerations\n\n1. All routes will be protected with JWT authentication\n2. Role-based middleware will ensure only admins can access these endpoints\n3. Input validation will be implemented on all endpoints\n4. Sensitive operations will require confirmation\n---\nTesting Strategy\n\n1. I'll test the complete flow on localhost before submitting\n2. I'll ensure all components render correctly and are responsive\n3. I'll verify all API endpoints work as expected\n4. I'll test error handling and edge cases\n\nI'm excited to contribute to this project and will follow all the development guidelines mentioned in the issue description.\n\n---\n\nLooking forward to your approval to start working on this feature!\n        ", "Hi @abhisek2004 , I'd love to work on this under GSSoC'25.\nPlease add the GSSoC'25 label, set a level, and assign it to me.\n@Avansh2006 ", "??? **Issue Assigned: \\[User Management Page ???

The message in the run log is:\n\n```\nERROR - Executor reports task instance <...> finished (failed) although the task says it's queued. (Info: None) Was the task killed externally?\n```\n\nChecking container logs shows that the worker is unable to communicate with the API server due to an SSL certificate verification error:\n\n```\nairflow-worker-1 | 2025-07-18 09:21:32.543021 [error] Task execute_workload[73ed6338-5c59-450c-8e6a-284d52e0cf60] raised unexpected: ConnectError('[SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: self-signed certificate (_ssl.c:1010)') [celery.app.trace]\n```\n\n#50726 mentions this and a possible workaround by assigning alternative names localhost and airflow-apiserver to the self-signed certificate then adding it into the container. I tried this and was unable to get it to work with the same error message.\n\n### What you think should happen instead?\n\nI think not working immediately is sensible but there should be a config parameter to disable certificate verification with suitable warning against doing so.\n\nThe setup should still work without needing to import the self-signed certificate to get it verified.\n\n### How to reproduce\n\nSetup Airflow as per https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/howto/docker-compose/index.html then add SSL with:\n\n```\nAIRFLOW__WEBSERVER__WEB_SERVER_SSL_CERT: <cert>\nAIRFLOW__WEBSERVER__WEB_SERVER_SSL_KEY: <key>\n```\n\nOr their equivalent new API versions.

This issue on httpx is relevant:\n\nhttps://github.com/encode/httpx/issues/302\n\nAs it stands there is no way to alter anything via environment variables as httpx uses certifi. It looks like a cert can be added using the verify arguement which would involve code change to the API SDK.\n\nI managed to get a self-signed certificate working by customising the image and appending it to the certifi bundle.\n\nI think a good solution would be to have the certificate used for the api-server added to the trust store.

      "description" : "Part of #12048\n\n## Issue\nAfter most of the Unit Test migration in #12048, there are a lot of inconsistencies in access control test methods. This is because we did not migrate the many convenient, abstracted, and commonly used access control test methods from `ui/webapi/BaseActionTest.java` to `sqlui/webapi/BaseActionTest.java`.\n\nAfter merging #13254, all of the access control test methods in `BaseActionTest.java` have been migrated. Hence, this issue aims to refactor the unit test access controls to use these convenient test methods.\n\n## Progress\nThe progress for this refactoring can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IcB-viJMrIOknYoBYasBuRBK9qnwY0-doEK4_Eb24IA/edit?gid=0#gid=0). I (the author) will update it when completed PRs are merged proactively.\n\n## Steps to Contribute\n\n1. Choose test(s) to work on in the above Google Sheets link\n2. Check that no on else have claimed the test cases to work on within the last 2 weeks, or that it has been completed by follow up PRs (but not updated in the sheets)\n3. Comment on this issue to indicate that you'd like to contribute on the chosen test(s). Update your comment if you need more than 2 weeks so that other contributors don't overlap with your work.\n4. Create a PR to refactor the unit test(s).\n5. Submit the PR, with a link to this issue by starting the description with \"Part of #13304\". \n6. Tag me or any other active reviewers and wait for us to review (so that we can get a notification)\n\n## Tips\n\n- Understand the access control test methods in `sqlui/webapi/BaseActionTest.java`, follow the refactoring in #13254\n- Most of the access control testing logic in the migrated unit tests under `sqlui/webapi` follows the old unit tests under `ui/webapi`, so you may wish to reference the old unit test for help",

After analyzing the codebase, the `are_site_fields_synced` method appears to be unused in production code and is only referenced in test files. Additionally, the `fetch_site_fields` method is only used internally by the unused `are_site_fields_synced` method, making it a candidate for removal as well.\n\nThis cleanup will streamline the Google_Proxy class by removing dead code that is no longer needed, reducing the maintenance burden and potential confusion for developers working with the authentication system.\n\n---------------\n\n_Do not alter or remove anything below. The following sections will be managed by moderators only._\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n\n* The `are_site_fields_synced` method is removed from the Google_Proxy class in `includes/Core/Authentication/Google_Proxy.php:384-398`\n* The `fetch_site_fields` method is removed from the Google_Proxy class in `includes/Core/Authentication/Google_Proxy.php:371-373` (since it's only used by the removed method)\n* All related test files are updated to remove references to these methods\n* No production code functionality is affected by these removals\n* Code documentation is updated if necessary\n\n## Implementation Brief\n\n* [ ] Remove the `are_site_fields_synced` method from the Google_Proxy class ([lines 384-398](https://github.com/google/site-kit-wp/blob/ac30b01bcedabc17e77ba957a2dbc4ccea5433ed/includes/Core/Authentication/Google_Proxy.php#L384-L398))\n* [ ] Remove the `fetch_site_fields` method from the Google_Proxy class ([lines 371-373](https://github.com/google/site-kit-wp/blob/ac30b01bcedabc17e77ba957a2dbc4ccea5433ed/includes/Core/Authentication/Google_Proxy.php#L371-L373)) since it's only used by the method being removed\n* [ ] Verify that all authentication flows continue to work properly after removal\n\n### Test Coverage\n\n* [ ] Remove the `test_fetch_site_fields` test method from Google_ProxyTest ([lines 154-190](https://github.com/google/site-kit-wp/blob/ac30b01bcedabc17e77ba957a2dbc4ccea5433ed/tests/phpunit/integration/Core/Authentication/Google_ProxyTest.php#L154-L190))\n* [ ] Remove the `test_are_site_fields_synced` test method from Google_ProxyTest ([lines 192-220](https://github.com/google/site-kit-wp/blob/ac30b01bcedabc17e77ba957a2dbc4ccea5433ed/tests/phpunit/integration/Core/Authentication/Google_ProxyTest.php#L192-L220))\n* [ ] Run full test suite to ensure no unexpected dependencies exist\n\n## QA Brief\n\n* Verify that users can still authenticate with Google services without issues\n* Test site setup and registration flows to ensure they work correctly\n* Confirm that existing authenticated sites continue to function properly\n* Test permissions and setup URLs generation to ensure no regression\n\n## Changelog entry\n\n* Remove unused `are_site_fields_synced` and `fetch_site_fields` methods from Google_Proxy class to reduce technical debt.",

I agree with Martin that there are issues with defining a good UX for that.\r\n\r\nSuch a feature could become unpopular for spamming `.gitignore` files with confusing entries, even if we do some basic optimizations. Then it might turn into a tempting target for scope creep to \"fix\" that. Also, it's not obvious to me that every `<pattern>` we might want to accept would map reasonably to `.gitignore` patterns. For examples of how that could get harder or more ambiguous in the future, see https://github.com/martinvonz/jj/issues/2915.\r\n\r\nI've occasionally imagined something like `jj [un]ignore <pattern>` that does this more directly, but it would have at least as many issues as doing it during `[un]track`.\r\n\r\nAnother detail we would want to consider is the UX for how we determine *which* `.gitignore` file we manipulate under which circumstances.

The ones that are considered explicitly ignored, whether this comes from a gitignore, from a `jj untrack`, or from being outside a sparse pattern (there might be other possibilities I forgot).\r\n2. The ones that are not ignored but `jj` thinks the user might not actually want to snapshot. `jj` would want an explicit user confirmation before snapshotting such files. These would be files >1MB (the current behavior of `jj` with these files is clearly imperfect; what I'm talking about here might not be a sufficient solution to the problem but seems like it could be a part of it); perhaps there are other files that fit into this category like cache files (#4409) or files with secrets.\r\n\r\nMy first thought was that we only really need to show the second category in `jj status`.

C# cannot always guarantee that a non-nullable reference will never contain a null. \r\nHowever, it can make the guarantee if certain constraints hold, and more generally it will significantly reduce the chances of encountering a NullReferenceException even in cases where it cannot absolutely rule this out.\n\n### Which area does this relate to?\n\nGovernance\n\n### Solution\n\nOn each projects .csproj file add inside `PropertyGroup` the new tag `<Nullable>enable</Nullable>`\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n``` xml\r\n<PropertyGroup>\r\n  <Nullable>enable</Nullable>\r\n</PropertyGroup>\r\n\r\n```\n\n### Acknowledgment\n\n- [X] This request meets [Lambda Powertools Tenets](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-lambda-powertools-dotnet/latest/#tenets)",

Preferably from the main deployment link.\n* Add a section showcasing all the respected contributors.\n* Ensure the **tech stack** is accurate and complete\n* Improve **formatting, styling, or sectioning** to make it more interactive and polished\n* Add or improve **badges, headings, emojis, spacing, or links** where needed\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDE4B Why You Would Want to Work on This:\n\n- Every valid PR will be considered for scoring under GSSoC???25.\n- Multiple contributors can take up this task in rounds (for different versions). It is a scoring Issue, if you stay updated.\n- Comment below and **wait for assignment** before raising a PR.\n\n---\n",

      "description" : "## Guideline\n1. Carefully read the issue description before applying to ensure you have all the necessary information to start working on it.\n2. Write a brief description of how you will approach the task (without using ChatGPT).\n3. Add your Telegram handler in your application (e.g., in OnlyDust or similar)\n4. Write ETA in your application\n\n\n\n## What should I do if I have a problem\n1. Try to google it before asking. Googling is taking major part of dev work \n2. If you couldn't find answer your question with Google, text your question to [dev](https://t.me/spotnet_dev/4) group with your question.\n3. Do not send DM to maintainer, it would be better and faster to ask other contributors in chat \n\n\n## How to prepare PR\n1. Check if your code [smell](https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/smells) good\n2. Add `close #<issue number>` to link your issue with your PR\n3. Do not commit changes that are unrelated to your task\n4. Check after you created PR, if you committed everything\n\n\n## Task Description\n1. **Update Endpoint Behavior**  \n   Refactor the `/admin/me` endpoint to return the currently authenticated admin's data.  \n   It should:\n   - Rely on the authentication token to identify the admin\n   - Return relevant admin fields (e.g. `id`, `email`, `is_super_admin`)\n   - Exclude sensitive data such as password hashes\n\n2. **Ensure Secure Access**  \n   Make sure the route is protected and only accessible to authenticated admin users.\n\n3. **Update Response Schema**  \n   Use a clear and secure response model to structure the output.\n\n4. **Write Tests**  \n   Add tests for:\n   - Authenticated access\n   - Unauthorized access\n   - Correct data structure\n\n5. **Verify CI Workflow**  \n   Ensure all tests pass and the workflow remains green.",

I???ve noticed that some 10-K reports place their financial statements separately, meaning they are not located in Item 8 or Item 16. Instead, they are placed at the end of the 10-K report. Could you please extract this section and create a new item (perhaps called \"financial_statement\") in the extracted file for such cases?\n\nI am aware that both types of financial statements usually start with \"INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\" or \"INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\" Maybe you can capture the section titled \"INDEX TO * STATEMENTS\" that appears after Item 16 and treat everything from that point to the end of the file as the financial statements section?\n\nHere are a few examples:\nADT: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1703056/000170305624000020/adt-20231231.htm\n\nATUS: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1702780/000162828025005486/atus-20241231.htm",

It does not happen always but it does happen sometimes.\n\nTbh, during this time period, I am busy with other stuff so I won't find time to contribute towards the software.\n\nHowever, feel free to introduce any PR yourself if you want.\n\nSome extra questions just to \"pinpoint\" this issue a bit better, so we understand the issue a bit better:\n- When statements are not found in item 8/15 (or 16 as you say), they are then found at the end of the 10-k report? This translates to \"after the end of item 15/16\"? can you get a bit more specific? BTW, Item 16 is optional. \n- Let's also think the other way around. In 10-Ks where the parsing right now is succesful, if you would search for these phrases \"INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\" or \"INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\", would you get anything returned? The problem with mostly rule-based parsing is that it is a bit hard to generalize the code for rare cases like this, since there are chances you \"break\" the parsing for all the other filings (ofc this does not mean a fix isn't possible)", "Hi, please see my comments below for your questions.\n1. If the financial statement can not be found in item 8/15, then it mostly like can be found after the signature part. The signature always at the end of the 10-K report, that's why I said the financial report can be found at the end  of the 10-K report. Please see below for an example.\n<img width=\"2546\" height=\"1138\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06bcdcbd-5e12-459b-bdb4-86ddb5d0c77f\" />\n2. I reviewed several reports and found that some \"INDEX TO * STATEMENTS\" sections indeed appear in item 8 or 15. Therefore, I believe it would be safer to extract the \"INDEX TO * STATEMENTS\" only if it appears after item 16. I also think this scenario is not uncommon; out of 490 tickers I downloaded, 90 fall into this case." ],

They appear slightly unbalanced on larger screens.\n\n3.Card Formatting:\nThe notes card (Mathematics I) lacks proper padding and spacing.\nThe \"Download\" link feels too close to the text above it a bit more vertical spacing would help.\n\n4.Overall Spacing and Alignment:\nThere's some inconsistency between sections, for example, between the filters and the card section.\n\n<img width=\"1915\" height=\"420\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb4d6b78-a321-4973-a37d-6cc558ffb327\" />\n\nKindly assign the issue to me @Aditya-Patwa @adityai0 , so that I can try to resolve it.",

It's been a great time saver within my workflow for some time now.\n\nI'm planning on submitting a PR for this exact feature, but I'd want to discuss a few things:\n- Should the \"namer\" only apply to i.E. zoxide items or all items? In my eyes, zoxide would benefit the most from this setting as I wouldn't want to accidentally rename any tmux or config defined sessions. Based on the decision I'd name the config field either `path_substitution` (if zoxide only) or `name_substitution` instead of `namer` (all)\n- I'd support regular expressions out of the box by trying to create a regexp based on \"find\", if it fails I'd fall back to literal substitution.\n- I'd add opt-in support for expanding env variables with `expand_env_vars = true` for portable configs (which could be useful for eg. `find = \"$HOME/.local/share/git`)\n- I'd add a `priority` field to control which substitution takes precedence (default `0`)\n\nLet me know what you thought about the feature or if you have any other recommendations/ideas \uD83D\uDE01 \n" ],

The color palette generated by Mantine is too limited if the selected color is dark or light.\n\nWe could rely on chroma-js and generate the color we need with the brighten et darken functions.\n\n- main color (or primary ?), use for the background color, should be the one defined by the user\n- secondary color (stroke) could be darken by 0.8\n- keep hiContrast and loContrast calculated as in #2100\n- generate a light and dark colors to be used when readability is affected by the theme (when there is transparency principaly)", "I'm divided between two solutions to manage light and dark colors.\n\n**1. Use two differents variables to store a light and adark value**\n\nIn this solution we check the luminance of the main color.\nIf the main color is  already pretty light\n then light = main, dark = darken(main)\nIf the main color is pretty dark\n then light = brighten(main), dark = main\n\nThis solution avoid getting a light color equal to white or a dark color equal to dark if the main color is already in the extremes.\nBut this solution implied to rely on javascript to calcultate the dark and light values instead of pure css and to use two different variables in light and dark themes. \nIt could be less maintenable.\n\n**2. Use the main color and adjust the brightness and darkness with css**\nThis solution avoid to maintain two different variables but is less accurate in the extremes color values.\nWe don't check the luminance and the main color is always brighten or darken depending of the selected theme.\n\nHere is a comparison with a light color :\nOptions 1 : Compound title and relationship from \"GraphQL\" stay light blue. There value is the same as the fill color of the element.\n\n<img width=\"1452\" height=\"541\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bdd1c18b-72c8-465e-ba20-5671da5385c2\" />\n\nOptions 2 : Compound title and relationship from \"GraphQL\" become white because they have be lighten. We lose the blue tint on those elements.\n\n<img width=\"1451\" height=\"543\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ad2329d-85b8-419e-bcdd-92f2014e384b\" />\n\nEnlarge the capture because the difference is subtil but noticeable :)\n@davydkov what do you think about it ?", "Maybe a third option that could be the best one.\n\nWe could replace \"ElementThemeColorValues\" and \"RelationshipThemeColorValues\" with just a color palette (ThemeColorValues for example).\nThen, we could use the color palette directly without specifying in the core for which usage the color will be used at the end.\nLet the \"core\" specify that this color will be used to \"fill\" or this one for \"stroke\" could be less evolutive. The idea is to let the rendering package in charge of defining this.\n\nSo, instead of : \n```\n  --colors-likec4-palette-hi-contrast: ${colors.elements.hiContrast};\n  --colors-likec4-palette-lo-contrast: ${colors.elements.loContrast};\n  --colors-likec4-palette-fill: ${colors.elements.fill};\n  --colors-likec4-palette-stroke: ${colors.elements.stroke};\n  --colors-likec4-palette-light: ${colors.elements.light};\n  --colors-likec4-palette-dark: ${colors.elements.dark};\n  --colors-likec4-relation-stroke-light: ${colors.relationships.lineColorLight};\n  --colors-likec4-relation-stroke-dark: ${colors.relationships.lineColorDark};\n  --colors-likec4-relation-stroke-selected-light: color-mix(in srgb, ${colors.relationships.lineColorLight}, var(--colors-likec4-mix-color) 20%);\n  --colors-likec4-relation-stroke-selected-dark: color-mix(in srgb, ${colors.relationships.lineColorDark}, var(--colors-likec4-mix-color) 20%);\n  --colors-likec4-relation-label: ${colors.relationships.labelColor};\n  --colors-likec4-relation-label-bg: ${colors.relationships.labelBgColor};\n```\n\nWe could have only:\n```\n  --colors-likec4-palette-primary: ${colors.primary};\n  --colors-likec4-palette-secondary: ${colors.secondary};\n  --colors-likec4-palette-hi-contrast: ${colors.hiContrast};\n  --colors-likec4-palette-lo-contrast: ${colors.loContrast};\n  --colors-likec4-palette-light: ${colors.light};\n  --colors-likec4-palette-dark: ${colors.dark};\n```\n\nAnd finally, instead of things like this :\n```\n   [edgeStroke]: '{colors.likec4.relation.stroke}',\n   [edgeStrokeSelected]: '{colors.likec4.relation.stroke.selected}',\n```\n\nWe would have :\n```\n  [edgeStroke]: {\n     _light: `{colors.likec4.palette.dark}`,\n     _dark: `{colors.likec4.palette.light}`,\n   },\n  [edgeStrokeSelected]: {\n      _light: `color-mix(in oklch, ${colors.likec4.palette.dark}, var(--colors-likec4-mix-color) 20%)`,\n      _dark: `color-mix(in oklch, ${colors.likec4.palette.light}, var(--colors-likec4-mix-color) 20%)`,\n    },\n```\n", "Tried to push a branch before my vacations just to have a preview to play with\nIt's the \"option 1\" (that was my first attempt), . \nUnfortunately I have a \"typecheck\" error that I don't understand. \n\nSee you !\n\n" ],

      "url" : "https://github.com/truffle-ai/saiki/issues/257",
      "repositoryName" : "truffle-ai/saiki",
      "description" : "## Summary\nThe application currently lacks proper cleanup handlers for graceful shutdown. When users interrupt the process (Ctrl+C) or when unexpected exits occur, resources like database connections, file handles, and active sessions may not be properly cleaned up.\n\n## Current Problem\n```typescript\n// No cleanup handlers - resources may leak on unexpected exit\nprocess.on('SIGINT', () => {\n    process.exit(0); // Immediate exit without cleanup\n});\n```\n\nThis can lead to:\n- Unclosed database connections\n- Temporary files not being cleaned up\n- Active agent sessions not being properly stopped\n- WebSocket connections left hanging\n- Potential data corruption in edge cases\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n### 1. Create cleanup manager in `src/core/lifecycle/cleanup.ts`:\n```typescript\nexport class CleanupManager {\n    private cleanupTasks: Array<() => Promise<void>> = [];\n    private isShuttingDown = false;\n\n    addCleanupTask(task: () => Promise<void>): void {\n        if (this.isShuttingDown) {\n            throw new Error('Cannot add cleanup tasks during shutdown');\n        }\n        this.cleanupTasks.push(task);\n    }\n\n    removeCleanupTask(task: () => Promise<void>): void {\n        const index = this.cleanupTasks.indexOf(task);\n        if (index > -1) {\n            this.cleanupTasks.splice(index, 1);\n        }\n    }\n\n    async executeCleanup(): Promise<void> {\n        if (this.isShuttingDown) return;\n        \n        this.isShuttingDown = true;\n        logger.info('Starting graceful shutdown...');\n\n        const cleanupPromises = this.cleanupTasks.map(async (task, index) => {\n            try {\n                await Promise.race([\n                    task(),\n                    new Promise((_, reject) => \n                        setTimeout(() => reject(new Error('Cleanup timeout')), 5000)\n                    )\n                ]);\n                logger.debug(`Cleanup task ${index + 1} completed`);\n            } catch (error) {\n                logger.error(`Cleanup task ${index + 1} failed:`, error);\n            }\n        });\n\n        await Promise.allSettled(cleanupPromises);\n        logger.info('Graceful shutdown completed');\n    }\n}\n\nexport const cleanupManager = new CleanupManager();\n```\n\n### 2. Add shutdown handlers in `src/core/lifecycle/shutdown.ts`:\n```typescript\nimport { cleanupManager } from './cleanup.js';\nimport { logger } from '../logger/index.js';\n\nexport function registerShutdownHandlers(): void {\n    const signals: NodeJS.Signals[] = ['SIGINT', 'SIGTERM', 'SIGUSR2'];\n    \n    signals.forEach(signal => {\n        process.on(signal, async () => {\n            logger.info(`Received ${signal}, initiating graceful shutdown...`);\n            \n            try {\n                await cleanupManager.executeCleanup();\n                process.exit(0);\n            } catch (error) {\n                logger.error('Error during cleanup:', error);\n                process.exit(1);\n            }\n        });\n    });\n\n    process.on('uncaughtException', async (error) => {\n        logger.error('Uncaught exception:', error);\n        try {\n            await cleanupManager.executeCleanup();\n        } catch (cleanupError) {\n            logger.error('Error during emergency cleanup:', cleanupError);\n        }\n        process.exit(1);\n    });\n\n    process.on('unhandledRejection', async (reason) => {\n        logger.error('Unhandled rejection:', reason);\n        try {\n            await cleanupManager.executeCleanup();\n        } catch (cleanupError) {\n            logger.error('Error during emergency cleanup:', cleanupError);\n        }\n        process.exit(1);\n    });\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Update SaikiAgent to register cleanup tasks:\n```typescript\nexport class SaikiAgent {\n    async start(): Promise<void> {\n        // ... existing start logic\n        \n        // Register cleanup tasks\n        cleanupManager.addCleanupTask(async () => {\n            logger.info('Stopping SaikiAgent...');\n            await this.stop();\n        });\n\n        cleanupManager.addCleanupTask(async () => {\n            logger.info('Closing database connections...');\n            await this.storage.close();\n        });\n    }\n\n    async stop(): Promise<void> {\n        // ... existing stop logic\n        \n        // Remove cleanup tasks since we're manually stopping\n        cleanupManager.removeCleanupTask(this.stopCleanupTask);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Update CLI to register shutdown handlers:\n```typescript\n// src/app/cli/cli.ts\nimport { registerShutdownHandlers } from '../../core/lifecycle/shutdown.js';\n\nexport async function startCLI(): Promise<void> {\n    registerShutdownHandlers();\n    \n    // ... existing CLI logic\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Update server mode to register cleanup:\n```typescript\n// src/app/api/server.ts\nimport { cleanupManager } from '../../core/lifecycle/cleanup.js';\n\nexport async function startServer(): Promise<void> {\n    const server = app.listen(port);\n    \n    cleanupManager.addCleanupTask(async () => {\n        logger.info('Closing HTTP server...');\n        return new Promise((resolve) => {\n            server.close(() => resolve());\n        });\n    });\n}\n```\n\n## Benefits\n1. **Resource Safety**: Prevents resource leaks on unexpected exits\n2. **Data Integrity**: Ensures proper cleanup of temporary files and database transactions\n3. **Better User Experience**: Clean shutdown messages and proper exit codes\n4. **Production Ready**: Essential for server deployments and long-running processes\n\n## Implementation Steps\n1. Create cleanup manager and shutdown handler utilities\n2. Update SaikiAgent to register cleanup tasks\n3. Update CLI to use shutdown handlers\n4. Update server mode to register HTTP server cleanup\n5. Add tests for cleanup scenarios\n6. Update documentation with graceful shutdown behavior\n\n## Files to Create/Update\n- `src/core/lifecycle/cleanup.ts` (new)\n- `src/core/lifecycle/shutdown.ts` (new)\n- `src/core/ai/agent/SaikiAgent.ts`\n- `src/app/cli/cli.ts`\n- `src/app/api/server.ts`\n- `src/app/index.ts`\n- Add tests in `src/core/lifecycle/cleanup.test.ts`\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Cleanup manager handles multiple cleanup tasks with timeout\n- [ ] Shutdown handlers registered for SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGUSR2\n- [ ] SaikiAgent registers proper cleanup tasks\n- [ ] CLI and server modes use graceful shutdown\n- [ ] Uncaught exceptions and unhandled rejections trigger cleanup\n- [ ] Tests verify cleanup behavior\n- [ ] No breaking changes to existing functionality\n- [ ] Documentation updated with shutdown behavior\n\n## Testing Strategy\n```typescript\ndescribe('CleanupManager', () => {\n    it('should execute all cleanup tasks on shutdown', async () => {\n        const cleanupSpy1 = vi.fn().mockResolvedValue(undefined);\n        const cleanupSpy2 = vi.fn().mockResolvedValue(undefined);\n        \n        cleanupManager.addCleanupTask(cleanupSpy1);\n        cleanupManager.addCleanupTask(cleanupSpy2);\n        \n        await cleanupManager.executeCleanup();\n        \n        expect(cleanupSpy1).toHaveBeenCalled();\n        expect(cleanupSpy2).toHaveBeenCalled();\n    });\n\n    it('should handle cleanup task failures gracefully', async () => {\n        const failingTask = vi.fn().mockRejectedValue(new Error('Cleanup failed'));\n        const successTask = vi.fn().mockResolvedValue(undefined);\n        \n        cleanupManager.addCleanupTask(failingTask);\n        cleanupManager.addCleanupTask(successTask);\n        \n        await cleanupManager.executeCleanup();\n        \n        expect(failingTask).toHaveBeenCalled();\n        expect(successTask).toHaveBeenCalled();\n    });\n});\n```\n\n## Estimated Effort\n**2-4 hours** - Good for developers learning about Node.js lifecycle management and graceful shutdown patterns.\n\n## Learning Opportunities\n- Node.js process signals and event handling\n- Resource management and cleanup patterns\n- Async/await error handling\n- Testing shutdown scenarios\n- Production deployment best practices",

      "repositoryName" : "truffle-ai/saiki",
      "description" : "## Summary\nCurrently, the codebase uses a mix of generic `Error` objects and custom error types, which makes error handling inconsistent and harder to debug. We should standardize error handling with proper custom error classes.\n\n## Current Problem\n```typescript\n// Mix of error types across the codebase\nthrow new Error(`Provider '${provider}' not found`); // Generic Error\nthrow new CantInferProviderError(model); // Custom error\nthrow new Error(`Model '${model}' not found in provider '${provider}'`); // Generic Error\n```\n\n## Proposed Solution\nCreate standardized custom error classes for common error scenarios:\n\n### 1. Create error classes in `src/core/errors/index.ts`:\n```typescript\nexport class UnknownProviderError extends Error {\n    constructor(provider: string, availableProviders?: string[]) {\n        const message = availableProviders \n            ? `Provider '${provider}' not found. Available providers: ${availableProviders.join(', ')}`\n            : `Provider '${provider}' not found`;\n        super(message);\n        this.name = 'UnknownProviderError';\n    }\n}\n\nexport class UnknownModelError extends Error {\n    constructor(provider: string, model: string, availableModels?: string[]) {\n        const message = availableModels\n            ? `Model '${model}' not found in provider '${provider}'. Available models: ${availableModels.join(', ')}`\n            : `Model '${model}' not found in provider '${provider}'`;\n        super(message);\n        this.name = 'UnknownModelError';\n    }\n}\n\nexport class ValidationError extends Error {\n    constructor(message: string, public readonly field?: string) {\n        super(message);\n        this.name = 'ValidationError';\n    }\n}\n\nexport class ConfigurationError extends Error {\n    constructor(message: string, public readonly configPath?: string) {\n        super(message);\n        this.name = 'ConfigurationError';\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Update registry.ts to use custom errors:\n```typescript\nimport { UnknownProviderError, UnknownModelError } from '../errors/index.js';\n\nexport function getSupportedFileTypesForModel(provider: string, model: string): SupportedFileType[] {\n    const providerInfo = LLM_REGISTRY[provider as LLMProvider];\n    if (\\!providerInfo) {\n        throw new UnknownProviderError(provider, Object.keys(LLM_REGISTRY));\n    }\n\n    if (acceptsAnyModel(provider)) {\n        return [];\n    }\n\n    const modelInfo = providerInfo.models.find((m) => m.name.toLowerCase() === model.toLowerCase());\n    if (\\!modelInfo) {\n        const availableModels = providerInfo.models.map(m => m.name);\n        throw new UnknownModelError(provider, model, availableModels);\n    }\n\n    return modelInfo.supportedFileTypes;\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Update other files to use standardized errors:\n- `src/core/config/loader.ts` - Use `ConfigurationError`\n- `src/core/ai/llm/validation.ts` - Use `ValidationError`\n- `src/app/cli/` files - Catch and handle specific error types\n\n## Benefits\n1. **Better Debugging**: Specific error types make it easier to identify issues\n2. **Improved User Experience**: More helpful error messages with context\n3. **Easier Testing**: Can test for specific error types instead of string matching\n4. **Type Safety**: TypeScript can help catch error handling issues\n\n## Implementation Steps\n1. Create `src/core/errors/index.ts` with standard error classes\n2. Update `src/core/ai/llm/registry.ts` to use custom errors\n3. Update other files that throw generic errors\n4. Add tests for error scenarios\n5. Update error handling in CLI to provide user-friendly messages\n\n## Files to Update\n- `src/core/ai/llm/registry.ts`\n- `src/core/config/loader.ts` \n- `src/core/ai/llm/validation.ts`\n- `src/app/cli/cli.ts`\n- Add tests in respective `.test.ts` files\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] All custom error classes created with proper inheritance\n- [ ] Registry functions use specific error types\n- [ ] Error messages include helpful context (available options)\n- [ ] Tests updated to check for specific error types\n- [ ] CLI provides user-friendly error messages\n- [ ] No breaking changes to existing error handling\n\n## Estimated Effort\n**2-3 hours** - Good for developers familiar with TypeScript error handling patterns.\n\n## Learning Opportunities\n- TypeScript error handling best practices\n- Custom error class design\n- Error message UX design\n- Testing error scenarios",

Very weird.\n\nI think it depends on how you are running the `airflow` command and whether the container you are running it in has the FAB provider installed and FAB Auth manager configured. Can you check it ?\n", "First of all, and as always thank you so much for Apache Airflow :), I've depended on it for years for many projects.\n\nAnd yes, as far as I can tell we do have it installed. Some \"evidence\" that may help, short of showing the running system.\n\n1. I'm using a custom docker image (but based on apache/airflow:3.0.0-python3.12) that includes this in its requirements: **apache-airflow-providers-fab==2.0.1**. This is a gist with its definition and related files: https://gist.github.com/mrbungie/ab8e2a2104e56c7d6dc8872d01d44f9a\n2. I'm setting the following relevant values in my helm chart: https://gist.github.com/mrbungie/eaae9aed11d04b04d960376788d3e91e (here im showing it with webserver.defaultUser = false, but when I set it to true, the createUser fails)\n3. We implemented a webserver_config.py (shown in [1] gist integrated with EntraID). And it works, so FAB is working.\n\nWhen I get into most containers, they do have the users subcommand:\n<img width=\"1260\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee48e1aa-ec4a-49be-be7c-37fa666eddfa\" />\n\nBut when checking the create-user container (after setting createUser to true), it fails.\n\n<img width=\"727\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a486456-24c5-4d5e-a2b9-e918ea0416e3\" />\n<img width=\"1271\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79d1a1f3-dd36-44a3-9306-f9dd40cab6ed\" />\n\nI'm pretty sure it has to do with the fact that the env vars overriding Auth are not reaching the createUser container.\ncreate-user envvars:\n\n<img width=\"730\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abb8def2-b78c-464c-9ecd-f0317f421901\" />\n\nMeanwhile other containers (like api-server)\n\n<img width=\"731\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea1437bb-c9c1-470c-9df1-f5f74ba42b6a\" />\n\nI guess that means that that setting (i.e. airflow.core.auth_manager / AIRFLOW__CORE__AUTH_MANAGER) **should be set exclusively via airflow.cfg**, but I think docs should be clearer about that.\n\nIf that's not the hoped behaviour, I would guess AIRFLOW__CORE__AUTH_MANAGER, if set, should be propagated down into the create-user container (after all, if its going to run create-user in Airflow 3, it should have that set to FAB or it is always going to fail). Maybe the create-user container should check if FAB is on (via env var + airflow.cfg), and if not, it should just continue gracefully and maybe logging that so users are advised to set createUser = false if they are just using Simple Auth. \n\nIf anything I'm saying makes sense, I can make a PR fixing this in some direction you propose.\n\nMore info:\nHelm chart commit SHA256: https://github.com/apache/airflow/commit/3bd9746d5c30d47fec1e50cc95a3b83add1ee3e8\n \n<img width=\"1460\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24d3c3b4-bbbe-4b24-8d50-d2bc194cbaa2\" />", "OK. So it means that createUserJob template needs to be fixed. I marked it for next chart version and as good first issue.

Thanks for all those invstigations @mrbungie ! and Fix would be really nice!", "From version>=3.0.0, no subcommand 'users'.\n\nYou would have to use airflow standalone, which also gets an error", "@mrbungie may I ask how you added the `AIRFLOW__CORE__AUTH_MANAGER` env variable?

I've mainly been focusing my efforts in [generator.go](https://github.com/a-h/templ/blob/main/generator/generator.go) around indent levels. From the code example provided, it looks like the style tag is not indenting child nodes as we expect, and its closing tag.\n\nKnowing that, I _think_ the issue is inside either [writeTemplBuffer](https://github.com/a-h/templ/blob/main/generator/generator.go#L376), [writeTemplate](https://github.com/a-h/templ/blob/main/generator/generator.go#L428), or [writeNode](https://github.com/a-h/templ/blob/main/generator/generator.go#L587).\n\nI will keep poking around for now but could probably use some confirmation I'm at least looking in the right area.\n\nAnd just so we're on the same page, this is what the expected result should be, right?\n```templ\ntempl leftRight(left templ.Component, right templ.Component) {\n    <style>\n        body {\n            background: black;\n        }\n    </style>\n    <div class=\"flex flex-col items-center justify-center h-screen\">\n        <div></div>\n        <div class=\"flex flex-row\">\n            @left\n            @right\n        </div> \n        <div>\n            Se priser\n        </div>\n    </div>\n}\n```", "I think this does the same thing with `<script>` tags - mainly the closing `</script>` tags.", "So, you've probably figured out that `templ fmt` formats templ files by parsing a template file into an object model, then writing it back out again.\n\nYou can see that in action here: https://github.com/a-h/templ/blob/850120161a0434ee73b92810f02e4def8a70c850/cmd/templ/fmtcmd/main.go#L141-L166\n\nNote that the `TemplateFile.Write` method writes the object model out: https://github.com/a-h/templ/blob/850120161a0434ee73b92810f02e4def8a70c850/parser/v2/types.go#L128-L150\n\nSo you can see that each `Node` gets written out in turn.\n\nThe script and style elements are parsed into the following types: https://github.com/a-h/templ/blob/850120161a0434ee73b92810f02e4def8a70c850/parser/v2/types.go#L669-L703\n\nBy this parsing code: https://github.com/a-h/templ/blob/850120161a0434ee73b92810f02e4def8a70c850/parser/v2/raw.go\n\nI can see that the style and script tags don't populate out a `TrailingSpace`, like the other elements do: https://github.com/a-h/templ/blob/850120161a0434ee73b92810f02e4def8a70c850/parser/v2/elementparser.go#L496 \n\nI think ths issue is probably:\n\n  - Not parsing trailing whitespace into the object model, so it can't be retained properly.\n  - Not writing out appropriate indentation in the `Write` method to ensure that the `</script>` / `</style>` element is properly indented.\n\nNote that there's some formatting tests alonside the `templ fmt` command, so that's a good place to add test cases.\n\nHope that helps you track it down!" ],

With over 5 years of experience in frontend development, I???ve worked on similar projects and can ensure a clean, user-friendly, and well-structured implementation.\n\n## Steps to Resolve:\n\n<details>\n  <summary><strong>1) Locate the Dashboard View</strong></summary>\n  <br>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Find the main dashboard component in the codebase (likely in /app or /components).</li>\n    <li>Identify the best place in the UI to include the new button, considering design and usability.</li>\n  </ul>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary><strong>2) Add the Button to Navigate to Analytics</strong></summary>\n  <br>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Create a button labeled \"Analytics\".</li>\n    <li>Ensure it uses proper styling consistent with the rest of the app (e.g., using TailwindCSS or ShadCN components).</li>\n    <li>Link the button to redirect the user to `/app/analytics` or the correct route defined for analytics.</li>\n  </ul>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary><strong>3) Ensure Proper Navigation and UX</strong></summary>\n  <br>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Use Next.js `<Link>` component or programmatic routing with `useRouter` to handle the navigation properly.</li>\n    <li>Optionally include an icon (e.g., chart icon) to reinforce visual meaning.</li>\n  </ul>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary><strong>4) Test Responsiveness and Layout</strong></summary>\n  <br>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Ensure that the button appears correctly on all screen sizes.</li>\n    <li>Validate spacing and positioning with the rest of the dashboard components.</li>\n  </ul>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary><strong>5) Commit and Create a PR</strong></summary>\n  <br>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Push changes to a feature branch.</li>\n    <li>Open a pull request with a clear description, screenshots, and checklist.</li>\n  </ul>\n</details>\n\n---\n\n**Estimated Time:** Less than 1 day\n\n## Why I???m interested:\n\nI have a strong background in frontend development with React and Next.js, and I specialize in UI/UX consistency, component architecture, and accessibility. I???ve worked with dashboards before, and I know how crucial it is to ensure intuitive navigation and a clean UI/UX.\n\n## References:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50fcce52-e850-4bd2-8e58-b28cb1b9f17a)\n\nI am a rising contributor; other projects have already given me the opportunity to participate, and the final results have left the maintainers satisfied. So, I have work references, and they will continue to grow as long as you allow me to participate and contribute to making your dream a reality, which is an honor for me.\n\n[BabyBeastsv2](https://github.com/ByteBuildersLabs/BabyBeastsv2/pull/71)  \n[Lyricsflip](https://github.com/songifi/lyricsflip/pull/93)  \n[Revolutionary Farmers](https://github.com/Crypto-Jaguars/Revo-Marketplace/pull/43)  \n[SafeTrust](https://github.com/safetrustcr/dApp-SafeTrust/pull/30)  \n[Starklotto](https://starklotto.vercel.app/)  \n[StarShop](https://github.com/StarShopCr/StarShop-Frontend/pull/36)  \n[Timelycapsule](https://github.com/enbliq/timelycapsule-web/pull/52)  \n[VolunChain](https://github.com/VolunChain/VolunChain-Frontend/pull/23)\n\n## Social Link:\nTelegram: [drakkomaximo](https://t.me/drakkomaximo)\n\nLet me know if I can start working on this!\n", "Hi!

This would be consistent with how the Linux `cp` works.\n```\n% cp 0.json tmp/\ncp: directory tmp does not exist\n```\n\nInstead, this command creates a file called mydir with the contents of hello.txt.\n\nAnother option is to transparently create mydir. The Files API has the behaviour that it is supposed to create directories that don???t exist when uploading a file. \n\nThe cp should differentiate between whether the target is a file or a directory based on the trailing slash.\n\n### Is this a regression?\nNo",

The actions-user bot will reset the file back to previous state for the next contributor after your commit is merged. So you can just simply start working with the issue right away!*\r\n\r\n### How to get started\r\n\r\nNavigate to the `tasks/matlab/easy` directory from the root of your project.\r\nThen open a file called `addition.m` and start implementing your solution!\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nMATLAB is primarily used as a desktop application, and VS Code doesn't run MATLAB directly. However, you can use VS Code as an editor for MATLAB scripts. Issue for this task is to create a simple MATLAB script that adds two numbers and prints the result.\r\n\r\n### How to run\r\n\r\nTo test the program you have to first make sure you are in the right directory:\r\n```bash\r\ncd tasks/matlab/easy\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun the program with the command:\r\n```bash\r\nmatlab -r addition.m\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the program works as requested in the task, you are ready to make a pull request!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo work with this issue, you need to have MATLAB installed to your local machine.\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions of installing MATLAB and how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

I noticed the memory usage and time performance are especially sensitive to the `sidemax` parameter. Right now we use a default of 100nm. There should be no reason to ever use a `sidemax` value larger than the volume you're packing.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nIf `sidemax` isn't specified by the user, the default behavior should be to calculate it from the box used for the packing method.\n\n",

Appending a works, but appending b fails even though:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nIn [4]: len('???')\r\nOut[4]: 1\r\n```\r\nSo far I simply used str.len().max() on the string columns to the the numbers for min_itemsize, but this does not work in the example here. This MWE is of course simplified, but I guess I'm wondering:\r\n\r\n- how does pytables come up with the string length?\r\n- how should I determine the string length? Considering the encoding is unknown, but pytables assumes some encoding / pytables converts the strings to some other object?\r\n\r\nIn this toy example I could encode the string as utf-8 to get the correct length, but this isn't a general approach:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nIn [5]: len('???'.encode('utf-8'))\r\nOut[5]: 3\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### MWE:\r\n```python\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n                                                      \r\na = pd.DataFrame([['a', 'b']], columns = ['A', 'B'])\r\nb = pd.DataFrame([['???', 'b']], columns = ['A', 'B'])\r\n\r\nstore = pd.HDFStore('/tmp/tmpstore')\r\n\r\nstore.append('df', a, min_itemsizes={'A': 1, 'B': 1})\r\nstore.append('df', b, min_itemsizes={'A': 1, 'B': 1}) # fails\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Expected Output\r\nValueError: Trying to store a string with len [3] in [values_block_0] column but\r\nthis column has a limit of [1]!\r\nConsider using min_itemsize to preset the sizes on these columns\r\nClosing remaining open files:/tmp/tmpstore...done\r\n\r\n#### Output of ``pd.show_versions()``\r\n\r\n<details>INSTALLED VERSIONS\r\n------------------\r\ncommit: None\r\npython: 3.5.2.final.0\r\npython-bits: 64\r\nOS: Linux\r\nOS-release: 4.4.28-2-MANJARO\r\nmachine: x86_64\r\nprocessor: \r\nbyteorder: little\r\nLC_ALL: en_US.UTF-8\r\nLANG: en_DE.UTF-8\r\nLOCALE: en_US.UTF-8\r\n\r\npandas: 0.19.0\r\nnose: 1.3.7\r\npip: 8.1.2\r\nsetuptools: 27.2.0\r\nCython: 0.23.5\r\nnumpy: 1.11.2\r\nscipy: 0.18.1\r\nstatsmodels: None\r\nxarray: None\r\nIPython: 5.1.0\r\nsphinx: 1.4.8\r\npatsy: None\r\ndateutil: 2.5.3\r\npytz: 2016.7\r\nblosc: None\r\nbottleneck: None\r\ntables: 3.3.0\r\nnumexpr: 2.6.1\r\nmatplotlib: 1.5.3\r\nopenpyxl: None\r\nxlrd: None\r\nxlwt: None\r\nxlsxwriter: None\r\nlxml: None\r\nbs4: None\r\nhtml5lib: None\r\nhttplib2: None\r\napiclient: None\r\nsqlalchemy: 1.1.3\r\npymysql: None\r\npsycopg2: 2.6.2 (dt dec pq3 ext lo64)\r\njinja2: 2.8\r\nboto: None\r\npandas_datareader: None\r\n</details>\r\n",

This extra step can be error-prone and may lead to duplicate operator installations.\n\n### Objective\n\nAutomate the detection of any existing `kubeflex` deployment and adjust the installation behavior accordingly. This reduces manual configuration, avoids unnecessary errors, and provides a more seamless experience.\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\n- **Helm Logic Enhancement:**  \n  Implement a helper in `helpers.tpl` that uses the Helm `lookup` function to check for an existing `kubeflex` deployment in all namespaces.\n    - If present, set `kubeflex-operator.install` to `false` by default.\n    - If absent, allow it to install as usual.\n\n- **Dynamic Value Handling:**  \n  Use this auto-detection logic as the new default, while still allowing users to override the value directly.\n\n- **Documentation:**  \n  Update the README and chart documentation to clarify this behavior (auto-detection, manual override, limitations).\n\n- **Testing:**  \n  Add or update test cases to ensure:\n    - No existing deployment ??? operator is installed.\n    - Existing deployment ??? operator is not installed.\n    - User override is always respected.\n\n- **Limitations:**  \n  Document:\n    - Helm 3+ requirement.\n    - RBAC permissions necessary for the `lookup` function to work.\n    - Need for cluster reachability at install/upgrade time.\n\n### Request\n\nIf no one is currently assigned, I would be happy to take ownership of this enhancement. Please let me know if there are any specific considerations, or if you have feedback or preferences regarding the solution or implementation strategy.\n\nThank you for considering my proposal???I look forward to contributing!", "thanks @Akshitha2106 , submit an PR!", "@Akshitha2106 you can work on this issue, I'll take the other one, but if you need any help, feel free to reach out to me !", "@Akshitha2106 are you still working on this issue?", "If not, I can take it up.", "> If not, I can take it up.\n\nOk!", "@Rupam-It @francostellari \nWe can't use dynamic template rendering in `values.yaml` file for settting up `kubeflex-operator.install` value. Also, we can't use named templates in `Charts.yaml`  for controlling the dependency condition dynamically because this file is evaluated earlier before the templates are renderred.\n\nPre-create Hooks aren't also useful for controlling kubeflex-operator deployment because at that time HELM will already know what to deploy in the cluster. \n\nSo, I have an idea of changing the `kubflex-operator` HELM chart by introducing a new Boolean variable called `autoDetect`. Initially, we will set this variable to `false`. We will define a named template `kubeflex-operator.shouldInstall` . If `autoDetect` is set to `false` [ This is the default value for kubeflex-operator ] then the `kubeflex-operator.shouldInstall` will return `true` and if  `autoDetect` is set to `true`  [ This value will be passed by the `Kubestellar-core` Helm chart ], then we will perform `lookup` and the named template will return true/false based on the availability of `kubeflex-operator` components in the cluster.\n\nWe will wrap all the resource templates with if condition using `kubeflex-operator.shouldInstall` named template. This will not affect any previous behaviour of Kubeflex because:\n\n- For standalone kubeflex-operator installation: The default `autoDetect: false` ensures the chart behaves exactly as it does now, with no surprises.\n- And, For kubestellar Helm chart installation: The parent chart simply overrides the `autoDetect` to `true`, activating the kubeflex-operator autoDetection logic.\n\nAnd, I think this approach will help to achieve the automation we wanted in the kubestellar core HELM chart without breaking the default behavior of kubeflex chart.\n\nWhat are your thoughts regarding this ? If OK, I can start implementing. Thanks", "@greninja517 I don't like the idea of modifying the KubeFlex chart as you suggested.\nThis is not an issue that relates to the KubeFlex chart.\nIt's only a problem for KubeStellar core-charts that want to use an existing KubeFlex.\n\n1. can we investigate with the Helm community if there is a know solution to the problem of deciding to install/or-not a dependent chart at the moment the template is rendered based on cluster resources?\n2. an alternative solution, which however adds other complications, would be to move the kflex install from a dependent chart into a helm-job container that is controller by the `lookup` function", "I have tried to seek help form Helm user channel: https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C0NH30761/p1753451642902949", "I don't think using a Job to install the dependent `kubeflex` chart is ideal. This way `KubeStellar` release will be unaware about `kubeflex`. \nLet's see if we can find any solution from the community." ],

Browse a table (or other pages)\r\n2. Execute this script in the developer tools, should return an empty array (no duplicate ids)\r\n```js\r\nObject.values(\r\n    Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('[id]'))\r\n        .reduce(\r\n            (all, n) => {\r\n                if (!(n.id in all)) {\r\n                    all[n.id] = [];\r\n                }\r\n                all[n.id].push(n);\r\n                return all;\r\n            }, \r\n            {}\r\n        )\r\n).filter((l) => l.length > 1);\r\n```\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nAll ids should be used only once per page, if a selector has to match multiple elements, use classes instead.\r\n\r\n### Server configuration\r\n\r\n- phpMyAdmin version: 5.2 / 6\r\n\r\n### Client configuration\r\n\r\n- Browser: Chrome\r\n- Operating system: Windows 10",

Strings can also optionally contain context.\n- If I want to fix one translation issue, I don't have to fork the whole repo and submit a pull request, I can just go on Crowdin/Weblate and change that string\n- Dictionary (You have to open it for everyone or have a proofreader).

TLDR: it's just much nicer to work with for a translator, and as a developer you can track the progress of each language.\n\nBut that's for Crowdin, I haven't worked much with Weblate. I know that Weblate is open source, while Crowdin is not and mainly commercial, but offers a generous free plan for open source projects. If I had to choose, I would choose Crowdin because UI and workflow is much nicer.\n\nFrom the \"downsides\", translations have to be in separate files with some supported format.

It's weird, I don't think it's supposed to work like that. The same behavior is observed when using `(left=*, top=*, width=* height=*)` or `(left_top=*, width_height=*)`.\n\nUpdate (as of this writing): The Rect is clearly created when I use print to check, but all of its information is reset. `print(button)` returns `Rect(0, 0, 0, 0)`.\n\nI have no idea if other pygame functions have the same behavior.

IMHO, however, it may be impractical, as there really is no 'standard' syntax definition file which is widely accepted. Although *'.tmLanguage'* files can be read by several code editors - and its specifications implemented to a certain degree - there are usually caveats and restrictions. Most of these software packages have their own, native syntax file formats, which is really what needs to be used when we want to take full advantage of all the features our chosen editor has to offer.\r\n\r\nFor instance: with version 3 of Sublime Text, we now have *['.sublime-syntax'](http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/syntax.html)* files, which are much easier to implement, specially for languages where we may have multiple embedded contexts, like Pug. Indeed, the current developer of the Sublime Text \".tmLanguage\" file for Pug [seems to have abandoned the project](https://github.com/davidrios/pug-tmbundle/issues/10), as \".tmLanguage\" files are not easy to edit and maintain, and require a form of compilation/transpilation for use with the new Sublime.\r\n\r\nAlso, for most code editors, users can download 'language packs', which include not only a syntax definition, but also other language specific goodies, such as snippets and code-completion enablers. These often require multiple files, developed and packaged alongside the syntax definition. \r\n\r\nThis probably explains why, in the majority of cases, language support for different code editors ends up being either the work of the **code editor developer** - if it's a popular and often-requested language - or by some well-meaning volunteers, which often work in consultation with the language spec developers.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the 3 most popular code editors around seem to be Sublime Text, VS Code, and Atom. So, perhaps what we need is 3 code editor \"Pros\", who are already savvy with developing syntax files and language packages for their favourite editor, and who can setup 3 (semi-)official repositories for Pug language support for their editors - with support from the Pug team, which could make themselves available if any consultation is required.", "If someone wants to contribute and maintain an \"official\" language file for pug, I'd be happy to have it live in a folder in this repository, but it's not something I personally have time to create/maintain.

I had a question and would appreciate your input on this.\n\nYou mentioned wanting a UI filter to show only DAGs with import errors (`has_import_errors = true`). That makes sense, and I actually opened [this issue](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/53536) to implement the change on the API side as well.\n\nHowever, after digging into it, I realized there???s a complication: even though the `Dags` table has a `has_import_errors` field (which is `false` when there are no errors), if a DAG *does* have an import error, it never gets an entry in the `Dags` table at all. I tested this by creating a DAG with an import error:\n\n```python\nfrom airflow import DAG\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n# This will break the import!\nthis_will_throw_an_error\n\ndefault_args = {\n    'start_date': datetime(2023, 1, 1),\n}\n\ndag = DAG(\n    'broken_dag',\n    default_args=default_args,\n    schedule_interval=None,\n)\n```\n\nAs expected, the database only has my older (valid) DAG, but not the new one with the import error. \n\n<img width=\"900\" height=\"191\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f11d5c7-a8ae-4f09-9885-ce1ec59d9aa5\" />\n\nThe broken DAG does show up in the Airflow UI (in the \"Import Errors\" section), but there???s no entry for it in the Dags table in the DB. \n\n<img width=\"124\" height=\"83\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2115d883-d3d7-4d02-8951-129f3cc6b683\" />\n\n<img width=\"848\" height=\"208\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd59ed07-692d-40a5-b515-97c75ddf0499\" />\n\n<img width=\"946\" height=\"421\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bafd60c2-79f3-47e8-a431-ec44dc97ec80\" />\n\nThis seems to be because there???s a separate `import_error` table handling these cases. I???ve also confirmed this with @rawwar .\n\n<img width=\"858\" height=\"539\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0ba340a-f848-49bd-9f2a-a27a00dccf8f\" />\n\nGiven this setup, it seems like adding an API/UI filter on `has_import_errors` wouldn???t actually be useful, since the broken DAGs aren???t in the `Dags` table to be filtered in the first place, they???re already shown separately in the UI.\n\nCould you please advise whether we should still go ahead with this filter, or if it makes more sense to close the issue I opened yesterday as \"not planned\"? I can start looking into other filters in the meantime. Would appreciate a quick response, thanks!\n", "Yes maybe just disregard that field for now and focus on other filters.\n\nIt???s weird I wasn???t able to identify where that Dag attribute was set. I???ll need to do more digging. ", "Thanks @AryanK1511 - sorry for the delay. Agree that that's weird. If you come across more that don't work or can't get to any, just comment on the issue and move on. All and any progress is helpful, happy to create other issues if we need to for tracking purposes.\n\nThanks again for taking this on! ", "Thank you so much for your help guys. I will start working on the other stuff now.", "I???ve created the following issues for the API changes. Once I???ve completed them, I???ll add the UI filters all at once.\n\n- #53738\n- #53739\n- #53740\n- #53741\n\nCould someone please assign these issues to me?", "Assigned!" ],

You're running _Linux_ inside _Windows_, so the only reasonable options to display here, in my opinion, is either of those (instead of \"WSL\" / \"Docker\", ...).\n\nBut since you're not the first person bringing this up and since it's a small and not very much impactful change, I'll add it as change request nevertheless.", "Sure, here is some surveys\n\n[Stackoverflow 2024](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology#1-operating-system)\n[Stackoverflow 2023](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#section-most-popular-technologies-operating-system)\n\nI also regenerated my summaries today (before your message) and older Linux data became WSL. but new datas are considered as Linux again.\nI tried regenerate again but there is no change.\n\n<img width=\"739\" height=\"326\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/431e6851-3bbc-4e27-9390-97f8ed144b9b\" />\n\nAlso a lot of \"unknown\" labeled data instead of \"coding\" but clearly they are came from VsCode extension and has coding related info such as branch or etc whilte category field is empty. But it is not related with WSL.", "Hm maybe WSL showed in above picture because I clicked import data in integration tab for wakatime. I will check again after my 24 hour waiting time complete\n\nEdit: Yes above WSL data comes from Wakatime Integration. When I click import data and regenerate data form danger zone, it syncs like that.\n\nSo there is no Wakapi support for WSL but it reads Wakatime WSL data as WSL as well instead of changing to Linux." ],

Frontend:\n- Build a new page `/admin/announcements` using **Shadcn UI** and **Tailwind CSS**\n- Allow admins to:\n  - Add/edit/delete announcements via form\n  - Trigger fetch from NewsAPI and display preview\n- Add proper **form validation**, **toast notifications**, and **loading states**\n- Ensure responsiveness and route protection for `/admin/*`\n\n#### ??? Backend:\n- Create the following API routes:\n  - `POST /admin/announcement` ??? to add/edit announcements\n  - `GET /admin/news-feed` ??? fetch from NewsAPI, apply filtering, and return results\n- Use Supabase or your preferred DB service for storing custom announcements\n- Integrate NewsAPI securely using `.env` variables\n- Ensure only authenticated admin users can access these endpoints\n\n### \uD83D\uDD0D Testing Plan:\n- Local testing for all flows (add/edit announcement, fetch tech feed)\n- Secure admin-only access via JWT/auth checks\n- Clean UI, no console errors, and tested with dummy data\n\nLooking forward to contributing to DevElevate \uD83D\uDE80  \nLet me know if you'd like a UI mock or route flow preview before I begin.\n\nThanks!\n???

Navigate to the event cards section.\n3.

      "url" : "https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/issues/20553",
      "repositoryName" : "openvinotoolkit/openvino",
      "description" : "### Context\r\n\r\nNeural networks are graphs consisting of nodes called operators. Each operator corresponds to a mathematical function, usually described in framework's documentation or an AI standard, such as ONNX.\r\nOpenVINO ONNX Frontend is a component responsible for working with ONNX graphs and requires implementation of different ONNX operators in order to use ONNX models.\r\nThis task requires alignment between OpenVINO ONNX Frontend and original framework implementations of AveragePool for next list of opsets: [opset 7](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/main/docs/Changelog.md#AveragePool-7),  [opset 10](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/main/docs/Changelog.md#AveragePool-10),  [opset 11](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/main/docs/Changelog.md#AveragePool-11),  [opset 19](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/main/docs/Changelog.md#AveragePool-19)\r\nNecessary help will be provided by ONNX Fronted team.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What needs to be done?\r\n\r\nOperator details can be found in [ONNX Operators](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/main/docs/Operators.md#AveragePool)\r\nMore details can be found in ONNX Changelog: [opset 7](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/main/docs/Changelog.md#AveragePool-7),  [opset 10](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/main/docs/Changelog.md#AveragePool-10),  [opset 11](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/main/docs/Changelog.md#AveragePool-11),  [opset 19](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/main/docs/Changelog.md#AveragePool-19)\r\n1. Operator already has a common implementation in OpenVINO. First of all, you need to review a documentation and prepare a table with differences between versions. It could be, for instance, a missing property, extended/reduced coverage of existing property, etc...\r\n2. Copy existing implementation [here](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/tree/master/src/frontends/onnx/frontend/src/op) to make it aligned with original framework (extend or reduce coverage of a common implementation). Copy of modified implementation should be in a defined opset, or in opset 1 in case it implements oldest implementation. [Example of multi-opset operation](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/src/frontends/onnx/frontend/src/op/softmax.cpp#L50).\r\n3. Register the function in [ops_bridge.cpp](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/src/frontends/onnx/frontend/src/ops_bridge.cpp#L554-L560) while keeping alphabetical order\r\n4. Create test model(s) in [ONNX models directory](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/tree/master/src/frontends/onnx/tests/models/). OpenVINO test infrastructure then converts prototxt files to ONNX models - you will use those models later in tests\r\n5. Add tests covering all use cases [here](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/src/frontends/onnx/tests/onnx_import.in.cpp)\r\n6. Check [Python xfailed tests](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/src/frontends/onnx/tests/tests_python/test_backend.py) to find a test marked as a xfailed for added functionality. If any exist - remove corresponding lines and try to verify by using cmdline \"python -m pytest -k name_of_test\".\r\nMore details in [adding operators to ONNX Frontend guide](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/src/frontends/onnx/docs/how_to_add_op.md)\r\n\r\n### Example Pull Requests\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\n\r\n- [Contribution guide - start here!](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n- [Intel DevHub Discord channel](https://discord.gg/wPuqAujS) - engage in discussions, ask questions and talk to OpenVINO developers\r\n- [What is OpenVINO?](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino#what-is-openvino-toolkit)\r\n- [User documentation](https://docs.openvino.ai/)\r\n- Guides on [ONNX Frontend architecture](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/src/frontends/onnx/docs/architecture.md) and [ONNX Frontend tests](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/src/frontends/onnx/docs/tests.md) are also available\r\n- You can also see a [blog post on contributing to OpenVINO](https://medium.com/openvino-toolkit/how-to-contribute-to-an-ai-open-source-project-c741f48e009e)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Contact points\r\n\r\n@gkrivor\r\n\r\n### Ticket\r\n\r\n_No response_",

I thought about something like this, it should be enough:\r\nhttps://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/src/frontends/onnx/frontend/src/op/softmax.cpp\r\n\r\nCurrently, biggest problem which requires are alignment/refactoring is a \"some common implementation\" of a translation function. What does it mean? It means it looks like as an any of documented opset (for example, 7,10,11,19), but doesn't implement exact opset functionality (allows to use an undocumented input types, use wrong inputs, etc).\r\n\r\nThat's why we want to align behavior with the original documentation. Because otherwise, when you pass a model with a 19 opset it fails due to a common implementation uses wrong input (input instead of an attribute, as example), but you will get any possible error and will spend a lot of time to understand what goes wrong. I'm sure previous approach was very good for a fast implementation.

The site closely mimics Netflix's design and branding. Browsers may sometimes flag clone sites, especially if they look like login pages for popular services as a phishing risk even if the site is harmless.\n2. similar Vercel subdomains then the subdomains can be flagged\n\n\n### \uD83D\uDEE0??? Proposed Solution / Steps to Reproduce\n\nSolution:\n1. Adding a visible disclaimer in the site: \"This is a clone for educational purposes. No real data is collected.\"\n2. Avoid mimicking actual login/signup forms same as Netflix.\n\n\n### ???

Once you implement in pharmaversesdtm, you can come back to this issue and use the new `dm` dataset to add AAGE/AAGEU to the ADSL template \uD83D\uDE04 \n\nPlease let @Lina2689 / @Fanny-Gautier know if you don't have access to pharmaversesdtm.", "If `Birth Date` is added to `pharmaversesdtm::dm`, it's important to double-check and list all _{admiral}_ extension packages that may be impacted by this update. For example, review where `dm` is used, as those packages may now include this new variable by default - even though `AGE` may have been manually derived or `Birth Date` manually added. I'm thinking of _{admiralpeds}_, where `BRTHDTC` was manually added in `dm_peds`. This change could have an impact, so it???s worth reviewing when the time comes.", "Thanks for making me aware of this! Is there somewhere we can see the dependencies? I would assume `dm` is used almost everywhere. I think it could be nice to have an overview of it before I start to make any changes ready.\nAlternatively, could it be an idea to add a \"new\" `dm` version called `dm_admiral`, as done with `dm_peds` if I understand you correctly?", "@SolveigHolmgaard it's a good question.\n\nLuckily we store the SDTM test data for all the {admiral} packages in the centralised [{pharmaversesdtm}](https://github.com/pharmaverse/pharmaversesdtm) package repo. You can see in the [data_raw](https://github.com/pharmaverse/pharmaversesdtm/tree/main/data-raw) folder that we already have a `dm.R` program which essentially just loads in the DM dataset from the CDISC pilot study, and then we currently have `dm_peds.R`, `dm_vaccine.R`, `dm_metabolic.R` which use `dm.R` as a starting point. As such I would take a look at those three files and assess the impact of adding `BRTHDTC` to `dm.R`, and make edits to them as well if need be. For instance, since `BRTHDTC` will now be (re)derived in `dm_peds.R` then perhaps we'll just need to pre-emptively drop `BRTHDTC` from DM at the start of that script. I'd also check out the other SDTM programs in that data-raw folder just to verify `BRTHDTC` is not used there, but I'd be very surprised if it were.\n\nOne final thing to note is that currently {admiralneuro}'s test SDTM datasets still live in the {admiralneuro} repo (we only move test data to {pharmaversesdtm} once the first release of a package is live) so for completeness I'd also assess impact similarly for that package - see [here](https://github.com/pharmaverse/admiralneuro/tree/main/data-raw))", "@manciniedoardo Thanks a lot for the answer!\n\nIt sounds like a bit of a rabbit hole of a task, but I guess it is like that more often than not \uD83D\uDE04 \nI have a small vacation next week, but I will start to look into it when I get back." ],

But currently, we have no easy way of navigate back up to the top, which would be good if one enters on this level and cannot use the back button.\n\n### Examples and inspiration\n\n_No response_",

New to contributing here, interested in giving this a go with a little guidance. Having some issues building the site with snowman.", "A more user-friendly alternative to a back button is implementing a breadcrumb navigation component for each page.\n\nFor example:\n`Home / United Kingdom / Scotland`\n\nIn this structure, Home, United Kingdom, and Scotland act as clickable links that allow users to navigate directly to their respective pages.\n\nUsing a back button can create a confusing experience, especially if the user arrived from an unrelated page. In such cases, pressing ???Back??? might take them somewhere unexpected, whereas breadcrumbs provide clear and predictable navigation.", "Breadcrumbs are interesting, but if used, should be used across all pages, not just on federal subjects. So that would be a much larger scope of work. \n\nAs a sidenote, the logical trace would be:\n\n`Home / Countries / United Kingdom / Scotland`\n\nAs a gut feeling, implementing breadcrumbs is overkill. I believe we just need something simple on pages for federal subjects. ", "Hi everyone! \nI went through the discussion, and I agree that keeping things simple (rather than full breadcrumbs) is ideal for now.\n\nHere???s a suggestion that could work as a minimal, user-friendly solution:\n\n1. Add a small ???Back to Country??? link/button\n??? Right above the federal subject title (or near the top of the page), place a simple link like:\n??? Back to United Kingdom\nThis is:\nClear (shows the parent country name)\nLightweight (no extra UI components needed)\nConsistent (can be reused easily across similar pages)\n2. Auto-generate the parent link dynamically\n??? Based on the federal subject???s data, extract its country relationship (e.g., ???Scotland??? ??? ???United Kingdom???).\n3. Responsive Design Consideration\n??? On mobile, the link could be styled smaller or placed within a dropdown to save space.\nHappy to contribute a quick prototype. Let me know your thoughts " ],

Move all `@Path(\"entries/{entryId}\")` annotated methods to `BibEntryResource.java` (which needs to be created)\n2. Add BibEntryResource to `org.jabref.http.server.Server#startServer`\n3.

Create `BibEntryResourceTest.java` similar to `org.jabref.http.server.LibraryResourceTest`, but test BibEntry---\n\n`@Path(\"entries/pdffiles\")` annoted methods should be kept.

The actions-user bot will reset the file back to previous state for the next contributor after your commit is merged. So you can just simply start working with the issue right away!*\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\n-   Your task is to create a simple card component in React that displays a random image.\r\n\r\nStart by navigating inside of the directory used in this project with the command:\r\n```bash\r\ncd tasks/react/easy/react-easy\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen run `npm i` to install Vite, React and all the necessary dependencies for the project.\r\n\r\nAfter installing the dependencies you can open the `src` directory and `App.jsx` file, and start implementing your solution!\r\n\r\n![react-easy](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/assets/82566656/8cecb0af-abd9-477c-bd28-13381828c696)\r\n\r\nAll the CSS classes needed in this project has already been done for you in `index.css`.\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\n-   Add all the components inside of the `div` that has class `center`.\r\n-   Add `h1` tag with the text \"React/Vite - Easy\" in it.\r\n-   Add a `div` with a class `card`.\r\n-   Inside the card-div, add `img` tag with this as source: \"https://loremflickr.com/320/240\". It will create a random image for the card.\r\n-   Add `h2` tag with text \"Card Title\" inside of it.\r\n-   Finally, add a `p` tag with text \"Card Description\" in it.\r\n\r\nAfter you are done with the card, make sure you are in the `tasks/react/easy/react-easy` in your terminal and run `npm run dev` to start the Vite server. Then, open \"http://localhost:5173/\" in your browser to check how the card looks.\r\n\r\nIf the card looks fine, you are ready to make a pull request!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo work with this issue, you need to have npm and NodeJS installed to your local machine.\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions of installing npm and NodeJS as well as how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Why use Vite?\r\n\r\nThis React project uses Vite for near-instant server start-ups and incredibly fast hot module replacements, providing a smooth and efficient development experience.\r\nAlso Vite requires minimal setup, allowing us to focus on writing React code without getting bogged down in complex configurations.\r\nIf you want to learn more about Vite, check out the documentation:\r\n[Vite Official Documentation](https://vitejs.dev/)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

The actions-user bot will reset the file back to previous state for the next contributor after your commit is merged. So you can just simply start working with the issue right away!*\r\n\r\n### How to get started\r\n\r\nOpen the `tasks/html/medium` directory from the root of your project.\r\nThen open the `index.html` file and start implementing your solution!\r\n\r\n![html-medium](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/assets/82566656/1a142585-adc1-40e6-b71e-ee24d63c3882)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe goal of this task is to create a contact form in `index.html` inside the container using HTML. There are also some styles added in `styles.css` but you don't need to modify that code, it is there just for styling purposes.\r\n\r\nThe form should include the following fields:\r\n\r\n-   Name (text input)\r\n-   Email (email input)\r\n-   Message (textarea)\r\n-   Submit button\r\n\r\nPlease note that at this stage, the form doesn't need to submit data to any server-side script. Purpose of this task is to just create the form visually without any functionality.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you are using VS Code and have for example Live Server extension, you can simply open `index.html` with the server and check how the form looks. After the form is done, you are ready to make a pull request!\r\nIf you do not have Live Server extension, you'll find information about installing and how to use it [here](https://www.donskytech.com/visual-studio-code-live-server/).\r\n\r\n*Note: Only the `index.html` file needs modification for this task.*\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions and how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

The actions-user bot will reset the file back to previous state for the next contributor after your commit is merged. So you can just simply start working with the issue right away!*\r\n\r\n### How to get started:\r\n\r\nStart by navigating inside of the directory used in this project with the command:\r\n```bash\r\ncd tasks/react/medium/traffic-light\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen run `npm i` to install Vite, React and all the necessary dependencies for the project.\r\n\r\nAfter installing the dependencies you can open the `src` directory and the `TrafficLight.tsx` file, and start implementing your solution!\r\n\r\n![react-medium](https://github.com/fork-commit-merge/fork-commit-merge/assets/82566656/e154750d-41fd-4db4-bcc6-9dd52c7e55d6)\r\n\r\n### Description:\r\n\r\nCreate a React component using TypeScript that simulates a traffic light. The component should display three lights (red, yellow, and green) and switch between them automatically in the order of a typical traffic light sequence.\r\n\r\n### Requirements:\r\n\r\n-   Implement a `TrafficLight` component in `src/TrafficLight.tsx`.\r\n-   Use TypeScript for type safety.\r\n-   The component should render three circles, colored red, yellow, and green.\r\n-   The traffic light should start with the red light.\r\n-   After a few seconds, it should change to green, then yellow, and then back to red in a continuous loop.\r\n-   Only one light should be \"active\" (brighter) at a time.\r\n\r\nThere are some CSS classes already added for you in the `src/App.css` file, which you can use if you like, or write your own custom CSS.\r\nThere is for example a helper pseudo-class selector for every light that is not active, which will set the light color to gray if the light does not have the `active` class:\r\n\r\n![react-medium-css](https://github.com/fork-commit-merge/fork-commit-merge/assets/82566656/052aaf61-e4d9-40b9-8876-bf96aa2ada9c)\r\n\r\n### Example:\r\n\r\nThe traffic light should cycle as follows:\r\n\r\n-   Red (active) for 4 seconds.\r\n-   Green (active) for 3 seconds.\r\n-   Yellow (active) for 1 second.\r\n-   Repeat the cycle.\r\n\r\n## How to run:\r\nAfter you are done with the card, make sure you are in the `tasks/react/medium/traffic-light` in your terminal and run `npm run dev` to start the Vite server. Then, open \"http://localhost:5173/\" in your browser to check how the app looks.\r\n\r\nIf it looks to be working fine, you are ready to make a pull request!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo work with this issue, you need to have npm and NodeJS installed to your local machine.\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions of installing npm and NodeJS as well as how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Why use Vite?\r\n\r\nThis React project uses Vite for near-instant server start-ups and incredibly fast hot module replacements, providing a smooth and efficient development experience.\r\nAlso Vite requires minimal setup, allowing us to focus on writing React code without getting bogged down in complex configurations.\r\nIf you want to learn more about Vite, check out the documentation:\r\n[Vite Official Documentation](https://vitejs.dev/)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",
