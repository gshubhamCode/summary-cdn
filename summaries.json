      "url" : "https://github.com/apache/sedona-db/issues/224",
      "repositoryName" : "apache/sedona-db",
      "description" : "Many functions involve complex algorithms, so we use a library like as [geos](https://github.com/georust/geos) to implement the logic for us. Most of these should be pretty straight forward and easy to implement, since it's just calling a library function. These implementations should go in the `c/sedona-geos/` directory (\"c/\" instead of \"rust/\" because the library is using bindings for a C library). Most of the geos geometry methods are shown in this [geometry.rs](https://github.com/georust/geos/blob/master/src/geometry.rs) file (e.g `is_valid()` can be used to implement Sedona's ST_IsValid). This issue lists functions that we can leverage the `geos` library to implement the logic. All of these functions have a method in `geos` that we can use to implement these functions directly.

      "comments" : [ "@paleolimbot Let me know if you want to stick with this approach of focusing on `c/geos` for now, or if you would rather try implementing some in `rust/geo` directly. We do have the PostGIS integration tests set up now, so we can rely on those for correctness.", "I???d prefer using rust/geo. We???ve been leveraging the geo-trait in rust/geo to minimize overhead, which leads to a significant reduction compared to using geos.\n\nCC @Kontinuation ", "Yeah, that makes more sense to me. Dewey originally wanted me to focus on `geos` and not `rust/geo`. I think (but not 100% certain) it was because `geos` was \"ground truth\" in the cases where behavior differs, and we could implement `geo` later for performance. The thing is, we now have the integration tests to catch correctness issues, so I don't see a reason to duplicate work any more. If we're all good with prioritizing `geo` instead, then I'll close this and create a new one for `rust/geo`.", "I think it is still productive to implement these with GEOS for any function that is a trivial wrapper around the GEOS operation (I think this list is a good characterization of those functions). This will give us passing tests and function coverage for very little investment while we prioritize the engineereing capacity required to make specific functions faster.", "(In other words, I agree with Jia but that is a separate issue. We can't make functions faster that don't exist).", "If a function **already** has an implementation in `rust/geo`'s [algorithm](https://github.com/georust/geo/tree/8940db79aa6aa4ec8820d6328c68a2ae08ac8fdc/geo/src/algorithm) package, shouldn't implementing `geo` instead be the **same amount** of time/effort? If it's the same amount of effort, why not make them exist in the faster library first, so we don't need to duplicate our efforts implementing them in `geos` too?\n\nFor example, we implemented ST_Centroid using `geo` in [this PR](https://github.com/apache/sedona-db/pull/33). And there seems to be [a lot more](https://github.com/georust/geo/tree/8940db79aa6aa4ec8820d6328c68a2ae08ac8fdc/geo/src/algorithm) that we can leverage (e.g concave_hull, simplify, etc).", "Adopting the original `rust/geo` algorithms and GEOS is both easy. Leveraging the geo-trait in `rust/geo` requires porting existing geo algorithms to sedona-geo-generic-alg, which is a non-trivial amount of work.\n\nWe can onboard more functions by directly bridging `rust/geo` or GEOS, and optimize those functions that are frequently used, and leveraging geo-trait brings significant performance benefit.", "I'm happy to review + merge PRs implementing either (although I am not sure with this level of discussion on the ticket we will get any contributions for these functions).\n\nI still prefer having the GEOS functions + integration tests implemented first so that we can measure the relative performance of the geo algorithm when we implement it. Most geo algorithms are faster but there has been at least one case (prepared geometry) where the cost of creating the GEOS object still resulted in better performance. If we don't implement the GEOS version, we can't know.", "Makes sense. I forgot `geo-traits` is different than the `geo` algorithms. Focusing on `geos` sounds good." ],

What I wrote up there is obvious nonsense. \r\n\r\nLooking at a low power nose cone from my parts box, there isn't any obvious internal \"step\", the thickness of the shoulder is the thickness of the nose cone minus the thickness of the matching body tube. So a PNC-50KA nose cone has a base diameter of 2.48cm and a wall thickness of .157cm; it mates with a BT-50A body tube with a .033cm wall thickness so the shoulder thickness should be .157-.033=.124mm.

To highlight that further, if you call bedrock with an empty content block, you will receive the following error message:\n```txt\nMust set one of the following keys for tagged unionstructure messages[0].content[0]: text, image, document, video, toolUse, toolResult, guardContent, reasoningContent.\n```\nIf you call with multiple members, you get:\n```txt\nInvalid number of parameters set for tagged union structure messages[0].content[0]. Can only set one of the following keys: text, image, document, video, toolUse, toolResult, guardContent, reasoningContent.\n```\n\nWith all that said, we did not correctly define the type on our end. The correct type definition should actually be something like:\n```Python\nclass ContentBlockDocument(TypedDict):\n    document: DocumentContent\n\nclass ContentBlockGuardContent(TypedDict):\n    guardContent: GuardContent\n\n...\n\nContentBlock = Union[ContentBlockDocument, ContentBlockGuardContent, ...]\n```",

Frequently close pull requests with ratios of merged to closed PRs approaching 10:1\n1. Repeatedly ignore PR requested changes from reviewers\n1. Resolve Code Rabbit suggestions without implementing them.\n1. Use AI to generate generic plans of action without an in-depth knowledge of the code base.

First because not only Characters could be affected, but also Foes, or other kind of entities. And also because I don't know, they don't look so closely related in my opinion. Effects should be kept rather close to the Effect class, so everything related to effect is around the same place.\r\n\r\nBut maybe I just misunderstood your idea.", "So my point was having a hashmap containing effects and there duration and if an effect has a duration that is not 0 the effect will be applied, but if the duration is none the effect will stay forever, and then you have a the effect take the entity hit by the potion or the attack with effect, and trigger a applyEffectEvent in the entity code, then the entity's code detect that there is a change in the duration of an effect, and applies it to the stats.\r\nI don't know much about the effect in your game so I'm going to make my own for an example:\r\n```py\r\nclass Entity:\r\n    # Just a draft of the initialization process from a effects only POV\r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n        self.effects = {'stun': 0, 'speed': 0, 'health_boost': 0, 'strength': 0}\r\n        self.entityType = 'player'\r\n        self.speed = 60\r\n        self.strength = 50\r\n        self.health = 100\r\n\r\n    # Very rough, but you get the point\r\n    def applyEffectEvent(self, effect, duration):\r\n        if not effect in self.effects:\r\n            return f\"Effect doesn't apply on {self.entityType}\"\r\n        self.effects[effect] = duration\r\n        self.updateState()\r\n        return \"Effect applied\"\r\n    \r\n\r\n    # I wrote my updateState function to just handle effects\r\n    # Normally it handles everything that needs to be updated\r\n    def updateState(self):\r\n        for effect in self.effects:\r\n            if self.effects[effect] == 0:\r\n                return\r\n            \r\n            if self.effects[effect] == None:\r\n                match effect:\r\n                    case \"speed\":\r\n                        self.speed += 20\r\n                    case \"strength\":\r\n                        self.strength += 10\r\n                    case \"health_boost\":\r\n                        self.health += 50\r\n                    case \"stun\":\r\n                        self.speed -= 40\r\n                return\r\n            \r\n            # Here you put how you usually apply your effects with a duration\r\n            # Just use self.effects[effect] to get the duration in whatever unit\r\n```", "Ok to be really honest I'm still not sure to get you... It's just that I need to dig further on the subject maybe.\n\nHaving an hashmap (dict in Python) is an idea I like: maps/dict is always better than a sequence of if/else statements in my opinion, it's cleaner.\n\nBut I don't understand why effect logic should be in entity instead of in... Its own class. And I don't get what would be the pros of following this approach.", "OK I'll explain further:\r\n\r\n## Using a Hash Map to store the effects on the entity instead of on a separate class :\r\n### Pros :\r\n1. Assume you have multiple entity types, humanoids, goblins, elfs, animals... Having each class for these entities have its own Hash Map of effects is beneficial, because there might be some effects that should not work on that type, example:\r\n- Blindness on a Goblin shouldn't work because they might already live in the dark, they can't see either way\r\n- Strength on an Elf shouldn't work because Elfs usually are either ranged attack or magic attack types\r\n\r\n2. Instead of having one class that goes through a lot of if-else statements, you have multiple entities, which can accept or deny the effect, and then apply the effect on an intensity suitable to that entity type, you could also have some built-in limit for an effect on each entity separately, which might be helpful to fix entities judged to be too _'OP'_.\r\n> If you have some experience with coding video games, having a lot of if-else statements is a bad habit, you should know that even games made with languages with faster run times than python struggle with a big amount of if-else statements, (Yandere Simulator is an example)\r\n\r\n3. Finally the class that used to handle the effect application, you could make it a base that contains how to trigger an effect appliance on the entity, and then make any object that can apply an effect inherit that part so you don't have to hard code it every time, you only inherit, initialize the effect information and function to the super class, it's easier this way.\r\n\r\n### Cons :\r\n1. The only downside is that you have to hard-code how each entity handles effects but that could be for the better\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# PLEASE, If you don't get something let me know.", "@IliyasDev sorry for the late answer, I was a bit busy working on other projects and needed to dig back in the code to be able to answer you correctly.\r\n\r\n> Assume you have multiple entity types, humanoids, goblins, elfs, animals... Having each class for these entities have its own Hash Map of effects is beneficial, because there might be some effects that should not work on that type, example:\r\n\r\nYou are right, the actual effect on the entity may depends on their characteristics in a foreseeable, but it is not right now.\r\nThey could not really be a specific dict/map by character race because races are not reflected as distinct classes in code, because character races are not directly affecting the behavior of the character: an elf and a dwarf are still both living playable entities. \uD83D\uDE04 \r\nClass and race are only **attributes**.\r\nTo come back to the original point, tbh I didn't really think yet of the design for effects that may differ across Characters/Foes. It may be better maybe to just override the definition of `Movable.set_alteration` to verify if the given entity can be affected by the alteration according to its race, class or other criteria.\r\n\r\nAlso, different map for every possible race and classes in game seems to be too much code duplication to me, because in most cases, entities should be affected the same way by a given effect/alteration. It's only about exceptions.\r\n\r\n> Instead of having one class that goes through a lot of if-else statements, you have multiple entities, which can accept or deny the effect, and then apply the effect on an intensity suitable to that entity type, you could also have some built-in limit for an effect on each entity separately, which might be helpful to fix entities judged to be too 'OP'.\r\n\r\nI think you are trying to explain what is **polymorphism**. \r\nWhile I definitely agree with your point (this pattern should be followed as much as possible), I unfortunately don't think it's applicable to this situation, because of what I explained before: Goblins and Elfs are only different values for `Character.race` attribute, not different _in-code_ classes.\r\nAlso, I'm a bit skeptical about the if-statements Yandere story, I heard about it quite a lot of times, but at the end, I think the issue was more about the lack of consistent design and basic logic rules not followed correctly (i.e., same conditions were checked again and again in the same frames). But I'm not an expert on Yandere's game code.\r\nI just don't think if-else statements are that bad, at least not for perfs. Performance issues are more about wrong architecture and logical ordering decisions ; it's mainly redundant / unnecessary condition checks that can have an impact.\r\n\r\n> Finally the class that used to handle the effect application, you could make it a base that contains how to trigger an effect appliance on the entity, and then make any object that can apply an effect inherit that part so you don't have to hard code it every time, you only inherit, initialize the effect information and function to the super class, it's easier this way.\r\n\r\nNot sure to get that part. Entities should not inherit from Effects.. Because they are not Effects.. Did you just mean that the application of an effect should be reversed? Like instead of having the method `Effect.apply_on_ent(entity)` there would be `Entity.apply_effect(effect)`? \r\n\r\nAnyway, I definitely agree about the different pieces needing some refactoring: the init method of `Effect` could be generify to avoid having if-else statements sharing all a similar logic, and instead use a kind of map access to the details of the effect from the XML file.\r\n`Effect.apply_on_ent` method also needs to be refactored, and if-else statements should probably be removed as well.\r\n\r\nLastly, I think documentation for both `Alteration` and `Effect` classes should be improved, because after reading them back, I noticed they could be quite confusing.\r\n\r\n_Please don't hesitate to argue more if you disagree with one of my point, I'm just sharing my personal feelings about it_" ],

Please describe\n\nAs a follow-up on https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/issues/18723, I noticed other stats related classes should also utilize Builder pattern to initialize stats objects.\n\nFor example IndexingStats currently has 2 constructors: https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/blob/main/server/src/main/java/org/opensearch/index/shard/IndexingStats.java#L191-L246\n\nStats related classes are exposed as PublicApi, and stats are frequently (or maybe once in a while but need to be) incremented, which causes backward-compatibility to break. This makes it difficult to add new metrics and evolve the API without causing significant disruption for developers who have adopted it. Each new stat forces a major version bump and requires users to update their code, even if they don't need the new metric.\n\nUsing this issue to track all such metric/stats classes to adopt to builder pattern and mark the existing public constructors to be on deprecation path. \n\nReference from SearchStats: https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/pull/18707\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n- List down all classes to be actioned from stats API / code dive deep\n- Create builder pattern for those classes\n- Mark existing constructors as deprecated\n\n### Related component\n\nOther\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

I???ll reach out if I run into any difficulties. \uD83D\uDC4D ", "Hello, @sandeshkr419 I???m planning to work on this and would like to confirm a few details:\n\n**First**  \nI identified a few different patterns of how `Stats` classes are currently defined:  \n\n1. **Pattern 1**: Using `Stats` as an inner class & exposed as Public API  \n   - [`IndexStats`  ](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/blob/main/server/src/main/java/org/opensearch/action/admin/indices/stats/IndexStats.java)\n   - [`RemoteTranslogTransferTracker` ](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/blob/main/server/src/main/java/org/opensearch/index/remote/RemoteTranslogTransferTracker.java) \n\n2. **Pattern 2**: Using `Stats` as an inner class & marked as internal API  \n   - [`CpuUsageTracker`  ](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/blob/main/server/src/main/java/org/opensearch/search/backpressure/trackers/CpuUsageTracker.java)\n\n3. **Pattern 3**: No inner `Stats` class, using constructor directly & exposed as Public API  \n   - [`RefreshStats`  ](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/blob/main/server/src/main/java/org/opensearch/index/refresh/RefreshStats.java)\n\nI plan to include these patterns in the scope of the builder refactor. Does that align with your expectation?\nOr would you prefer that the scope only covers Pattern 1 and Pattern 2, and leaves out Pattern 3?\n\n**Second**  \nMy plan is to list the target classes and define their `Builder` implementations first, and handle the actual constructor ??? builder migration in a follow-up step. Is this the right approach?\n\n\n**Third**  \nFor deprecation comments, I???ll mark the existing constructors as ???will be removed in 4.0??? for consistency across all classes. Please confirm if that???s correct.\n\n\nLet me know if this approach makes sense, and I???ll proceed accordingly.", "@pado0 - I'd suggest pick up the individual classes as separate PRs and do the following:\n1/ Create a builder pattern for the inner stats\n2/ Mark the constructors as deprecated. \n3/ Migrate (refactor) any earlier usage of constructors to your newly created builder patterns in source/test code.\n\nHaving small isolated PRs makes the review quick and easier to merge.\n\nNow coming to the stats classes you listed:\n\n----\n\nPattern 1: Using Stats as an inner class & exposed as Public API\n\n[IndexStats](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/blob/main/server/src/main/java/org/opensearch/action/admin/indices/stats/IndexStats.java) - This looks abstracted out nicely already with not exposing individual stats.

as any new metrics would require a new constructor.", "@sandeshkr419 Thanks for the comments!\n\nI reviewed Cluster / Node / Shard / Indices stats (and other metrics) to see where a Stats class is present,\nand grouped all stats-related classes into two patterns that are candidates for introducing the Builder pattern.\nAll of them are PublicAPI and expose public constructors.\n\nFor each class, I will:\n1. introduce a Builder,\n2. mark existing public constructors as @Deprecated, and\n3. refactor usages (including tests) to the new Builder.\n\nThe list is sorted by priority, and I???ll open small, isolated PRs per class in that order.\nIf anything looks off, I???m happy to take feedback on the individual PRs and adjust accordingly.\n\nAnd feedback at any time is very welcome :) Thank you!\n\n### Pattern 1: Using Stats as an inner class & exposed as Public API\n- [x]

If there are mutliple `RabbitTemplates` beans, the logic takes the first one (without order criteria/guarantee).\n\nI would like to have more control/customization possibilities of the `RabbitTemplate` resolve mechanism, e.g. taking the exchange-name and/or routing-key into account.\n\n**Motivation**\nMy app uses multiple RabbitTemplates; one for each scenario/business uses case. The routing-key is pre-configured in the corresponding `RabbitTemplate` so that the business code has no awareness of routing key specific things.  When sending payloads via SpringWolf-UI I would like to publish the message via the corresponding RabbitTemplate and not any one.\n\n**Technical details**\nSome kind of `strategy` or `resolver` mechanism should suffice. The default implementation copies the current logic (taking 1st RabbitTemplate)\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nCurrently, I have to overwrite/re-implement the whole `SpringwolfAmqpProducer#send(String channelName, Object payload)` method :-(\n",

Let me know!", "Hello @vrdn-23 and @webknjaz,\r\n\r\nI tried to fix #924 locally and after a few iterations of a simplification I realized that the [`test_load_from_file`](https://github.com/aio-libs/multidict/blob/master/tests/test_pickle.py#L24-L38) test doesn't increase coverage since there's already the [`test_pickle`](https://github.com/aio-libs/multidict/blob/master/tests/test_pickle.py#L9-L14) test that **does exactly the same**, but in a more elegant and easy to understand way. If I didn't miss something, it's implicitly parametrized enough to cover all the cases. The only difference is that the initial implementation of `test_load_from_file` checks whether data pickled with some previous version of the `multidict` library still can be unpickled and matched with the current version data, but _if you are going to eliminate the corresponding files_, it seems reasonable to drop the `test_load_from_file` completely and rely on the `test_pickle` instead.\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef test_pickle(any_multidict_class, pickle_protocol):\r\n    d = any_multidict_class([(\"a\", 1), (\"a\", 2)])\r\n    pbytes = pickle.dumps(d, pickle_protocol)\r\n    obj = pickle.loads(pbytes)\r\n    assert d == obj\r\n    assert isinstance(obj, any_multidict_class)\r\n```\r\n\r\n@webknjaz what do you think?\r\n\r\n@vrdn-23, in case @webknjaz decide to keep this test, it would be better to use `io.BytesIO` in order to keep `pickle.dumps`/`pickle.loads` and not switch to `pickle.dump`/`pickle.load`, so the `test_load_from_file` would verify what its name suggests.", "Feel free to submit an alternative PR.", "I concluded that we should integrate one of pytest-harvest, pytest-datadir, python-pytest-cases or pytest-regressions instead. This needs some research.", "Sorry, I object to removing pickle files stored on the disk.\n\nThese files were added intentionally to ensure that newer multidict versions still could read older pickles.\nAll this code was added during the bugfix for an accident with broken backward compatibility.\n\n@webknjaz please feel free to reword the issue to keep pickle files and the generator. Honestly, I prefer keeping everything as is but moving `tests/gen_pickles.py` file to `tools` folder.", "Using a proper pytest plugin will address this. Being so disorganized what was prompted the idea of removal since it wasn't obvious what the purpose was. Using a plugin will communicate that clearly.", "I'm ok with a plugin if it keeps pickled files in the git tree.", "Plugins to choose from:\n* `pytest-harvest`:  https://smarie.github.io/python-pytest-harvest\n* `syrupy`: https://til.simonwillison.net/pytest/syrupy / https://syrupy-project.github.io/syrupy\n* `pytest-insta`: https://github.com/vberlier/pytest-insta\n* `inline-snapshot`:  https://15r10nk.github.io/inline-snapshot\n\n`syrupy` and `inline-snapshot` look quite active.

Here's that's project's [ESLint config](https://github.com/ProjectEvergreen/www.greenwoodjs.dev/blob/main/eslint.config.js) for reference (we don't need the markdown configuration though)\r\n- We should add a note to the [_CONTRIBUTING.md_](https://github.com/ProjectEvergreen/wcc/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) with whatever workflow we end up with\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nAs we have a few PRs and release in active development, my recommendation would be to wait until all those PRs land first, or just do it as the first change once we cut the v0.16.0 release\r\nhttps://github.com/ProjectEvergreen/wcc/issues?q=label%3A0.16.0+",

Terrakube Helm chart deployed with `terrakube-prod` Helm release name will lead to the default Redis instance service name being `terrakube-prod-redis-master`.\n\nHowever Terrakube Helm API config is hardcoded to look for a Redis instance named `terrakube-redis-master`, see https://github.com/terrakube-io/terrakube-helm-chart/blob/8d0e24db9a89e36bb60377c650db5842de2dca69/charts/terrakube/templates/secrets-api.yaml#L27.\n\nSo in case Terrakube Helm chart gets deployed with a Helm release name different than `terrakube` then the installation will fail, as the Terrakube API component will look for a Redis instance name which will not exist.\n\nWorkaround:\n\n```yaml\n# Fix a hardcoded Redis hostname bug:\n# The deployed Redis instance will have a dynamic name based on the Helm release name, see:\n# - https://github.com/bitnami/charts/blob/e07d3319b61f49ddf6f431da3ed7ec0e0be3d5d0/bitnami/redis/templates/master/service.yaml#L10C19-L10C69\n# - https://github.com/bitnami/charts/blob/e07d3319b61f49ddf6f431da3ed7ec0e0be3d5d0/bitnami/common/templates/_names.tpl#L21-L38\n# But Terrakube's API config is hardcoded to look for a Redis instance named \"terrakube-redis-master\", see:\n# - https://github.com/terrakube-io/terrakube-helm-chart/blob/8d0e24db9a89e36bb60377c650db5842de2dca69/charts/terrakube/templates/secrets-api.yaml#L27\n# Therefore override the deployed Redis instance name to the expected hardcoded name\n# This issue is tracked here: https://github.com/terrakube-io/terrakube-helm-chart/issues/225\nredis:\n  fullnameOverride: \"terrakube-redis\"\n```\n\nProposed fix:\n- In the generated Terrakube Helm chart `terrakube-api-secrets` secret, `TerrakubeRedisHostname` should be set dynamically to the actual Redis instance name (that gets generated inside the Bitnami Redis Helm chart dependency) instead of being hardcoded to `terrakube-redis-master`.\n- Or at least document that no other Helm release name than `terrakube` is supported",

      "description" : "Problem: Tests in the suite are occasionally moved around in the file, or their descriptions are clarified, or they are modified because they have a bug. Given that the intended use of the test suite is that downstream users -- (all implementations, Bowtie, other research use cases) -- be able to *run* the tests, they do not have a way to \"track\" a test over time. Specifically, say an implementation has a known issue with a specific test for `$dynamicRef` -- a test case called `$dynamicRef flubs the bub when you bla bla`. An implementer who wishes to mark this test as a TODO in their test suite has no reliable way to do so over the long term, because it's name, position within the file, or even file itself may change here upstream for various reasons.\r\n\r\nWe should therefore introduce a stable ID which we *guarantee* will never change for a test, even if its description changes, or if the test is moved elsewhere within the file or suite.\r\n\r\nA [\"slug\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_URL#Slug) is likely the simplest choice structure-wise, in that it's derivable from the existing test descriptions. UUIDs or globally incrementing integers are other options (see below for considerations).\r\n\r\nThis addition should also include a sanity check ensuring that the IDs have the properties we wish of them (i.e. uniqueness, see below).\r\n\r\nFor context, we had previously added this exact concept to the test case schema in a PR #53 but did not ever add it to tests \r\n\r\nConsiderations:\r\n* The IDs should likely be *version-wide* unique -- i.e. not simply within one file, though also not necessarily across the whole test suite. This is to ensure we can move tests *between* files if we ever recategorize them (c.f. e.g. #630 which we ultimately haven't done, but we have in other cases) This would mean a true \"global\" ID for a test would be the composite ID `(version, ID)`.\r\n* We should spend a moment considering whether IDs should be historically unique as well -- i.e. if we delete a test for whatever reason, not reuse the ID we gave it.\r\n* If a test was *incorrect*, we should likely *change* it's ID, given that anyone referencing it has possibly skipped it because they indeed had the correct behavior -- but this may need a bit more thought.\r\n* We may need to be more precise in the future in cases where we modify a test in deciding whether the new test is the \"same\" and therefore should keep its ID or \"new\" in which case it should get a new one. In general we should err heavily towards never modifying tests in any non-trivial way, so this hopefully will never come up \"in practice\" but it undoubtedly has once or twice previously.\r\n* We need to consider what to do about tests themselves (rather than test cases) -- one would suspect we could rely on the ordering of the test array as IDs for tests, but again, this means we are not able to reliably reorder tests within a test case without disrupting downstream or forcing reliance on their test names. It seems initially then like we should include IDs for tests as well.\r\n* The [test case schema](https://github.com/json-schema-org/JSON-Schema-Test-Suite/blob/main/test-schema.json) will need updating to document and allow this new property. We should initially make the property optional until all tests in the suite have it, at which point we can then require the property.\r\n* We should probably write the above considerations down in the README when merging a PR implementing this.\r\n* Please *do not* send a giant PR which does this for all files all at once. Send small PRs, perhaps one file at a time, or even less, to help reviewers be able to review the PR reasonably.",

Use UUIDs for the IDs, and make them globally unique, rather than just unique within the version of the spec.\r\n2. Using Array index for the tests themselves is extremely brittle - people keep arbitrarily adding tests in the middle of the lists, and it is difficult to enforce. I propose using a UUID for each test within the test suite.\r\n3. I will write a tool to update the IDs for everything and land a complete update all in one go\r\n4. If a test changes in any way, I propose that its ID should be changed, and we should document that in the README\r\n5.

UUIDs would be simpler in some respects.\r\nI guess it depends on the intended use case.\r\n\r\nIf someone has a list of tests they skip, having human readable names which partially suggest the sort of test in question, it could be helpful. However, this wouldn't be the best if we agree that IDs should change if the test changes (which I think is a good idea).\r\n\r\nIn that case, I wonder if a simpler approach is to just MD5 the test object... although I suspect because of JSON and object ordering, that might not end up the same depending on various things.\r\n\r\nAll that to say, are we convinced UUIDs as IDs would be the best here?", "I did consider an MD5 hash of the test object (and the schema in the case of the test case) but that makes it rather harder to generate while developing the tests, and feels like a barrier to entry.", "I don't really have any strong preference on the structure of the IDs -- I think I mentioned I think slugs are better because of the extra benefit (of being user readable and usable for other reasons in isolation) but if I'm not doing the work I definitely don't care.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I *do* care about is:\r\n\r\n> I will write a tool to update the IDs for everything and land a complete update all in one go\r\n\r\nI don't personally want to (ever) review large automated PRs (and have said elsewhere that as far as I have seen in \"real life\" it's simply impossible for any human to do.) -- meaning I'm happy to review the *script* you write to do this, or else for someone else who thinks it's possible to do the review -- though experience in this repo itself has reaffirmed as far as I'm concerned that this is the case :) -- the last two times I said this (no large automated PRs) and others reviewed it, the PRs indeed introduced subtle test bugs that were fixed over a few months afterwards (not that it took months to fix, it took months to notice, which is often the problem).\r\n\r\nSo yeah, happy to review the script, or else to say \"find any other test suite contributor willing to review the PR\".\r\n\r\nOtherwise I'm fine with UUIDs if you prefer.", "Hello, I'd like to take a shot at this issue.

Open source is slow. Our convention is to give the community at least two weeks to express their opinions.\n\nFrom what I see so far, the open questions are:\n\n1. What kind of identifier will be used: slug, UUID, MD5, something else?\n2. What gets an ID? Is it the test-case, the test, or both?\n3. Should IDs be globally unique or unique per version?

Since IDs need to be somewhat readable yet unique, I propose using a semi-readable structure combined with short UUIDs. Here's the idea:\n\n---\n\n### Option 1: Semi-readable + UUIDs (preferred)\n- **Test Case ID:** `<version-timeline>-<filename>-<testcase-uuid>`  \n- **Test ID:** `<version-timeline>-<filename>-<testcase-uuid>-<short-uuid>`  \n\n**Example:**  \n- Test case in `enum.json` for the December 2020 draft: `d20-12-enum-a1b2c3d4e5`  \n- A test within that test case: `d20-12-enum-a1b2c3d4e5-f6g7h8i9j0`\n\n**Pros:**  \n- Always unique.  \n- Won???t change if descriptions or schemas are updated.  \n- Easy to document: we can track just what changed for a given stable ID.  \n\n---\n\n### Option 2: Hash-based IDs\n- **Test Case ID:** `<version-timeline>-<filename>-<testcase-hash>`  \n- **Test ID:** `<version-timeline>-<filename>-<testcase-hash>-<test-hash>`  \n\n**Example:**  \n- Test case hash: `d20-12-enum-9f8e7d6c`  \n- Test within that case: `d20-12-enum-9f8e7d6c-a1b2c3d4`  \n\n**Pros:**  \n- Reflects changes in description or schema automatically.  \n- Shorter IDs.  \n\n**Cons:**  \n- Small chance of collisions.  \n- IDs change whenever a test changes, making historical tracking slightly more complex.  \n\n---\n\nI can also provide an automation script to generate either type of ID if the approach is approved.  \n\nI lean strongly toward Option 1 (UUIDs) as it???s more robust, easier to document, and guarantees uniqueness even across changes.  \n\n", "That's a good start to the conversation.\n\nWhen Ben expressed a preference for readable identifiers, I'm pretty sure he was referring to the test description. For example, my implementation skips a test in `ref.json` with the description, \"$id with file URI still resolves pointers - *nix\". (I don't allow `file:` to be used in `$id` for security reasons.) In my test harness, I have code to skip any test case with that description. That's brittle because if the description changes, my test harness breaks, but it also has the advantage that I can easily remember what test I'm skipping by reading the description. If there's an unreadable identifier in my code instead, then it's harder to keep track of what tests I'm skipping. Your semi-readable identifiers don't address the that concern. \n\nI think there are a couple of more fundamental concerns that need to be decided before we can discuss the identifier further. The first question is whether there needs to be an identifier for the test case, the test, or both. You seem to have chosen both, which I think is probably right, but I'd like to justify that decision. What are the use cases for each? Why is it necessary for _both_ to have an identifier?\n\nThe other fundamental question is to what scope must the identifiers be unique. You seem to have chosen a globally unique identifier. I don't think that's the best choice. Every time we introduce a new version of JSON Schema, we make a copy of the existing tests in a new folder and make changes in the new location. That means we have a bunch of copies of the same test. I think if it's the same test, it should have the same identifier. That would be convenient for my test harness because I could skip the same test in every version I support using one identifier.\n\nSo, let's get agreement on those two fundamental questions first.\n\n1. What needs an identifier? The test case, the test, or both? Why?\n2. What is the scope of uniqueness? Can two identical tests in different versions have the same identifier?", "hi @jdesrosiers ,\n\nmy stance on the fundamental questions are as follows:\n\n**Question 1: What Needs an Identifier?**\n\nI think both test cases AND individual tests need them. your example with the file URI test is exactly the use case. You don't want to skip ALL of ref.json, just that ONE specific test about file URIs. If we only had test case IDs, you'd be stuck skipping entire categories when you really just need surgical precision for one annoying edge case.On the flip side, sometimes you DO want to skip a whole test case (like if you don't support a feature at all). So both levels make sense to me.\n\nBasically:\nTest case IDs = skip whole categories\nIndividual test IDs = skip specific edge cases\nBoth are useful depending on the situation.\n\n**Question 2: Should IDs be version-specific or not?**\n\nOK so I initially suggested version-specific IDs in my earlier comment, but after reading your point, I totally see why that's wrong now.\n\nYou're right - if the same test exists across multiple versions, it should have the same ID.\nI was thinking having version prefixes would make things \"clearer\" but actually it creates a huge problem. When you upgrade from draft2020-12 to draft-next, your skip lists would break even though the tests didn't actually change - they just moved to a different folder. You'd have to update all your skip lists, bug tracking, and documentation just because of a folder move. That's pointless busywork.\n\nWhat makes way more sense (like you said) is having version-independent IDs. Then you can skip the same test across all versions with ONE identifier. The version is already obvious from which folder you're running tests from.\nMy bad on that initial suggestion - your approach is way more practical.\n\n**What should the IDs actually look like?**\n\nI'm thinking hierarchical paths with readable slugs like enum/simple-validation. This solves the readability problem you mentioned - you can actually tell what test you're looking at just by reading the ID. The hierarchical nature with the filename prefix keeps them unique, so we shouldn't run into collision issues. And since there's no version prefix, the same test keeps the same ID whether it's in draft2020-12, draft-next, or any future version. If we do somehow get collisions (which should be rare), we can just append a number like enum/simple-validation-2 or add a short hash suffix like enum/simple-validation-a1b2 to differentiate them.\n\nI think this can solve most of the problem we have with diff types of ids without any readability  or uniqueness trade-offs .\n", "There's a bit of vocabulary confusion happening here. Let's look at an example.\n\n```json\n    {\n        \"description\": \"simple enum validation\",\n        \"schema\": {\n            \"$schema\": \"https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema\",\n            \"enum\": [1, 2, 3]\n        },\n        \"tests\": [\n            {\n                \"description\": \"one of the enum is valid\",\n                \"data\": 1,\n                \"valid\": true\n            },\n            {\n                \"description\": \"something else is invalid\",\n                \"data\": 4,\n                \"valid\": false\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n```\n\nThis is a test case that contains two tests. The question is, do we need to identify each test, just the test case, or both? The individual tests are really the things that need to be skipable. Giving an identifier to the test case as well is just a convenience to skip all of the tests in the test case. In most cases, you'll probably want to skip all the tests, but there are exceptions. For example, the test case for `\"format\": \"date-time\"` includes tests for leap seconds. If your implementation don't support leap seconds, you would want to be able to skip just those tests, not the whole test case.\n\nThat would suggest to me that just identifying the test case isn't good enough. We either need to do both test case and tests or just tests. I'd rather not do both, but would it be too annoying not to be able skip a whole test case?\n\n> What makes way more sense (like you said) is having version-independent IDs. Then you can skip the same test across all versions with ONE identifier. The version is already obvious from which folder you're running tests from.\n\nAgreed. Let's go with that.\n\n> I'm thinking hierarchical paths with readable slugs like enum/simple-validation.\n\nI don't think we want the file name to be part of the slug. Something that has happened occasionally is test cases moving to different files. The identifier should still make sense when the test case moves. I think having \"enum\" in that slug is correct, but because it's a test for the `enum` keyword, not because it's in the enum.json file. So, maybe `enum-simple-validation` instead.\n\nI like this approach. What do you have in mind for giving identifiers to existing tests? Going forward, I expect the test case author to construct them by hand, but filling in identifiers for existing tests will have to be automated. It probably has to be something like `slugify(filename + testCaseDescription + testDescription)`. They won't be the nicest for readability, but it's probably the best we can do other than doing each one manually.\n\nI think the downside of readable slugs is that sometimes descriptions are wrong. I fixed an incorrect description just recently. If the slug contains an incorrect description of the test, we would have to change it, which breaks the original intent of giving the tests identifiers in the first place. The purpose of the identifier is to be something that doesn't change if the description changes. Does that mean slugs aren't a good idea, or do the pros out weigh the cons? I'm not sure. If we don't have readable identifiers, implementers can always use comments next to the opaque identifiers to easily know what they're skipping. So, maybe it's not too terribly important.\n\nNext question: what about enforcement? We'll need a GitHub Action to check that identifiers are unique within a version. Then we need to decide on the rules for when an identifier should change or not. If possible, we should automate checking for that too. If that's not possible to automate, maybe we can introduce a PR template to help remind authors and reviewers to check for those things.\n\nI think if the data changes, the identifier definitely needs to change. But, there are some schema changes that wouldn't require a change. Changing `$schema` usually doesn't change the semantics of schema, but could in some cases. Adding/removing/changing and annotation-only keywords shouldn't change the schema either. Or, should we play it safe and just say any change to the schema should require a new identifier? That rule we could automate and remove the possibility of human error, but could result in some unnecessary identifier churn.\n\n## Summary / Next steps\n\n- We decided on using identifiers that are unique within a version of JSON Schema.\n- We still need to decide whether test cases should have identifiers or just tests.\n- We need to explore the trade-offs of using slugs and decide if we're sure we want to use them.\n- We need to discuss further automation and rules for when identifiers change.", "**Question 1: Test Cases vs Tests - Both Need IDs**\n\nI think we absolutely need both levels of IDs, and the numbers from the actual test suite prove why this is necessary. When you have files with 44-50 individual tests across 22 test cases, having only individual test IDs would be a massive pain for implementers.\nYour leap seconds example is perfect for showing why both levels matter. Sometimes an implementer needs to skip just those 2 specific leap second tests because their datetime library doesn't handle them. But other times, an implementer might not support the entire enum keyword at all, and forcing them to list all 44 individual test IDs in their skip configuration is unreasonable.\nThe two-level system gives implementers the choice: use test case IDs for broad exclusions, use individual test IDs for surgical precision. Most of the time they'll probably skip whole test cases, but having the granularity for edge cases is essential.\nSo yes, I strongly vote for doing both test case and individual test IDs.\n**Question 2: Naming Convention**\nI'm fully aligned with your suggestion to use keyword-based slugs like enum-simple-validation rather than including the filename.\n**Question 3: Why Slugs?**\nI think slugs are the right choice despite the description-change risk. Here's my reasoning:\nThe big part of this feature is so implementers can reliably skip specific tests and track them over time. When someone looks at their skip list and sees enum-heterogeneous-validation/objects-are-deep-compared, they immediately understand what they're skipping.\nRegarding the concern about test descriptions being wrong - I think that's exactly why giving tests their own IDs is important. The probability of getting the description wrong for both the test case AND the individual test is very low, making this a highly advantageous trade-off.\nAnd even if we do occasionally need to change an ID because a description was incorrect, that's an acceptable cost. It would be a documented breaking change that implementers need to know about anyway.\nThe flexibility and usability that readable slugs provide outweigh the maintenance burden of occasionally updating them when descriptions are genuinely wrong.\n**Next Steps**\nI can write a script for updating existing tests with IDs. However, I'm still a little confused about what changes should and shouldn't affect the ID, and I'm still figuring out the GitHub Actions implementation because I'm still new to this section of GitHub.\n**Would appreciate guidance on:**\n1. Clear rules for when IDs must change vs when they can stay the same\n2. GitHub Actions setup for validation" ],

But on a privacy-preserving blockchain like Neptune Cash, the best you can do is point to some string of cryptographic data that lives there. And since it is privacy-preserving, that data is by design equivalent to gibberish without the right context. So it can't possibly be used as evidence to resolve a payment dispute. What we need is a way to generate a zero knowledge proof saying \"I initiated the transaction correctly; if you didn't receive the funds it's because you gave me the wrong address or screwed up in some other way\".\n\nIn the abstract, proof-of-payment is an important feature of money and the reason why we have receipts. The thing it resolves is payment disputes. I guess disputes *might* be resolved through some other technology, but a proof-of-payment seems pretty surgical.\n\nOne notes that both Monero [1] and ZCash [2] have proofs-of-payment. ZCash's version does not seem to be zero-knowledge.\n\n[1]: https://flashift.app/blog/monero-transaction-proof/\n[2]: https://github.com/zcash/zcash/blob/master/doc/payment-disclosure.md\n",

However, make no mistake: this task is not easy.\n\nIf you decide to accept the challenge, here are some pointers that might help you get started:\n\n - The user will want to activate this functionality from the dashboard, from the CLI, or from some other user interface that does not exist yet. Either way, it needs to be funneled through a set of RPC calls.\n - You want to generate a zk-STARK that a given output (`AdditionRecord`) in a given block corresponds to a UTXO (`Utxo`) containing the given payload (e.g., amount of `NativeCurrency`) and locked under the lock script (`LockScript`) hash stipulated by the address (`ReceivingAddress`).\n - The bulk of the work is figuring out how these buzzwords interrelate. Once you've got that figured out, you will need to write a (relatively small) tasm program that achieves the above bullet point. Take a look at the examples where the macros `triton_asm!` or `triton_program!` are used in the code base, or choose a snippet in [tasm-lib](https://github.com/TritonVM/tasm-lib) to pattern match off of.\n - Don't forget the verifier! There should obviously be a parallel RPC interface for verifying proofs-of-payment. The verifier has access to the same program and same claim info, but reads a STARK proof rather than the client's wallet state.", "May I work on this task?", "Absolutely!", "I've reviewed how Monero generates and verifies payment proofs, and I believe its approach is a better fit for Neptune compared to Zcash's verification method.\n\nI plan to implement this through three separate PRs:\n- Proof generation and verification (core functionality : in `models/blockchain/transaction/mod.rs` or maybe create here a `payement_proof.rs`)\n- Adding proof generation to the RPC (integration) : in `rpc_server.rs`\n- Adding proof generation and verification to neptune-cli and neptune-dashboard (UI/UX)\n\nLet me know your thoughts???I???d appreciate any feedback before proceeding.", "@elielnfinic  Please have a careful look at #510 and #513 before you begin any work.\n\nIn particular:\n* #510 proposes new RPC (and RUST) APIs for tx initiation, and #513 implements them, in a new module.

It might give you a better idea how best to integrate these new APIs.  if not interested, that's fine.", "Sure, no problem. I am okay with that.", "> I've reviewed how Monero generates and verifies payment proofs, and I believe its approach is a better fit for Neptune compared to Zcash's verification method.\n\nWould you mind summarizing the key points in your review and how you came to this conclusion? I did a (probably too) superficial search and found a [user guide](https://www.getmonero.org/resources/user-guides/prove-payment.html) for Monero's proof of payment (but not explanation about what's going on under the hood) and no results on how ZCash does it.", "While examining both systems, I noticed that Monero is more similar to Neptune Cash than Zcash. This is because Zcash allows transparent or semi-transparent transactions (e.g., from a transparent address to either a transparent or shielded address). The similarity to Neptune Cash arises when a shielded address sends funds to another shielded address([ZIP-0311](https://zips.z.cash/zip-0311#motivation)).   In Neptune Cash, all transactions are private as in Monero.\n\nIn contrast, Monero uses  a transaction key???a private key known only by the sender???to prove payments https://www.getmonero.org/resources/user-guides/prove-payment.html & https://www.getmonero.org/resources/user-guides/monero-wallet-cli.html. It is probable that JoinSplit is the key here to understand that private value allowing to prove but I am not sure since from [this point of view](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/is-my-understanding-of-how-zcash-works-correct/961/15) it appears to be different. \n\nThe solution is not simply to reject Zcash???s methodology in favor of Monero???s, but rather to find a hybrid approach that works best for us. I appreciate the simplicity of Zcash???s inputs for generating payment proofs in shielded transactions, but we should also consider Monero???s seamless transaction key system.  \n\nMy suggestion is to generate transaction keys by default or simply use the AdditionRecord digest that I believe, is similar to Monero key since it will reduce the key management overhead. The values in `UtxoRecoveryData` struct can help to construct a payment proof. We can generate a Triton STARK proof that a certain `AdditionRecord` is the result of a `Utxo` of a an amount of `NativeCurrency` for a certain `ReceivingAddress`(as [you suggested](https://github.com/Neptune-Crypto/neptune-core/issues/505#issuecomment-2726943191)). This means, supposing we already have a Digest generated from `Utxo`, `NativeCurrency` amount and `ReceivingAddress`, we can compare it to the AdditionRecord Digest in a Triton program and get a proof. Maybe comparison is not the best way to generate the proof, we can compute the hash and check if the output is related to the AdditionRecord digest.\n\nTo end, I have a question regarding \"sender_randomness\" in `IncomingUtxoRecoveryData`, if we decide its values : does the Receiver verifies the transaction since the transaction does not contain sender address : Is Receiver able to compute `Sender_randomness` or should Sender, also send it?", "Thanks for the research and the elaboration.\n\nI agree with the general approach, to use Triton VM to prove stuff about the preimages to the `AdditionRecord`.\n\n> To end, I have a question regarding \"sender_randomness\" in IncomingUtxoRecoveryData, if we decide its values : does the Receiver verifies the transaction since the transaction does not contain sender address : Is Receiver able to compute Sender_randomness or should Sender, also send it?\n\nThis is the million dollar question! Because the answer starts with \"depends\".\n\nIt depends on whether the UTXO notification was transmitted on-chain or off-chain.\n\n - *On-chain UTXO notification:* The transaction's `public_notifications` field contains a ciphertext that only the intended recipient can decrypt. When decrypted, this ciphertext yields the `Utxo` and the `sender_randomness`.\n - *Off-chain UTXO notification:* The sender transfers the `Utxo` and `sender_randomness` over some alternative channel, *not* the blockchain. As a result, proof-of-payment in this scenario is impossible and we should instead think in terms of proof of receipt.\n\nSo in summary, the answer is that in the scenario where proof-of-payment makes sense, the sender sends the `sender_randomness` to the receiver along with the `Utxo`.\n\nOne more thing: You zeroed in on `IncomingUtxoRecoveryData` quite correctly but you should know that the sender generally does not know the `receiver_preimage`. Furthermore, while the sender can produce `aocl_index`, it takes a nontrivial amount of work to obtain this information as he needs to process the block in which the transaction was confirmed.", "Btw, I think `sender` address or identification is not important since I don't think payment sender will claim a transaction. I believe the complaint will only come from `receiver`. So, I think `sender_randomness` or anything related to sender is no more important.\nI think we can use the `AdditionRecord digest + ReceivingAddress + Amount` to generate a new digest that can be used by `receiver` to verify payment : `PaymentProofDigest = hash(Utxo digest + ReceivingAddress + Amount)`.  \nWhen receiver has `Transaction ID`, `ReceivingAddress`(that he obviously has), `Amount` + `Proof`, they should be able to verify the payment.\nSo, if a digest can be this proof, do you think we need a STARK proof for this or a Digest is sufficient?", "I'm not sure I follow.\n\nWalk me through an example. Receiver says, \"I asked you to pay X bucks to address Y, but I never received it! I am going to sue you in court so I can get my compensation.\" Sender replies, \"I sent X bucks to address Y and here is the proof. The judge can verify it so feel free to sue me; but so can you so you know already that suing is pointless.\" Obviously, X and Y are parameters to the proof, without which it would be tricky to verify it. Furthermore, it may be assumed that sender and receiver agree on the canonical view of the blockchain. In order for the payment to have happened there, there must be some data on the blockchain that is also a parameter to the proof, even if it is only the tip hash.\n\nHow does the scheme you propose fit this example?\n\nI do not think you can ignore the `sender_randomness`. Without it, the receiver/verifier cannot reproduce the `AdditionRecord` and without the `AdditionRecord` the UTXO in question might never have been confirmed in the first place. Phrased differently, to prove that a transaction took place means to prove that a specific `AdditionRecord` was confirmed by some block on the canonical chain. The sender/prover must somehow relate that `AdditionRecord` to the disputed payment claim, and proving preimage knowledge of the `AdditionRecord` seems like a necessary first step (although not a sufficient one). You could make the proof *zero-knowledge* over the `sender_randomness` and even the `AdditionRecord` for that matter. Then you get an undisputable proof of payment that third parties cannot use to deanonymize.\n\nThe receiver/verifier cannot be assumed to know the original transaction kernel ID or even the raw transaction or even the UTXO; even if the receiver/verifier does have this information he can claim (falsely) that he never received it.\n\nLikewise, the receiver/verifier may have generated 100 different receiving addresses. He cannot be assumed to know which one was the one to receive the funds. Even if he did know, he could *claim* ignorance. What we are looking for is proof material that makes this claim untenable from the perspective of a third party judge.\n\nCan we have proof-of-payment without STARKs? In principle we can! And it's probably a good stepping stone. But the reason why you might want it to be a STARK is because you get the zero-knowledge part for free (at least if you use Triton VM). And that's what you need if you want the proof to be compelling without leaking sensitive information.\n\n", "\nI recently explored an off-chain UTXO verification mechanism and implemented a prototype. The core logic is as follows:  \n\n1. **Data from Payer**:  \n   - The payer must provide `sender_randomness` (generated via `Tip5::hash_varlen`), a random value used during transaction construction, and the **block height** after the transaction is confirmed on-chain.  \n\n2. **Verification by Receiver**:  \n   - The receiver calculates `utxo_index` by hashing `sender_randomness`, their own address, and the transaction amount.  \n   - The receiver checks if this `utxo_index` exists on-chain and whether its block height matches the payer???s claim. If both conditions hold, the payment is verified.  \n\n**Security Note**:  \n- `sender_randomness` is generated using `Tip5::hash_varlen`, a collision-resistant hash function. While no issues are currently identified, team review is required to confirm its implementation security.  \n\n**Test Code**:  \n```rust\nasync fn test_code(\n    receiving_address: ReceivingAddress,  // Receiver's address  \n    amount: NativeCurrencyAmount,         // Transfer amount  \n    sender_randomness: Digest,             // Randomness provided by payer  \n) {\n    let network = Network::Main;  // Mainnet configuration  \n\n    // Generate receiver's privacy digest and notification method  \n    let receiver_digest = receiving_address.privacy_digest();  \n    let notification_method = UtxoNotifyMethod::OnChain(receiving_address.clone());  \n\n    // Create a UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output)  \n    let utxo = Utxo::new_native_currency(receiving_address.lock_script(), amount);  \n\n    // Build transaction output  \n    let output = TxOutput {  \n        utxo,  \n        sender_randomness,  \n        receiver_digest,  \n        notification_method,  \n        owned: false,  \n        is_change: false,  \n    };  \n\n    // Serialize and print the commitment  \n    let ss: AdditionRecord = (&output).into();  \n    println!(\"output: {}\", ss.canonical_commitment.to_hex());  \n}  \n```  ", "Hi @kaola526, thanks for the suggestion.\n\nI think the intuition behind your suggestion is sound. Well done! Let's see if I can summarize it accurately.\n\nThe claim revolves around\n - a receiving address, and\n - an amount of native currency.\n\nThe proof consists of\n - the sender randomness, and (optionally)\n - the block height or AOCL index\n\nThe external verifier does:\n - compute the addition record from\n   - the item (hash of native currency UTXO)\n   - the sender randomness (supplied as proof)\n   - receiver digest (part of address)\n - check that the computed addition record lives in the indicated block or at the indicated index in the AOCL.\n\nIn order to break soundness, the malicious prover must find some other sender randomness such that the addition record computed from the fixed arguments and that sender randomness gives an addition record that lives in the AOCL. This is a multi-target second-preimage attack, which Tip5 is assumed to be secure against.\n\nIn fact, the malicious prover who succeeds in the above task does more than break soundness of the proof-of-payment system. The receiver who sees the (forged) proof can now take ownership of and spend the money! So expressed more succinctly expressed than above: the soundness of this proof-of-payment protocol reduces to the soundness of the monetary system.\n\nWith all of the above said, it should be noted that this protocol is **not** zero-knowledge and exposes the privacy of the receiver. If you want a zero-knowledge proof-of-payment system, then you need to use the VM to prove the correct execution of a program as described a few posts higher.", "Thank you for your response. Yes, this is an off-chain verification mechanism. When the recipient claims non-receipt of payment, both parties can use this method for resolution. Under normal circumstances, the sender only needs to disclose sender_randomness.\"" ],

How can they lead to issues? \nMy understanding is that a `type_info` object for a polymorphic `class X` is created in each translation unit that contains `class X`. Then the linker combines the equivalent `type_info` objects. Also, classes can???t be redefined in the same translation unit since header files have include guards. Thus a program is well-formed (i.e. builds successfully) in both cases. ", "> ... then the linker combines the equivalent type_info objects ...\n\nNot necessarily.  If there are multiple `*.so` files that all contain the `type_info` (e.g., in our Python bindings), they might not be combined.  That's why we aim to emit just one copy of the `type_info`, so its uniqueness is guaranteed. We build with `--copt=-fno-assume-unique-vtables` to help avoid that trap, but not everyone does.\n\nIt's also simply wasteful to emit the vtable (and all of the virtual methods!) into every translation unit, and then let the linker throw away most of them.  Like all other inline methods, the multiple emitted copies bloats the build.

Could be as little as a brighter icon colour or a bright, small leaf/flower symbol next to the icon 'head' (see quick sketches below).\n\n**Potential benefits:**\n- Many users treat newcomers with expectations of knowing the client as well as the game rules and mechanics inside out. Many newcomers however do not know one or more of those things and might be happy about people helping them along with the easy-to-spot quality of not using the client for long yet.\n- This might also potentially lead to less aggressive behaviour towards beginners in terms of forgiveness of mistakes on the side of users if knowing someone is actually new to the platform and/or game itself.\n- For moderative purposes it would be decidedly easier to both spot newcomer questions as such, actual newcomers, and treat violations of the TOS with less or more rigour accordingly.\n\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8e1e751-27a4-494a-ade7-cb268b5c6984) ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3bb9a7c-174e-4cff-a53a-0437e115f022)",

If our account is out of funds to pay for gas however, retrying isn't going to do anything and we should return to the user. \n\nI'm not sure tbh how the TxClient handles this as is, but ideally we should reuse that logic as much as possible.

For that we have :write, which is already present and working well in Zed. Instead, in regular helix, ctrl-s serves the purpose of saving that selection to the jump-list, that we can walk through forwards or backwards using ctrl-i and ctrl-o.\n\nZed already supports jumplists, so all that is left is to re-bind ctrl-s to to that instead. \n\nZed's jumplist system does not seem to work with selections as it is, but that is ok. We should focus on getting a basic version of this working, and cater to the selection aspect of the helix's jumplist in a separate issue following this one.\n\n### Steps to reproduce:\npress ctrl-s on zed, on helix mode, with a file open\n\n### Expected Behavior:\nPressing Ctrl+S saves the current cursor position to the jumplist, allowing the user to navigate back to this position using Ctrl+O (backward) and Ctrl+I (forward), consistent with regular Helix's behavior.\n\n### Actual Behavior:\nPressing Ctrl+S saves the file instead of saving the position to the jumplist, which is the default Zed behavior rather than the expected Helix mode behavior.\n\n### Future Expected Behavior:\nAfter this issue is completed, we can focus on not only saving the cursor position, to the jumplist, but also the selection. As in true helix.\n\n\n### Zed Version and System Specs\n\nZed: v0.210.4 (Zed) \nOS: Linux Wayland pop 24.04\nMemory: 31.1 GiB\nArchitecture: x86_64\nGPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 6GB Laptop GPU || NVIDIA || 580.82.09\n\n### Relevant PRs\n- https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/pull/33495",

Alias Deprecation Period: Consider keeping temporary aliases with deprecation warnings to give existing users time to migrate\n2. Go Doc Improvements: Enhance package-level documentation in both clients with clear examples of when to use each\n3.

      "description" : "## **Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\n\nWhen working with high-dimensional datasets, computing C2ST (and particularly L-C2ST) metrics can be quite slow. This is primarily due to the reliance on scikit-learn (`sklearn`) classifiers, which do not support GPU acceleration. As a result, performance is limited, especially for large datasets or complex models.\n\n## **Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nIntroducing support for classifiers from GPU-compatible libraries, such as `skorch`, would significantly improve performance. By leveraging GPU acceleration, training and evaluation of classifiers for C2ST metrics could become substantially faster, enhancing both development and experimentation workflows.\n\n## **Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\nCurrently, no viable alternatives are available since the limitation stems from the lack of GPU support in `sklearn`. Expanding support to include GPU-compatible libraries appears to be the most effective solution.\n\n## **Additional context**\n\n- [ ] Would require adding another library as a dependency. Need to check if this might conflict with our current dependencies.\n- [ ] Adapt current implementation [here](https://github.com/sbi-dev/sbi/blob/main/sbi/diagnostics/lc2st.py)\n- [ ] Think about similar accelerate similar metrics i.e. [here](https://github.com/sbi-dev/sbi/blob/main/sbi/utils/metrics.py)\n",

      "comments" : [ "Hey @JuliaLinhart , I would love to try to solve this issue .While exploring ways to implement GPU support via skorch, I noticed that skorch only wraps PyTorch neural networks and cannot replace tree-based classifiers. Since C2ST uses Random Forests but L-C2ST uses MLPs, skorch can be applied to L-C2ST but not directly to C2ST.\n\nCould you please advise on how you would like me to proceed?", "Hello! That's amazing, thanks for the initiative! \n\n1. I???d apply `skorch` to L-C2ST or MLP-based C2ST to enable GPU acceleration \n\n2. For RF-based C2ST, we have a few options:\n\n- Keep using CPU-based Random Forests from `sklearn` and consider Intel acceleration [`scikit-learn-intelex`](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/scikit-learn.html)\n- Try a GPU-compatible alternative, such as `RAPIDS cuML RandomForestClassifier`\n or [XGBoost with `gpu_hist`](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/gpu/index.html), both offering significant speedups on large datasets.\n\nIn any case we have to think about how adding those changes would affect the API (conflict with current dependencies, userfriendly, etc...). We would have to check with @janfb what he thinks would be best. ", "Great that you tackle this @Dev-Sudarshan ! \n\nI agree with @JuliaLinhart , we can just focus on MLP-based C2ST for the GPU support for L-C2ST. \n\nThe different C2ST options are independent of L-C2ST in principle, and we could just issue a user warning when someone tries to use L-C2ST with RF-based C2ST on the GPU. \n\nSo, I would recommend focusing on using `skorch` and supporting only the MLP-based C2ST, and keep the API changes minimal, e.g., just a flag which `device` and careful device handling similar to how we do it in the inference methods. \n\n@JuliaLinhart would you be up for guiding this? and I can do a high-level review later? ", "Yes sounds good!!", "I'm fairly new to this topic, so I initially sought help from chat-based models to understand the structure and requirements. After reviewing their suggestions and taking time to understand the logic myself, I believe the following changes are needed to enhance lc2st.py???especially for integrating GPU support and PyTorch compatibility. @JuliaLinhart Could you please review these before I move forward with implementation?\n\n1. Change in Code Dependencies \nImports: Add torch, torch.nn, and skorch.NeuralNetClassifier.\nUtilities: Define a simple get_device() function to determine if CUDA is available.\nModel: Define the PyTorchMLP class (nn.Module)???the actual network that will run on the GPU.\n\n2. LC2ST.__init__ Logic\nAdd device: str = 'cpu' to __init__ parameters.\nConditional Logic (for 'mlp'):\nIF device == 'cuda': Set self.clf_class to NeuralNetClassifier and configure self.clf_kwargs with PyTorch-specific params (module=PyTorchMLP, device='cuda', etc.).\nELSE (CPU Default): Set self.clf_class to MLPClassifier (standard sklearn).\n\n3. train_lc2st Function\nData Type Fix: Change label creation to explicitly use dtype=np.int64 (long integers). This is required for PyTorch/skorch classification.\n\n", "Yes, so if I understand correctly (I havn't used skorch before either...) you need a PyTorch `nn.Module` to wrap the `skorch.NeuralNetClassifier` around, like this as mentioned [here](https://skorch.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/quickstart.html):\n\n```\nclass MyModule(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, num_units=10, nonlin=nn.ReLU()):\n        super().__init__()\n\n        self.dense0 = nn.Linear(20, num_units)\n        self.nonlin = nonlin\n        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.5)\n        self.dense1 = nn.Linear(num_units, num_units)\n        self.output = nn.Linear(num_units, 2)\n\n    def forward(self, X, **kwargs):\n        X = self.nonlin(self.dense0(X))\n        X = self.dropout(X)\n        X = self.nonlin(self.dense1(X))\n        X = self.output(X)\n        return X\n\n\nnet = NeuralNetClassifier(\n    MyModule,\n    max_epochs=10,\n    criterion=nn.CrossEntropyLoss(),\n    lr=0.1,\n    # Shuffle training data on each epoch\n    iterator_train__shuffle=True,\n)\n```\n\nThen I guess all you are saying should be true. \n\nI suggest you try it on your end: fork the repo, implement your changes, run pytests. On that note, you might need to change the existing pytests and/or add some new ones to check for device compatibility etc. (cf what janbf mentioned related to what we do in the inference methods). \n\nAlso try to think of appropriate user warnings like this one janbf mentioned:\n\"The different C2ST options are independent of L-C2ST in principle, and we could just issue a user warning when someone tries to use L-C2ST with RF-based C2ST on the GPU.\"", "Hi @JuliaLinhart ,\nI???ve been implementing the GPU support for L-C2ST. I noticed a potential parameter handling issue in LC2ST.__init__:\n\nThe default classifier_kwargs (for the CPU MLPClassifier), including the scaled hidden_layer_sizes and training settings, are currently only set if classifier_kwargs is None.\n\nIf a user provides custom classifier_kwargs (e.g., to override one parameter like max_iter), all other essential sbi default parameters are skipped. This forces the classifier to use standard scikit-learn defaults, which are different and potentially less suitable for SBI (e.g., smaller fixed network size, fewer training iterations).\n\nBefore I add logic to merge the user's classifier_kwargs with our SBI defaults, could you confirm if this parameter merging is already being handled in a higher-level wrapper function that calls LC2ST?" ],

Hopefully I've understood correctly to have the same issue as OP is pointing out\n\n**Previous** behavior under the \"Save to...\" menu:\n\n- User can click to toggle inclusion of the video on to one of any of their playlists (including the special playlist Watch Later). The menu stays open and the user can continue to scroll and toggle playlists at their leisure\n- Playlist names only feature their title, and therefore take up a little less space\n\n**New**, current behavior under the \"Save to...\" menu:\n\n- Clicking to toggle the inclusion of the video on to any playlist, now also causes the menu to close. Meaning user has to reopen the menu. Where the scroll jump point has now also reset, so user must also rescroll back to wherever they were searching at prior\n- Playlist names are also now accompanied by the visibility of the playlist (private/untitled/public), as well as the playlist's thumbnail. This results in each entry taking up much more space, in what is already quite a small and cramped menu for anyone with enough playlists\n\nThe automatic closure of the dialogue, is certainly the priority issue\nBut there's always been a number of small QOL adjustments that could also be made to this menu, to make it much more responsive for basically the same use-case. That is; having a large number of playlists\nThis might include: ability to resize the dialogue, ability to turn off thumbnails or otherwise make the entries smaller in size, retaining scroll position between open/close of the dialogue\n\nThere is also the potential to add search or order-by functions, to the Save menu playlist list.

      "description" : "**Context**  \n\nWe currently have inconsistent logging patterns across the codebase:\n- Some modules use logging.getLogger(__name__) which creates long, unreadable logger names\n- HITL components use both standard logging AND a separate log_hitl() function, creating duplicate logs\n- The hitl_logger.py file creates a separate debug log that could be handled by standard log levels\n- No centralized way to configure or initialize loggers consistently\n\nThis makes logs harder to read, manage and filter. We need to standardize on a single approach.\n\n**Proposed Approach**\n\nCreate a logger factory that uses component-based naming (e.g., HITL.FeedbackManager instead of\nsrc.modules.handlers.hitl.feedback_manager) to balance readability with the ability to filter logs by component.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria**\n\n1. Logger Factory Created\n\n- New file src/modules/config/logger_factory.py exists\n- Exports a get_logger(component_name: str) function that returns a configured logger\n- Logger includes formatting with: component name, timestamp, log level, thread info\n- Function integrates with the existing TeeOutput system from environment.py\n- Supports configuring log levels per component (e.g., set HITL to DEBUG, others to INFO)\n-  Log files should continue to be cyber_operations.log\n\n2. Environment Configuration Updated\n\n- environment.py imports and uses the logger factory\n- setup_logging() function initializes the logger factory configuration\n- Ensure the logger factory works with the existing setup_logging() initialization\n- TeeOutput system remains unchanged (it works well)\n\n3. Other changes\n\n- HITL modules migrated to the new setup\n- all other modules standardized - replace logging.getLogger(__name__) with get_logger(\"Component.Subcomponent\") and use consistent component naming (e.g. Agents.* for agent modules and Tools.* for tool modules etc)\n\n**Documentation & Validation**\n\n- Logging standards documented (either in README or comments in logger_factory.py)\n- Explains when to use DEBUG vs INFO vs WARNING levels\n- Shows example of how to use get_logger() in new modules\n\n**Component Naming Convention**\n\nUse hierarchical component names:\n- CyberAutoAgent - Main application\n- HITL.FeedbackManager, HITL.FeedbackHandler, etc.\n- Evaluation.Manager, Evaluation.TraceParser, etc.\n- Tools.Memory, Tools.ReportBuilder, etc.\n- Agents.CyberAutoAgent, Agents.ReportAgent, etc.\n- Config.Manager, Config.Environment, etc.\n- Handlers.ReactBridge, Handlers.ReportGenerator, etc.\n\n**Example Usage**\n\nOld pattern (inconsistent)\n\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)  # Creates \"src.modules.handlers.hitl.feedback_manager\"\nlog_hitl(\"FeedbackManager\", \"Processing feedback\", \"DEBUG\")\n\nNew pattern (standardized)\n\nfrom src.modules.config.logger_factory import get_logger\n\nlogger = get_logger(\"HITL.FeedbackManager\")\nlogger.debug(\"Processing feedback\", extra={\"context_key\": \"value\"})\nlogger.info(\"Feedback accepted\")\n",

Logging standardization completed successfully!\n\n### Summary\nSuccessfully implemented centralized logging with component-based naming across the entire Cyber-AutoAgent codebase.\n\n### What was done\n1. **Created logger_factory.py** (`src/modules/config/logger_factory.py`)\n   - Centralized `get_logger(component_name)` function\n   - Component-based naming system (e.g., `Agents.CyberAutoAgent`, `Tools.Memory`)\n   - Support for component-specific log levels\n   - Thread-safe logger registry\n   - Comprehensive documentation with usage examples\n\n2. **Integrated with environment.py**\n   - Called `initialize_logger_factory()` from `setup_logging()`\n   - Enhanced formatter to include component name and thread info\n   - Maintains compatibility with existing TeeOutput system\n   - Log files continue to use `cyber_operations.log`\n\n3. **Migrated 18 modules** to standardized logging:\n   - **Agents**: `cyber_autoagent.py` ??? `Agents.CyberAutoAgent`, `report_agent.py` ??? `Agents.ReportAgent`\n   - **Config**: `environment.py` ??? `Config.Environment`, `manager.py` ??? `Config.Manager`\n   - **Tools**: `memory.py` ??? `Tools.Memory`, `prompt_optimizer.py` ??? `Tools.PromptOptimizer`, `report_builder.py` ??? `Tools.ReportBuilder`\n   - **Handlers**: `prompt_rebuild_hook.py` ??? `Handlers.PromptRebuildHook`, `report_generator.py` ??? `Handlers.ReportGenerator`, `react_bridge_handler.py` ??? `Handlers.ReactBridge`, `hooks.py` ??? `Handlers.ReactHooks`\n   - **Evaluation**: `evaluation.py` ??? `Evaluation.Evaluation`, `manager.py` ??? `Evaluation.Manager`, `trace_parser.py` ??? `Evaluation.TraceParser`\n   - **Prompts**: `factory.py` ??? `Prompts.Factory`\n   - **Tests**: Updated mocks in `test_output_display_integration.py`\n\n4. **Documentation included**\n   - Comprehensive docstring in `logger_factory.py`\n   - Component naming conventions documented\n   - Log level usage guidelines (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)\n   - Usage examples showing old vs new patterns\n\n5. **Testing**\n   - ??? All 248 tests passing\n   - No regressions introduced\n   - Test suite verified integration with existing code\n\n### Key Features\n- **Readable component names**: `HITL.FeedbackManager` instead of `src.modules.handlers.hitl.feedback_manager`\n- **Hierarchical filtering**: Set log level for entire component families (e.g., `HITL.*` or `Tools.*`)\n- **Enhanced formatting**: Includes component name, timestamp, log level, and thread info\n- **Thread-safe**: Logger registry protected with locks\n- **Backward compatible**: Integrates seamlessly with existing TeeOutput system\n\n### Example Usage\n```python\n# Old pattern (inconsistent)\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)  # Creates long module path\nlogger.info(\"Processing feedback\")\n\n# New pattern (standardized)\nfrom modules.config.logger_factory import get_logger\n\nlogger = get_logger(\"HITL.FeedbackManager\")\nlogger.debug(\"Processing feedback\", extra={\"request_id\": \"12345\"})\nlogger.info(\"Feedback accepted\", extra={\"user\": \"analyst1\"})\n```\n\n\n\n---\n\n[Branch: claude/issue-80-20251105-0555](https://github.com/westonbrown/Cyber-AutoAgent/tree/claude/issue-80-20251105-0555) |", "Implemented simplified logger factory in PR #88 - reduced from 244 to 52 lines while keeping all benefits.

If you would like to work on this issue, your first steps are:\n\n1. Check that no other contributor is working on this issue. If someone is assigned to the issue or claimed to be working on it, ping the person. After one week without a response, the assignee may be changed.\n1. Leave a comment indicating that you are working on the issue, or just create a [pull request](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pulls) after following the steps below. [Mention](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) this issue in the description of the pull request.\n1. Fix the issue locally.\n1. [Run the test suite](https://llvm.org/docs/TestingGuide.html#unit-and-regression-tests) locally. Remember that the subdirectories under `test/` create fine-grained testing targets, so you can e.g. use `make check-clang-ast` to only run Clang's AST tests.\n1. Create a Git commit.\n1. Run [`git clang-format HEAD~1`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html#git-integration) to format your changes.\n1. Open a [pull request](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pulls) to the [upstream repository](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project) on GitHub. Detailed instructions can be found [in GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

Review the file to identify sections of code that are being ignored by Codecov or are not covered by tests.\n2. Create or update test cases to ensure 100% coverage for the file.\n3. Remove any `/* istanbul ignore */` or equivalent statements that bypass code coverage reporting, unless absolutely necessary.\n# Resources\n- Refer to the foundational documentation on writing test cases in the repository.\n- Check the [Codecov report](https://app.codecov.io/gh/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa-api/tree/develop-postgres/src?displayType=list) for details on the uncovered lines.\n# Acceptance Criteria\n- All sections of the file are covered by tests.\n- Code coverage for the file reaches 100%.\n- PR created with necessary updates, passing all checks and reviews.\n\n### Parent issue\nhttps://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa-api/issues/2920\n\n**Potential internship candidates**\nPlease read this if you are planning to apply for a Palisadoes Foundation internship \n- https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa/issues/359\n",

In principle, most of the settings should probably already be saved through Android's backup mechanism, but that works only on devices that have implemented it (i.e. mainly those with Google services) and sometimes you want to transfer settings manually.

Thanks!", "One thing we should probably improve if we're going to be using this component more widely is the a11y of the component. For example, you cannot open the dropdown with the keyboard at the moment.", "@sfc-gh-nbellante \n\njust to confirm my understanding:\n\nThe original issue around updating the dropdown visuals appears to be mostly a CSS / styling change (matching the new top-nav dropdown style).\n\nThe a11y improvement you mentioned ??? like enabling opening the dropdown via keyboard ??? would likely involve logic changes at the component or backend interaction level, beyond just styling.\n\nSince I'm just starting out, would it make sense for me to first focus on the styling update as the base fix, and then create a follow-up issue or PR for the keyboard-accessibility enhancement?\nOr would you prefer both to be handled together within the same PR?", "Hey @rishi-kumar0612! \n\nI want to clarify the scope of this issue, as it's actually more involved than it might initially appear.\n\n**What needs to be done**\n\n  The goal is to update the dropdown menus used by several widgets to match the visual style of the new top navigation dropdown. The widgets that need updating include:\n\n  - st.selectbox - https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/develop/frontend/lib/src/components/shared/Dropdown/Selectbox.tsx\n  - st.multiselect - https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/develop/frontend/lib/src/components/widgets/Multiselect/Multiselect.tsx\n  - st.time_input - https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/develop/frontend/lib/src/components/widgets/TimeInput/TimeInput.tsx\n  - st.dataframe column filters (uses the shared Dropdown component)\n  - App menu dropdowns\n\n  **The target style**\n\n  The new dropdown style you want to match is implemented in the top navigation's dropdown menu:\n  - TopNavSection component:\n  https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/develop/frontend/app/src/components/Navigation/TopNavSection.tsx#L77-L193\n  - Styled components:\n  https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/develop/frontend/app/src/components/Navigation/styled-components.ts#L323-L330\n\nNote that the top nav dropdown uses BaseWeb's Popover component (lines 77-193) with custom styling overrides, including the rounded corners (theme.radii.xl), specific shadows, and borders.\n\n  **Why this is more than just CSS**\n\nThe current widgets use BaseWeb's Select component, which has its own dropdown implementation. To match the top nav style, you'll likely need to override the Dropdown component prop in the Select's overrides (similar to how VirtualDropdown is used at https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/develop/frontend/lib/src/components/shared/Dropdown/Selectbox.tsx#L174) and apply the new styling to match the StyledPopoverContent from the top nav.\n\nThe key styling changes to replicate are:\n  - Border radius: theme.radii.xl (all corners)\n  - Box shadow: conditional based on light/dark theme\n  - Border styling: consistent 1px solid borders\n  - Padding: theme.spacing.twoXS vertical, 0 horizontal\n  - Margins: specific top/right spacing\n\n**About my earlier a11y comment**\n\nAfter thinking through the implementation more carefully, I realize my earlier comment about keyboard accessibility isn't actually relevant to this issue. The widgets you'd be updating (st.selectbox, st.multiselect, etc.) already have proper keyboard support through BaseWeb's Select component, and updating the visual styling won't affect that. So you can disregard that concern???it's not applicable here.\n\n**Recommendation**\n\nGiven that this involves:\n  1. Updating multiple widget components across the codebase\n  2. Understanding BaseWeb's override system and Emotion styling\n  3. Creating custom dropdown components or overrides\n  4. Testing changes across all affected widgets\n\nThis is actually a moderate-to-advanced level contribution, not quite a \"good first issue\" in practice. However, if you're comfortable with React, TypeScript, and Emotion, it could be a great learning opportunity!\n\nI'd suggest starting with just st.selectbox as a proof of concept, then we can review that approach before rolling it out to the other widgets. This way you get feedback early and avoid having to rework multiple components.\n\nDoes this help clarify the scope? Let me know if you have questions about the approach!", "Hey @sfc-gh-nbellante !\n\nThanks so much for the detailed breakdown???this really helps clarify the scope.\n\nI understand this is more involved than a typical \"good first issue,\" but I'm comfortable with React, TypeScript, and Emotion, so I'm up for the challenge!\n\nYour suggestion to start with st.selectbox as a proof of concept makes perfect sense. I'll focus on that first and get it working before expanding to the other widgets.\n\nMy plan:\n\n- Study the TopNavSection.tsx and its styled components to understand the target style\n- Modify Selectbox.tsx (or VirtualDropdown) to match the new dropdown styling\n- Test thoroughly with a sample script\n- Open a draft PR for early feedback before rolling out to other widgets\n\nI'll start working on this and reach out if I hit any blockers. Should I ping you here when I have the st.selectbox proof of concept ready for review?\n\n\nThanks again for the guidance!" ],

      "comments" : [ "@chris7716 I did some digging & I found that majority of the `put()` calls made in the storage layer seem to occur when creating a new model instance. The only exception to this is the `put_multi_{model_name}()` methods in a few question storage models [here](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/blob/4def547d5425ff55f772ec2907885a7961ee330a/core/storage/question/gae_models.py#L298C1-L299). This tells me that most of the `put()` calls made in the service layer are to update existing model instances.\n\nAlso, I think the `created_on` & `last_updated` fields are missed because of missing `update_timestamps()` calls before the `put()` calls. If the two method calls are used together this often, it might be worth putting the 2 method calls into its own method in the storage layer. What do you think?\n", "Hi @Ash-2k3, thanks for proposing this as a good first issue. I am removing the label for now and looping in @DubeySandeep to approve the label.

It will be added back if approved. Thanks!", "@seanlip     I would like to work on this issue.\n\nAs noted in the description, calling UserContributionRightsModel.put() directly from the service layer (user_services.py) bypasses the BaseModel logic, which leads to inconsistent or missing timestamps for created_on and last_updated.\n\nMy proposed solution is to:\n\nCreate a new save_contribution_rights(cls, ...) @classmethod inside the UserContributionRightsModel in core/storage/user/gae_models.py.\n\nThis new storage-layer method will contain the \"upsert\" logic: it will get() the model, create a new one if it's None, update its properties, and then call model_instance.put().\n\nRefactor the _save_user_contribution_rights function in core/domain/user_services.py to call this new user_models.UserContributionRightsModel.save_contribution_rights() method.\n\nThis moves the database write logic to the storage layer, fixes the timestamp inconsistency, and address to Oppia's architecture.\n\nPlease assign this issue to me.", "@chris7716 PTAL, at @sujjethog-ops comment.  Thanks\n\n", "@masterboy376 can you please assign this to me", "@sujjethog-ops, your approach looks good to me. Assigning you the issue, please let us know when you can open a PR for this one.\nThanks!", "@masterboy376 created a pr please review\n\n\n", "@sujjethog-ops @masterboy376 @chris7716 I took a look at this issue and I'm a bit confused. We have a _pre_put_hook() in BaseModel that is supposed to update the timestamps. Is that not called?\n\nBefore tackling this issue, would it be possible to confirm (by performing actions that trigger the existing put() operation) that it definitely doesn't update the timestamps?", "@seanlip   You are right, the _pre_put_hook is supposed to handle the timestamps.\n\nThe problem was that the old code in user_services.py was calling the NDB put operation directly. This direct call bypasses Oppia's custom BaseModel.put() method (which is where the _pre_put_hook is triggered).\n\nThis PR fixes that by moving the logic into a new storage-layer method (save_contribution_rights in gae_models.py). This new method gets the model instance and then calls model_instance.put(). Because this is the instance method on our BaseModel, it correctly triggers the _pre_put_hook and sets the timestamps.\n\nThe new unit tests I've added in gae_models_test.py (test_save_contribution_rights_...) confirm this new behavior:\n\ntest_save_contribution_rights_creates_new_model... checks that created_on and last_updated are set on creation.\n\ntest_save_contribution_rights_updates_existing_model... checks that created_on is unchanged and last_updated is modified on update.\n\nThanks!", "In the old code, .put() is being called from UserContributionRightsModel which is a subclass of BaseModel. So I am not sure I understand your first paragraph.", "@sujjethog-ops Please stop giving AI-generated responses without working through and testing the code. This is a waste of reviewers' time. \n\nYou are responsible for the quality of the code investigations that you do. If your future responses cite facts that are obviously false then we will ask you not to contribute to this repository further.", "@seanlip    I 'm sorry \n \n   I have re-investigated the code  \n\nThe original issue was that user_services.py used datastore_services.put_multi(), which bypasses the BaseModel's _pre_put_hook and failed to update the timestamps.\n\n\nMy PR now correctly routes this through a new save_contribution_rights method in \"gae_models.py\" which uses model_instance.put()\n\n\n\nAs requested by @masterboy376, I have also added new unit tests to gae_models_test.py that specifically verify this new method works for both creating and updating models, and that the timestamps are set correctly.\n\n\n\nthanks!\n\n", "@seanlip @chris7716, according to my reasoning Since UserContributionRightsModel extends BaseModel, which contain pre put hooks to update dates, and UserContributionRightsModel does not implements its own put() function, therefore the dates should not be inconsistent here.\nI believe the issue is just about avoiding the use of GAE datastore function in the service layer, as a general code style choice. @chris7716, do you agree?", "@masterboy376 Thanks for clarifying. If that is the intent, then what do other files do? We should be consistent throughout the domain layer, not just this specific case.", "I guess this is where we started this discussion: I think this is why we created this issue: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aKYAxxPRR_JCWJ5qbqdah9eLjroGugpkARPt8ZiHF1M/edit?disco=AAAA2FM8hNU\n\nParticulary this comment:\n\n<img width=\"276\" height=\"180\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44724671-b819-4114-b272-3a63da6679dc\" />\n\nWhen calling the put() when updating a model, it seems we change both created_on and last_updated?", "This is how we usually do the update: https://github.com/oppia/oppia/blob/develop/core/domain/suggestion_services.py#L771-L777\n\nBut in some services, it looks we directly call put() when updating.", "Also see here: https://googleapis.dev/python/python-ndb/latest/model.html#google.cloud.ndb.model.DateTimeProperty._prepare_for_put\n\nMaybe if we do not set auto_now, last_updated is not automatically set when updating an entity?

This makes sense for dynamic, task-instance specific / DAG-run specific URLs (e.g. a link to an external Spark job); however, XComs are _not_ an ideal mechanism for static URLs which are only specific to the given operator (rather than the task instance). For example, a very common use case for the Extra Links feature is to point to a static, operator-specific documentation page. Yet, storing that URL in an XCom for each task instance is clearly not ideal in that circumstance, and only adds bloat to the metaDB.\n\n### Related issues\n\nOnly very tangentially related: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/54527\n\n### Are you willing to submit a PR?\n\n- [x] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\nCaveat: I am willing to help with the backend implementation, but I have no understanding or experience regarding react / frontend development.\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n",

Most of them seem straightforward - the annotation is present but the logger isn't actually used, so it can be simply removed.\n\nHowever, there's one file I'm a bit confused about:\n\n**File:** `src/test/java/io/kestra/plugin/gcp/bigquery/QueryTest.java`\n**Method:** `retry()`\n\nThe method structure is roughly:\n\n```java\n@Test\nvoid retry() throws Exception {\n    ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();\n    List<Callable<Query.Output>> tasks = new ArrayList<>();    \n    for (int i = 0; i < 50; i++) {\n        Query task = Query.builder()\n            // ... task configuration ...\n            .build();\n        \n        RunContext runContext = TestsUtils.mockRunContext(...);\n        tasks.add(() -> task.run(runContext));\n    }\n    \n    List<Future<Query.Output> futures = executorService.invokeAll(tasks);\n    \n    List<Query.Output> results = futures\n        .stream()\n        .map(outputFuture -> {\n            try {\n                return outputFuture.get();\n            } catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException e) {\n                log.error(\"Failed on \", e);  // ??? This logger usage\n                return null;\n            }\n        })\n        .filter(Objects::nonNull)\n        .toList();\n}\n```\nHere runContext is created in the loop scope hence isn't directly accessible in the lambda also\nMy understanding is that in this test, multiple `runContext` instances are created (one per loop iteration with different taskIds), so I wasn't sure if that's the right place for execution-level logging.\n\nShould I just remove the log statement, or is there a better approach you'd recommend?", "@KarthikReddyMaru, why not create the `runContext` outside of loop? that would solve it right?\ne.g `var runContext =  runConextFactory.of();`", "@Malaydewangan09, Got it. I'll create the runContext outside the loop and implement it that way. Thank you for the guidance!", "Hi @Malaydewangan09 \uD83D\uDC4B\uD83C\uDFFB,\n\nCould you please assign the plugin-gcp part of this issue to me?

We could have a map of nodes, the values of each could be a map of tasks (key is the sink function and value is the node-bound actual function instance).\n\nOtherwise, we could also have a set of `{node, task}` objects, which would be the keys, and then we'd walk the set to run everything we find in it\n\nBecause of \"locality\" I have a feeling like a map of nodes => map of tasks might be more efficient on the DOM, so you would run all tasks for a given node in one go before moving on to the next node, but only numbers could confirm this will actually be the case.\n\n\nUnless I've missed something, RenderingTask seems correct to be a SinkFunction. A Sink is a \"preloader\" of a SinkFunction. It runs when mounting a component, gets the node as a parameter and returns the sink function, bound to the node for performance if possible.\n\n\n\nAnyway, `Sink` and `SinkFunction` are a bit confusing in the naming... whenever two better names come up, I'm happy to improve them" ],

Centralized Environment Variable Access**\n- ??? Added `getenv()`, `getenv_bool()`, `getenv_int()`, `getenv_float()` methods to ConfigManager\n- ??? These methods provide type-safe access with automatic type conversion and error handling\n- ??? All 100+ environment variables now documented in `_ENV_VARS` registry with defaults\n\n**2. Fixed Caching Bug**\n- ??? Implemented environment change detection via `_has_env_changed()`\n- ??? Automatic cache invalidation when environment variables change\n- ??? No more stale configuration values returned\n\n**3. Removed Direct os.getenv() Calls**\n- ??? Replaced **70+ direct `os.getenv()` calls** across key files:\n  - `src/modules/config/manager.py` (55+ replacements)\n  - `src/modules/evaluation/evaluation.py` (15 replacements)\n  - `src/modules/agents/cyber_autoagent.py` (11 replacements)\n- ??? `src/modules/tools/memory.py` already using ConfigManager (no changes needed)\n\n**4. API Consolidation**\n- ??? Single accessor pattern: `config_manager.getenv(key, default)`\n- ??? Type-specific helpers: `getenv_bool()`, `getenv_int()`, `getenv_float()`\n- ??? Clear documentation on usage in method docstrings\n\n**5. Testing**\n- ??? **All 248 tests passing** - no regressions introduced\n- ??? Backward compatibility maintained\n\n#### Files Modified\n- `src/modules/config/manager.py` - Core refactoring with centralized accessor\n- `src/modules/evaluation/evaluation.py` - Now uses ConfigManager for all env access\n- `src/modules/agents/cyber_autoagent.py` - Now uses ConfigManager for all env access\n\n#### What Was Not Done\nThe acceptance criteria mentioned \"Extract larger config pieces into separate files for easier management.\" I focused on the core refactoring first - the consolidation and caching fixes. Extracting config into separate files could be a follow-up enhancement if desired.\n\nSome handler files in `src/modules/handlers/` still use direct `os.getenv()` calls, but these weren't mentioned in the acceptance criteria. The key business logic files (evaluation.py, cyber_autoagent.py, memory.py) have all been updated as requested.\n\n#### \n\n--- | [Branch: claude/issue-81-20251105-0557](https://github.com/westonbrown/Cyber-AutoAgent/tree/claude/issue-81-20251105-0557)", "@claude Please refactor ConfigManager as single source of truth for configuration.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Base on `release-0.1.4` branch\n- Remove scattered os.getenv() calls throughout codebase\n- Fix configuration caching bug (detect env changes, invalidate stale cache)\n- Centralize env var access through ConfigManager\n- Document supported environment variables\n- Run full test suite to ensure no regressions\n\nKeep implementation clean and maintainable.", "**Claude finished @westonbrown's task** ??????

I'm not sold on the naming of paramters.\r\nFor me the RegExp was sufficient, but perhaps a more generic: `discardKey: (key, line) => {}` could be considered",

By default, clang does not build ClangIR support. You can find instructions for building with ClangIR enabled [here](https://llvm.github.io/clangir/GettingStarted/build-install.html).\n\nSecond, after building but before starting any other work, you should verify that you see an error when compiling the suggested minimal test case with ClangIR enabled. You should see an error (in this case, ``) when you compile the test case using the following options: `-fclangir -emit-cir`. The error may be followed by other errors or a stack dump. If you do not see an error, either someone else has already implemented this feature, or you are using the wrong repository (perhaps you built the ClangIR incubator repository?).\n\nThird, the code to implement this feature is already present in the [ClangIR incubator repository](https://github.com/llvm/clangir). The task here is to find the correct code, migrate it to the main LLVM repository, and creating a pull request to merge it there. As part of the migration process, you may need to update the code to conform to the coding standards used in the LLVM project. You will also need to create or migrate a LIT test that exercises the new code.\n\nDon't hesitate to ask for help if you need it.

      "repositoryName" : "kubernetes/kubernetes",
      "description" : "Today we construct the request object for every http request for the http probes. This involves concatenating some strings, setting headers, etc.\r\n\r\nProbes are simple http get requests that are executed synchronously (for a single probe) and has no request body.\r\n\r\nThe optimization may be to reuse the request object for all probe executions. This likely save some cpu and memory for the kubelet process.\r\n\r\nSome code references:\r\n- [DoProbe](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/4dfd2fe74d96f67c9752bbdc9ae9983a6e5f0492/pkg/probe/http/http.go#L93) is executed today on each probe execution.\r\n- New request are [being created](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/4dfd2fe74d96f67c9752bbdc9ae9983a6e5f0492/pkg/kubelet/prober/prober.go#L146) for each execution.\r\n- New object will need to be stored in [worker](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/4dfd2fe74d96f67c9752bbdc9ae9983a6e5f0492/pkg/kubelet/prober/worker.go#L40) that for http probes will hold the http request object. This object will need to encapsulate the logic of [runProbe](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/4dfd2fe74d96f67c9752bbdc9ae9983a6e5f0492/pkg/kubelet/prober/prober.go#L138) method of the prober.\r\n\r\nI'm marking this issue as a good first issue, as the issue doesn't require deep knowledge of Kubernetes. However it is not an easy issue, a few parts of code will be affected and change needs to be done very carefully.\r\n\r\n***Please review code and make sure you understand the task before self-assigning the issue.***\r\n\r\nImplementation notes\r\n\r\n1. If you can send the small benchmark results on probes with and without this optimization, it will be a good starting point. Note, for the benchmark, each probe can run once a second, not more often.

This involves concatenating some strings, setting headers, etc.\r\n>\r\n>Probes are simple http get requests that are executed synchronously (for a single probe) and has no request body.\r\n>\r\n>The optimization may be to reuse the request object for all probe executions. This likely save some cpu and memory for the kubelet process.\r\n>\r\n>Some code references:\r\n>- [DoProbe](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/4dfd2fe74d96f67c9752bbdc9ae9983a6e5f0492/pkg/probe/http/http.go#L93) is executed today on each probe execution.\r\n>- New request are [being created](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/4dfd2fe74d96f67c9752bbdc9ae9983a6e5f0492/pkg/kubelet/prober/prober.go#L146) for each execution.\r\n>- New object will need to be stored in [worker](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/4dfd2fe74d96f67c9752bbdc9ae9983a6e5f0492/pkg/kubelet/prober/worker.go#L40) that for http probes will hold the http request object.

If you can send the small benchmark results on probes with and without this optimization, it will be a good starting point. Note, for the benchmark, each probe can run once a second, not more often.

      "description" : "PROBLEM\nWe require ALL commits in a PR to be marked as 'verified' by github (green icon) in order to be able to merge code into main.\nWe have documentation that explains that.\nHowever, we still get PR's that have some or all commits that are not verified.\nAs a maintainer, we need to comment on PR's manually to remind people and explain how to do it.\n\nSOLUTION\nWe can create a github bot that recognises a pull request marked as ready for review that has unverified commits.\nImmediately, it should respond something nice but informative e.g.\n\n\"Hi, this is PythonBot. I've noticed your pull request has commits that are not all marked as verified. For your pull request to be able to be merged, each commit must be verified.\nPlease read our documentation explaining signing and our general process to resolve this issue.\nReach out to us on discord or attend our community meetings for hands-on-help\"\n\nhere we should point to:\ndocs/sdk_developers/signing.md\n/README.md\ndocs/discord.md\n\nIMPLEMENTATION\n1. We need to first recognise when there is a new pull request to the python sdk repo\n\nWe could use a github action to extract the pull request number when it is created\nname: Check PR Commits\n\non:\n  pull_request:\n    types: [opened, reopened, synchronize]  # triggers when a PR is created or updated\n\njobs:\n  check_commits:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Print PR number\n        run: |\n          echo \"This PR number is ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}\"\n          echo \"This PR title is ${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}\"\n\n(improve this please)\n\n2. Once we know the PR number\nGithub has an API that we can extract data to check a pull request is 'verified'.\n \nfor example, for pull request 748: https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-python/pulls\nthe api is:\nhttps://api.github.com/repos/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-python/pulls/748/commits\ni.e\nhttps://api.github.com/repos/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-python/pulls/{pull_request_number}/commits\n\nnotice there are 11 instances of \"verified\": true and there are 11 commits, therefore, all are verified.\n\nWe should:\n- [ ] Extract the data from the pull request added\n- [ ] Check if all commits are verified\n\nSo something like\n          PR_NUMBER=${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}\n          REPO=\"${{ github.repository }}\"\n\n          echo \"\uD83D\uDD0E Checking commits in PR #$PR_NUMBER...\"\n\n          UNVERIFIED=$(gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --repo $REPO --json commits --jq '.commits[].commit | select(.verification.verified == false) | .oid')\n\n3. Once we know there are unverified commits, we send a frindly help bot reminder\n?????? Some commits in this PR are **not verified**. Verified commits are required to merge.\n..... (add the message)\n\nSteps 1,2,3 I think can be created as one github workflow.\n\nwe could call it:\n.github/workflows/bot-verified-commits.yml\n\nSUCCESS CRITERIA\nFor this workflow to be accepted, it must actually work. Meaning:\n\nA user submits a PR:\n- [ ] If a commit is not verified in that PR, they should receive the bot message\n- [ ] PR's with all commits verified should never receive a bot message\n\nEXTRA REQUIREMENTS\nRemember our process requires commits to be verified\nuse:\ngit commit -S -s -m \"....\"\nadditionally, you need a changelog entry\n\nPlease read README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md\n\nThank you\n\n\nSAMPLE\nhere is an AI generated example which is unlikely to work and requires some thinking, but serves as an illustration\nFor example, notice that the packages that are being called are clearly outdated. For example, it is using checkout 4 but notice 5 is out. https://github.com/actions/checkout\n\nSo if you copy this it will not be accepted - please verify everything - thank you\nI also don't know if a workflow is the correct approach - open to ideas\n\nname: Verify PR Commits\n\non:\n  pull_request:\n    types: [opened, reopened, synchronize]  # Trigger for new or updated PRs\n\njobs:\n  verify-commits:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout PR\n        uses: actions/checkout@v4\n\n      - name: Setup GitHub CLI\n        uses: cli/cli-action@v2\n\n      - name: Check PR commits for verification\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n        run: |\n          PR_NUMBER=${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}\n          REPO=\"${{ github.repository }}\"\n\n          echo \"\uD83D\uDD0E Checking commits in PR #$PR_NUMBER...\"\n\n          # Get unverified commit SHAs\n          UNVERIFIED=$(gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --repo $REPO --json commits --jq '.commits[].commit | select(.verification.verified == false) | .oid')\n\n          if [ -n \"$UNVERIFIED\" ]; then\n            echo \"??? Found unverified commits: $UNVERIFIED\"\n            # Post a comment on the PR\n            gh pr comment $PR_NUMBER --repo $REPO --body \"\n?????? Some commits in this PR are **not verified**. Verified commits are required to merge.\n\nPlease see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-python/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions on signing commits.\n\nIf you are new to open source contributions, check our guide: [Good First Issues](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+org%3Ahiero-ledger+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)\n\"\n            exit 1  # Optional: fail workflow to block merge if branch protection requires\n          else\n            echo \"??? All commits in this PR are verified\"\n          fi\n\n\n",

When repeatedly calling isAddress in an iOS environment (version 18+), memory consumption steadily increases and is not released, leading to degraded app performance and eventually crashing after prolonged usage.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nUse the isAddress function to validate addresses in a loop (having more items than 8k) or with frequent calls in an iOS app (version 18+). \r\n\r\nPlatform: iOS 18+\r\nBrowser: Any\r\nApp: React-NextJs Web app\n\n### Link to Minimal Reproducible Example\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_",

Unfortunately, this class extends directly from the native `Map()` implementation so it would be hard to fix. \r\n\r\nAnother test would be if the issue comes from verifying the checksum.

      "description" : "### Checklist\n\n- [x] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues) for similar issues.\n- [x] I added a very descriptive title to this issue.\n- [x] I have provided sufficient information below to help reproduce this issue.\n\n### Summary\n\nWhen editing a DateColumn cell in `st.data_editor`, the text input always defaults to mm/dd/yyyy format. Regardless of the `format` parameter specified in `st.column_config.DateColumn()`. The format parameter only affects the display mode, not the edit mode.\n\n\n### Reproducible Code Example\n\n```Python\n# this example is run on your own page - https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/data/st.column_config/st.column_config.datecolumn\nfrom datetime import date\nimport pandas as pd\nimport streamlit as st\n\ndata_df = pd.DataFrame(\n    {\n        \"birthday\": [\n            date(1980, 1, 1),\n            date(1990, 5, 3),\n            date(1974, 5, 19),\n            date(2001, 8, 17),\n        ]\n    }\n)\n\nst.data_editor(\n    data_df,\n    column_config={\n        \"birthday\": st.column_config.DateColumn(\n            \"Birthday\",\n            min_value=date(1900, 1, 1),\n            max_value=date(2005, 1, 1),\n            format=\"DD.MM.YYYY\",\n            step=1,\n        ),\n    },\n    hide_index=True,\n)\n```\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Double-click any date cell in the data editor to enter edit mode\n2. Observe how the text input changes\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI'd expect to see the same format as defined in the input-field, not being forced to use mm/dd/yyyy. \n\n### Current Behavior\n\n<img width=\"1077\" height=\"286\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fcd6a74-2d66-4242-89b8-02aba7cf6acc\" />\n\n<img width=\"1067\" height=\"280\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f05f013-3a20-48e8-9fcc-a50c034ce348\" />\n\nAs shown in the pictures, the 19th of may is different when displayed as opposed edited. It ignores the format parameter. Locally I've also tested with different formats such as localized and iso8601 and the edited is always the same. The screenshots are taken on [your page](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/data/st.column_config/st.column_config.datecolumn) the 23rd of October. \n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\n\n### Debug info\n\n    Streamlit version: 1.50.0\n    Python version: 3.13 (3.13.7 locally)\n    Operating System: Windows 11\n    Browser: Mozilla\n\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_",

[The MDY standard is unusual pretty much everywhere except the US](https://iso.mit.edu/americanisms/date-format-in-the-united-states/), which makes this, for me as a non-American, unexpected behavior. From a European perspective (which applies to all of our users), this makes it difficult to set correct dates in a workflow. \n\n**Current impact:**\n\n* Users see dates displayed as DD.MM.YYYY (e.g., 19.05.1974)\n* When editing, they must input dates as MM/DD/YYYY (05/19/1974)\n* This creates confusion and potential data entry errors\n\nThe edit mode should respect the format parameter, making the user experience consistent between display and input. Alternatively, defaulting to ISO 8601 would provide a universally recognized standard. I'd also be interested to understand the reasoning behind the current design choice of MDY.\n\n\nI appreciate you considering this request for future prioritization, and thanks for your time.\n\nJo" ],

This behavior occurs even if all workspaces are deactivated before any reordering occurs.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Open Affinity by Canva\n2. Open the studio manager using the triple dot icon next to the workspace buttons.\n3. Click and hold on any workspace, and drag it to a different position.\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nWhat should occur is a persistent changing of the order of the workspaces, and in the order of the buttons for said workspaces.\n\n### Screenshots\n\nBefore and after attempt to change order. Freezing and crash occurs immediately after.\n\n<img width=\"432\" height=\"532\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78d9048e-b647-406d-ac7f-1a001ba9120e\" />\n\n<img width=\"457\" height=\"534\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/009b6b63-9acd-493b-ab7c-9135bcc324d9\" />\n\n### Logs\n\n```shell\nN/A as far as I can tell.\n```\n\n### Config\n\n_No response_",

I have recently been exploring quantization algorithms.", "@sky-2002 tbh if you are also interested in this issue you are welcome to create your own implementation, I've been having a lot of trouble with this because there is very limited information on GANQ....", "@sky-2002 I would assign you the issue as well. Please, let me know if you have points to discuss ;)", "@sharpenb Yeah, well, I wanted to discuss one thing.\n\nIf you see the GANQ algorithm, the idea there is as follows:\nFor a weight matrix `W` of shape `m x n`, they create a codebook `T_i` with shape `1 x k` and a query matrix `S_i` of shape `k x n` (containing indices of values in codebook `T`, a one-hot like encoding) for each row of `W`. \n\nNote: `k` is 2^N, N is the bits per weight, I found it a little confusing, it feels more like a max unique numbers in a row of `W`. Please correct me here if I am mistaken.\n\nDuring calibration, they optimise these Ts and Ss so that we can use `T_i x S_i` in place of `ith` row of `W`.\n\nNow in the author's implementation, they update `W` like [this](https://github.com/PrunaAI/pruna/blob/a06cb52f85766e5a3e514119c35682ba3dd48b57/src/pruna/algorithms/quantization/backends/ganq/lut_quant.py#L183), during quantization. So at the end, we still get a `W` (full precision, just that each row now is made up of `k` unique values). It would still use the same amount of memory, so I think the author's code just shows the algorithm, the actual look-up table based quantization in inference, we have to build. Otherwise we won't be able to see the advantage of this, since we end up storing `m x n` values for a matrix, whereas with `T` and `S`, we get `m x k` + `N x m  x n` (since we only store index of which codebook entry to pick, not the whole one hot matrix), this ends up consuming lesser memory.\n\nSo I wanted to discuss how should we store these `T_i` and `S_i` for each weight matrix so that they can be used at inference time to calculate `W_q` (the quantized weights)\n\nAgain, feel free to correct me if I have misunderstood something.", "Sure, here are some elements:\n- k is indeed 2^N where N is the bits per weight. It could be that a row in the quantized W does not use all the possible encodings that the N bits offer, hence max unique numbers in a row could be smaller than k. If you are talking about the original W, the number of unique values in a row of W is not related to the number k which is defined from the number of bits that the user wants to use for quantization.\n- Regarding the author code, my suggestion would be to run the author and measure the peak memory of the model before after quantization to check whether their code can be used. Their paper reports memory and latency reduction and say that it uses LUT-based inference kernels from others, thus leveraging the T and S data format to optimize memory and speed. Normally all values in S should indeed be stored in N bits while values in T should be stored in high precision.", "@sharpenb Right, I saw that the paper mentions some other works which implement LUT based kernels, for example [squeezellm](https://github.com/SqueezeAILab/SqueezeLLM/blob/main/squeezellm/quant.py).\n\nAlso, I checked peak memory during inference using the author's code, it is exactly same as original model, because in author's code, they replace `W` with `T x S`, however the values now come from `T` and `S`, verified using this:\n\n```python\n\ndef verify_unique_entries_in_row(layer, row_idx=0):\n    Wq = layer.self_attn.q_proj.weight.data\n    unique_entries = torch.unique(Wq[row_idx])\n    print(f\"Number of unique entries in row {row_idx}: {unique_entries.numel()}\")\n\nverify_unique_entries_in_row(model_q.model.layers[1], row_idx=1)\nverify_unique_entries_in_row(model.model.layers[1], row_idx=1)\n\n\n# Number of unique entries in row 1: 16  (4 bit)\n# Number of unique entries in row 1: 471\n```\n\nAt inference time, we need to replace normal linear layers in the model with `QuantLinearLUT` as in `squeezellm`.\n\nHow should this be integrated into pruna code? I need some suggestions(on code organization and best practices for integrating such things) here. You can take a look at my PR above to see how I have used author's code currently.\n\nOne option I think is to create a [huggingface kernel](https://huggingface.co/docs/kernels/index) and pushed to kernel hub and use from there, this helps pruna codebase remain clean. Because if we just use the kernel from the `squeezellm` repo, we would be placing `cuda` and `cpp` files in pruna, and this would lead to folks not being able to use some other LUT kernel. \n\nLet me know what you think?" ],

I wanted to share my thoughts on the min-height property and why I believe it should be removed from our design.\r\n\r\nWhile min-height can be helpful for scrolling, in our situation, it tends to cause awkward empty spaces at the bottom of the page when there's not much content. This can negatively impact the user experience, making the page feel unbalanced.\r\n\r\nIf we remove the min-height, we can keep the content aligned at the top, which allows for a more natural scrolling experience. This way, users can easily view all the content without being distracted by those empty spaces.\r\n\r\nI also feel that using mx-auto might complicate things without solving the real issues of alignment and scrolling. It???s best to keep our layout straightforward.\r\n\r\nAs for testing my code locally, I???m currently facing a challenge since I don???t have access to a database or any sample cards. This makes it tough to demonstrate the fix effectively. If we could create a temporary mock dataset, that would really help me showcase the solution more accurately.", "@mohamedchouaib For local data generation, you'll need to create explorations using https://www.oppia.org/creator-dashboard. This link may also be helpful for you in the future, it explains how to do standard things: https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/LaCE-onboarding-guide#3-generating-data-on-localhost\r\n\r\nRe min-height, let's just make sure we don't break anything.

Like you mentioned adding mx-auto similar to #20816 seems to solve the problem (see video below):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb83b490-2bb0-421e-bd05-214c4c4178b8\r\n\r\nAs for the min-height discussed, it cannot simply be removed, as that will create empty white space at the bottom of the page. The min-height can however be reduced by 400px (the height of the navbar-container and classroom-card-wrapper combined) to remove the extra blank space left below a search with few results (see video below):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97407eda-a81a-430e-a38f-dfcd484f7fa6\r\n\r\nIf this looks okay, can I be assigned to the issue?

Thanks!\n\nHello @HardikGoyal2003 \nHere???s my plan to fix the issue where the search bar on the Community Library page moves up and down while typing:\n1.Files to be Changed-\n**core/templates/pages/community-library-page/community-library-page.component.html**\n   - Wrap the existing `<oppia-search-bar>` element in a new `<div>` container with a class name like `library-search-bar-container` to allow applying stable positioning styles.\n   - **core/templates/pages/community-library-page/community-library-page.component.scss**\n   - Add CSS rules for `.library-search-bar-container` to make the search bar position `sticky` at the top of the page with a fixed height and background color.\n   - Add minor spacing adjustments (like padding and margin) so the rest of the page layout does not overlap the fixed search bar.\n   \n2.Implementation Summary-\nMake the search bar **sticky at the top** so it remains in place even when typing or when search results are updated.\n- Ensure that dynamic elements (like clear buttons or text length changes) do not change the height of the search bar.\n- Add a small margin to the content below the search bar to maintain consistent spacing.\n\n3.Expected Behavior After Fix-\nThe search bar will stay in one place at the top of the page while typing.\n- The rest of the page content (like results) will scroll or update independently without moving the search bar.\n\nOnce approved, I???ll implement this and show a demo of the fix working locally.\n\nThanks!\n\n", "@Noctis-404 I don't think we use ``scss`` in the codebase, and the files that you mentioned also don't exist in the codebase.

This will prevent it from moving up and down while typing or deleting text.\n2. Files to be Updated:-\noppia-search-bar.component.css: Implement the necessary CSS changes to achieve stable positioning of the search bar.\nSpecific Changes to be Made:-\n1. Adjust the position, top, and left properties to ensure the search bar stays fixed at the top of the page.\n2. Ensure the margin, padding, and text-align properties are set to keep the search bar centered horizontally.\n3. Verify and adjust the width and max-width to ensure the search bar fits well on various screen sizes.\nTesting:-\nVerify that the search bar remains fixed in place when typing and deleting text.\nTest across different screen sizes to ensure consistent behavior and that the search bar is always centered.\n",

Set up your dev environment [[docs](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/contributing-docs/README.rst)]\n0.5. Go to your `airflow` directory and run `ruff check`.  Write down the number of failures.  Mine currently says 8.  This step is just to make sure it's working and give you a baseline.\n\n1. Open `/airflow/pyproject.toml`\n2. In the `ignore` list (currently starting on [line 301](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/pyproject.toml#L301)) comment out the rule you intend to work on\n3. In a terminal, go to the `airflow` directory and run `ruff check` again.  It should now fail with WAY more errors.  Mine currently says 863.  If the number didn't go way up, something is wrong with your setup.\n4. Have a quick scroll through that list, paying attention to which ones failed because of the rule you just enabled.\n5. Come up with a rough plan to break that down into bites.  Maybe pick one directory that has a bunch of failures and start fixing there.\n6. After you have a handful of fixes done: remove your comment (so it is ignored again) and submit a PR with that chunk of changes (see the Contributing docs in step 0)\n\nPLEASE submit these in many small PRs.  If you do it all at once it will turn into a 3000-line PR and nobody will review it.  Eventually, on the last chunk you'll just remove that line from the ignore list entirely when there are no more violations to fix. \n\n\nLet me know if you need any help, or ask in the Slack server.",

      "description" : "We recently introduced an optimization step which runs after parsing but before analyzing the regex pattern: https://github.com/fancy-regex/fancy-regex/pull/171\n\nIt works by rewriting an expression with a trailing positive lookahead into the same expression semantically, by using an explicit capture group 0 and removing the lookahead itself, just keeping the contents.\n\nWe can do something similar for `\\K` at root level i.e. convert `\\w+:\\s*\"\\K[^\"]*` into  `\\w+:\\s*\"([^\"]*)`. If the `tree.expr` is a `Concat`, iterate through the children to see if one of those children is a `KeepOut`. If it is, put the remainder of the children (i.e. after/following the `\\K`) into a capture group which will be group 0, and replace the `KeepOut` `Expr` with that capture group. Then, it will automatically work such that if the rest of the expression is easy, it will delegate the whole thing to the regex crate without going through the VM.\n\nBonus points if it will interact with trailing lookaheads, to apply both optimizations together with only creating one new capture group...\ni.e. turn `\\w+:\\s*\"\\K[^\"]*(?=\")` into  `\\w+:\\s*\"([^\"]*)\"`. Otherwise, we may be able to only one of those optimizations at a time, because we can't have 2 explicit capture group 0s... (or can we? perhaps try it...)\n\nThe same criteria applies as for the trailing lookahead rewriting - we can only do it if the entire expression isn't recursive otherwise it will change the semantics",

When displaying my AsyncAPI spec with the web-ui (e.g. `http://localhost:8080/springwolf/asyncapi-ui.html`), the datatypes of the `payload` are correctly displayed. But for `header` fields, the displayed datatype is always `string` without any constraints, regardless what is defined in the actual code.\n\nFor example:\n\nI have the following publisher:\n\n```\nimport io.github.springwolf.bindings.kafka.annotations.KafkaAsyncOperationBinding;\nimport io.github.springwolf.core.asyncapi.annotations.AsyncOperation;\nimport io.github.springwolf.core.asyncapi.annotations.AsyncPublisher;\n\n@Service\npublic class EventProducerService {\n\n    @AsyncPublisher(operation = @AsyncOperation(\n            channelName = \"[...]\",\n            description = \"[...]\",\n            servers = {\"kafka-server\"},\n            payloadType = [...]Payload.class,\n            headers = @AsyncOperation.Headers(\n                    schemaName = \"[...]Header\",\n                    values = {\n                            @AsyncOperation.Headers.Header(name = \"consultant-number\", description = \"Identifier for the consultant.\"),\n                            @AsyncOperation.Headers.Header(name = \"client-number\", description = \"Identifier for the client.\"))\n                    }\n            )\n    ))\n    @KafkaAsyncOperationBinding()\n    public Mono<Void> publishEvent([...], final Integer consultantNumber, final Integer clientNumber) {\n\n[...]\n```\n_specifics replaced with ` [...]`_\n\nThe actual datatypes for the header fields `consultant-number` and `client-number` are of type `Integer`, but  there is no way to specify that.\n\nThis is displayed as follows with the web-ui:\n\n<img width=\"714\" height=\"297\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a8cc273-3d2a-4ba5-a89e-130c2ff40fce\" />\n\nAlso, the generated JSON looks as follows:\n\n```\n  \"components\": {\n    \"schemas\": {\n      \"[...]Header\": {\n        \"title\": \"[...]Header\",\n        \"type\": \"object\",\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"client-number\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\",\n            \"description\": \"Identifier for the client.\",\n            \"enum\": []\n          },\n          \"consultant-number\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\",\n            \"description\": \"Identifier for the consultant.\",\n            \"enum\": []\n          },\n```\n\nThere seems to be no way to define the datatype as well as constraints with `@AsyncOperation.Headers.Header` or define the headers with a Java Class like the payload with `payloadType = [...]Payload.class`.\n\n**Dependencies and versions used**\n- [x] `springwolf-kafka` version `1.17.0`\n- [x] `springwolf-ui` version `1.17.0`\n\n**Motivation**\nIt should be possible to define specific datatypes and constraints for header fields to provide a correct specification of my AsyncAPI for consumers.\n",

Deploy the stack in Unraid using Docker Compose.  \n2. In the UI, add fan curves for the Dell R730xd.  \n3. Navigate on the dashboard: the sensor data (temperatures, wattage, fan speeds) appears correctly.  \n4. Open the **Logs** view.  \n5. Observe errors in the logs (see attached/excerpt below).\n\n---\n\n**Expected Behavior:**  \n- The UI should show correct sensor data.  \n- The logs should reflect normal operations without error entries.\n\n---\n\n**Actual Behavior:**  \n- UI shows correct sensor data (temperatures, wattage, fans).  \n- However, the logs display error messages indicating something is wrong behind the scenes.\n\n---\n\n**Impact / Severity:**  \n- **Medium** - The UI appears to work, but the log errors suggest hidden issues that may affect reliability or future operations.\n\n---\n\n**Attachments / Additional Info:**  \n- Log excerpt:  \n\n```\nError: Command failed: ipmitool -I lanplus -H idrac.home.lan -U idrac -P password sensor  \n    at genericNodeError (node:internal/errors:985:15)  \n    at wrappedFn (node:internal/errors:539:14)  \n    at ChildProcess.exithandler (node:child_process:417:12)  \n    at ChildProcess.emit (node:events:508:28)  \n    at maybeClose (node:internal/child_process:1101:16)  \n    at ChildProcess._handle.onexit (node:internal/child_process:305:5) {  \n  code: null,  \n  killed: false,  \n  signal: 'SIGSEGV',  \n  cmd: 'ipmitool -I lanplus -H idrac.home.lan -U idrac -P password sensor'  \n}\n```\n\n\n\nLove the tool so far.

Let me explain issue #2480 in detail.\n\n## Issue Overview\n\n**Title:** Add to company cyber dashboard: news about company  \n**Type:** Feature Enhancement  \n**Labels:** Good First Issue, $5 Bounty  \n**Status:** Open\n\n## What is the Company Cyber Dashboard?\n\nThe BLT application has a **Company/Domain Dashboard** that can be accessed at:\n```\nhttps://blt.owasp.org/domain/{company_name}/\n```\n\nThis is a public dashboard that currently displays:\n- **Company Information** - Logo, name, email, organization details\n- **Recent Activity** - Lists of open and closed bug reports\n- **Bug Reports** - Detailed list of security issues reported for that company\n- **Top Bug Hunters** - Users who have reported the most bugs for that company\n\n## What the Issue is Asking For\n\nThe issue wants you to **add a NEWS section** to this dashboard that displays news/announcements about the company. This would provide additional context and updates about the company alongside the bug reports.\n\n## Technical Details\n\n**Files you'll likely work with:**\n- **View:** `website/views/organization.py` (specifically the `DomainDetailView` class)\n- **Template:** `website/templates/domain.html`\n- **Documentation:** `website/documents/BltCompanyDashboard.md`\n- **Models:** You may need to check `website/models.py` to see if there's a News model, or you might need to integrate with an external news API\n\n## Possible Implementation Approaches\n\n1. **External News API Integration** - Fetch news about the company from external news APIs (like NewsAPI, Google News, etc.)\n2. **Manual News Entry** - Create a News model and allow admins to add news items manually\n3. **RSS Feed Integration** - Pull news from company RSS feeds or press release pages\n\n## What Makes This a Good First Issue\n\n- Clear scope: Add one new feature to an existing page\n- Well-documented: The dashboard already has comprehensive documentation\n- Good learning opportunity: You'll work with views, templates, and possibly external APIs\n- Has a bounty: $5 reward upon completion\n\nWould you like me to help you plan out the implementation approach or clarify any specific aspect of the issue?" ],

Check that no other contributor is working on this issue. If someone is assigned to the issue or claimed to be working on it, ping the person. After one week without a response, the assignee may be changed.\n1. Leave a comment indicating that you are working on the issue, or just create a [pull request](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pulls) after following the steps below. [Mention](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) this issue in the description of the pull request.\n1. Fix the issue locally.\n1. [Run the test suite](https://llvm.org/docs/TestingGuide.html#unit-and-regression-tests) locally. Remember that the subdirectories under `test/` create fine-grained testing targets, so you can e.g. use `make check-clang-ast` to only run Clang's AST tests.\n1. Create a Git commit.\n1. Run [`git clang-format HEAD~1`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html#git-integration) to format your changes.\n1. Open a [pull request](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pulls) to the [upstream repository](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project) on GitHub. Detailed instructions can be found [in GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

The character body passes through other objects, but seems to stop at the center, almost as if the shape has been reduced to a point. Interestingly, setting the scale on both axes to be negative (such as (-1, -1)) avoids the issue. This also does not seem to only apply to characterbody2d, not to other physics objects, which makes me think it may be a bug with the move_and_slide function. Could be related to #354.\n\n**To Reproduce**\n\n* Create a CharacterBody2D node with a CollisionShape2D\n* Set the scale of the collision shape along the x- or y- axis to a negative number\n* Move the characterbody using move_and_slide\n* The shape should no longer collide with objects except at its center.\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nThe collision shape should stop the object well before it reaches the center\n\n**Environment:**\n - OS: Linux (although similar behaviout appears to occur on windows)\n - Version: v0.8.10\\\n -  Godot Version: 4.5\n - Type: simd 2d (from the godot asset lib)\n\n**Example project(zip)**\n\n[Rapier bug.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/23047139/Rapier.bug.zip)\n\n",

      "description" : "**Describe the enhancement**  \n\nCurrently there is a lot of boilerplate needed to sync a wallet with electrum, it would be great to have one function that lets you pass in a mutable reference to a wallet and then have it update its internals with block data.\n\nIt used to be much easier to sync with electrum in the prior versions of bdk, it would be great to have a return to that simplicity.\n\n**Use case**  \n\nload a wallet, then sync it with electrum to get block data with a single line of code\n\n**Additional context**\n\nI personally think a builder method and some macros/convinience functions built on top of that would work well, I usually just want a full scan no matter what but every once in a while I'll need a fast sync. \n\n```rust\n  ElectrumBuilder::new(wallet)\n          .url(\"tcp://electrum.blockstream.info:50001\")\n          .network(NETWORK)\n          .stop_gap(25)\n          .batch_size(30)\n          .fast_sync() \n          .fetch_prev_txouts()\n          .request()?;\n```\n\nI'll bring this up in the Thursday meeting with @evanlinjin since I know he is working with electrum.",

Search for a term in Terminal pane\n2. Copy something into clipboard (not necessarily inside the Terminal pane, as in the video repro below)\n3. Paste the copied term into the terminal _(or simply, interact with the terminal in any way),_ then paste again, and observe  that the clipboard item has been overwritten by your previous search term from the terminal.\n\nTo clarify: pasting action is not necessary to lose clipboard contents, it is simply for repro purposes. In real life scenarios, any interaction with the Terminal pane can replace clipboard if terminal search field is open and populated.\n\nThe way I see it, is that searching highlights found items (in terminal pane), and this highlighting acts as if user has selected something, hence copy-on-select is triggered and clipboard is replaced with the found / highlighted string.\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/052fe079-3c7c-4c21-b36b-fd113ba0377d",

This feature was added in [PR #23188](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/23188).\n\nFor workflows, use the endpoint:\n\n```\nPOST /v1/workflows/run\n```\n\nInclude the `workflow_id` in your JSON payload:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"inputs\": { /* your workflow inputs */ },\n  \"workflow_id\": \"YOUR_VERSION_ID\"\n}\n```\n\nFor chatflows, use:\n\n```\nPOST /v1/chat-messages\n```\n\nwith the same `workflow_id` parameter in the body.\n\nIf you omit `workflow_id`, the API uses the default published version. If you provide an invalid or draft version ID, you'll get an error (`workflow_not_found`, `draft_workflow_error`, or `workflow_id_format_error`) [source](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/23188).\n\nYou can get the version ID from the UI's version history panel using \"Copy ID\". This ID is a UUID and should be pasted directly into your API request.\n\nFor more details, see the updated API documentation and the merged PR for examples and error handling [source](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/23188).\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

      "description" : "After PR #189, I noticed that our `build_firedrake_main.yml` workflow does **not** test the Spyro code from the pull request. Instead, the workflow installs spyro via pip to the GitHub repo.\n\nThis means build_firedrake_main part of our CI is always testing **spyro from `main`**, not the code in the PR branch. This bug only affects that part of our CI, not our python tests section (which uses release Firedrake).\n\nBecause of this:\n\n* CI can **pass even when the PR introduces breakage occuring in Firedrake main**, since it is not actually tested.\n* Compatibility issues with Firedrake main only show up **after merging**.\n* New contributors may believe CI validates their changes when it does not.\n* Because most of our users (and devs) use a Firedrake release version instead of main we don't notice.\n\n**What should happen instead:**\n\nThe CI should: use the **checked-out** spyro source from the PR.\n\nThis ensures CI is testing the *actual* code in the PR.\n\n**Benefit:**\n\n* CI becomes reliable and catches issues before merging.\n* Clearer behavior for contributors learning CI workflows.\n* Avoids silent breakage when Firedrake main updates.\n\n---\n\n### ??? *Good First Issue Checklist*\n\n* [ ] Open `.github/workflows/build_firedrake_main.yml`\n* [ ] Find the step that installs pyro\n* [ ] Remove that pip install step\n* [ ] Ensure spyro is installed from the checked-out source instead (This should occur *before* running any tests.)\n* [ ] Run the workflow locally (optional: using `act`) or open a PR to trigger CI and verify the fix\n* [ ] Submit PR\n\n**No change is needed to our main python-tests.yml file in our CI**. Therefore, whoever fixes this can just use the other .yml as an example of what to do.",

Could you describe your proposed approach before starting?", "@tomsun28 Sure!\nI believe the instance label should represent the actual monitored target. Using IP:Port makes the metrics easier to identify and correlate, and aligns well with Prometheus labeling conventions.\nI considered using instanceName, but since it may not always map directly to the actual target, I think IP:Port would be a more reliable choice.\nIf this approach looks good to you, I???ll submit a PR soon. Please let me know if you have any suggestions or concerns!", "Hi @tomsun28  and community,\n\nI???ve been investigating this issue and found that the host value currently only includes the IP (e.g. 127.0.0.1), not the full IP:Port\nThe MetricsData metadata contains only instancehost and instancename, without any port information.Each monitorTask has a globally unique id and name.\n\n<img width=\"751\" height=\"137\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b07ab921-cd17-4c08-9529-fb4ae999685e\" />\n\nGiven this, there seem to be a few possible approaches:\n1. Modify host to include ip:port, so that the instance label directly matches Prometheus best practices. Or add a port field in metadata allowing ip:port to be reconstructed later ??? but these may introduce larger structural changes.\n2. Use instancename as the instance label, which requires minimal modification but doesn???t fully align with Prometheus conventions.\n\nBefore proceeding with a PR, I???d like to hear your thoughts, Any suggestions from the community would be greatly appreciated.", "Hi, @Saramanda9988 sorry for slow response. the reason there's no `port` is because monitoring type like `ping` don't require a port number.  I'll look into this and get back to you, because any changes to this will have a long-lasting impact.\nthanks and welcome to discuss.\n", "Thanks for the reply, @tomsun28 !\nI???ll wait for your further thoughts on this and I???m happy to adjust my approach once you???ve reviewed it.\nPlease let me know if there???s anything I can help test or verify!", "hi, how about this refactor.\nIn `Monitor`, change the `host` into `instance`, the `instance` value is host:port, the `ping` monitor's `instance` value is host.\nBecause the monitor params also has the host value, so we can change `Monitor` host.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3932d7e2-2fba-4216-8135-1f67f5b2d925)\n\nThen change the metadata `instancehost` into `instance`, the value is from the monitor instance.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e700162d-766e-41e5-91f4-3bb9736117da)\n\nThe we can save the instance as promethues instance into TSDB like victormetrics or greptimedb.\nAlso we need update the metrics query, from using the monitorId to match value to using the instance. ", "Hi,I think the refactor makes sense. It is feasible and more maintainable in the long run. However, it might introduce some breaking changes ??? for example, existing users might need to perform data migration after upgrading.\n\nIn addition, some frontend code and test logic may also need corresponding updates.\n\nBefore I proceed to explore this direction further, I???d like to confirm: do you think it???s acceptable to make such structural adjustments at this stage of the project?" ],

      "description" : "Hi there,\n\nI have some questions regarding the Terra Packages repository for Fedora Linux.\n\n1. Considering RPM Fusion seems to be more popular and potentially the one that has more quality assurance (even some upstream Fedora devs have accounts there), and also is the one mentioned in the official Fedora's repos, wouldn't it more benefitial to merge your work with RPM Fusion instead of duplicating it?\n2. Fedora's focus is on Flatpak. Eventually, RPM Fusion and Terra will become obsolete for certain packages (you could argue that, for instance, OBS Studio's best version is from Flatpak, since it's mantained directly by the devs). What is the team's plan on this?\n3. From what I've understood, it seems you guys also replicate some of the packages from RPM Fusion. Wouldn't it be better to follow the RPM Fusion's principle of extension of Fedora repos? In other words: RPM Fusion expands Fedora's upstream (without providing what upstream already provides), so wouldn't it make more sense for Terra to be a central kind of an Arch Linux User Repository and only provide what Fedora and RPM Fusion don't already provide?\n4. Considering COPR exists, wouldn't it make more sense to merge Terra's work into COPR somehow? (Considering RPM Fusion would not be wanted.) I think it creates too much division and leaves Terra in the dark (\"cool apps for the out-of-the-norm kids\" kind of vibe).\n\nPardon my ignorance in such questions, but I'm trying to understand why would I (or any other user) want to use Terra. I personally try to avoid Flatpaks, so if Terra can help me with that I would like to use it, but like I said earlier it seems Terra duplicates work that conflict with packages from upstream and RPM Fusion, and also there's too many places to get packages then (Fedora, RPM Fusion, Terra, COPR...).\n\nMany thanks for your attention and I wish you a good weekend.",

I honestly think it's pretty good to have these questions to clear up what our community thinks of us. Well, some of these questions are addressed in our [devdocs](https://developer.fyralabs.com/terra/faq) though (especially on why we do not replace RPM Fusion). Of course, I will also add your questions to that page later.\n\n1. It is impossible to merge with RPM Fusion. Why? Because we are fundamentally different in infrastructure, release model, and our intention.\n  - The infrastructure is documented [here](https://developer.fyralabs.com/terra/infrastructure). As you can see, it is way easier to find differences than to find similarities in our build infrastructure. The reason for such difference is very simple: we made it *to replace koji and its neighbouring components*. We believe our infrastructure is superior to Fedora and RPM Fusion, and this is proven by the fact that we have more packages and the repository is going well while having way less maintainers to the point you can count them all by your fingers.\n  - Our release model is rolling (compared to stable for Fedora and Fusion). One of the core mechanisms in Terra is automatic updates. You always get the latest packages. Since the implementation, our packages that track Fedora versions (e.g. mesa) has never failed to disappoint dnf, while the RPM Fusion version constantly forces dnf to scream about dependency issues. There's practically no reason to use their version over ours.\n  - Our intention is quite ambitious. We documented the behaviour and macros of RPM. We allow people to contribute anonymously. The infrastructure is way more modern and transparent so that we can attract more people in and outside of the Fedora ecosystem to contribute. We want to overcome the challenges we see in RPM Fusion, while that being only part of our objectives. The point of this project ultimately is not to replace RPM Fusion, it is to improve Fedora in general.\n2. First of all, Fedora's main focus in fact is never on Flatpaks. If that was the case, Fedora Flatpaks would not exist. Second of all, you cannot package many of our packages as Flatpaks, because (a) we have a guideline that prevents people from packaging things that work as Flatpaks, and (b) system components cannot be packaged as Flatpaks. Therefore, neither RPM Fusion nor Terra will be replaced in the foreseeable future for this reason.\n3. Answered in question 1.\n4. Partly answered in question 1. COPR is basically, as you have mentioned, an AUR. Terra is not an AUR, it is a reviewed and automatic AUR. It's more like an unofficial community (rip)/extra repository. Also, we have mirrors, and it's 1 repository replacing dozens of COPRs.", "Hi there, many thanks for your detailed response. I appreciate it.\n\nI think what could be done from now on would be things to improve this repository's popularity and get more users to use it.\n\nI think you could start by improving the docs for a more user-focused approach (e.g. the Welcome page could be a How-To for installation instead of it being a separate one).\n\nMaybe get in touch with official Fedora upstream to see if they wanna mention your repos in their docs? For example, they mention RPM Fusion in the quick docs section: https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/rpmfusion-setup/\n\nThanks for your attention once again.", "Do you mind if I rename this issue to something like \"Relationship to RPMFusion and Fedora repositories?\" This actually sounds like a really good issue and we'd like to pin it, and also possibly add these answers to our documentation later.", "Feel free too! Sounds good to me." ],

      "description" : "### Summary\n\n<!-- Begin your issue with a one sentence summary -->\nI???m not sure why this happens ??? it???s quite strange....\nWhen my cursor is positioned at the final `EMPTY` character, I press `j j` to switch to Helix_Normal mode and then press `o` to insert a new line below. However, the cursor doesn???t move to the new line. If I use Esc instead of `j j`, this issue doesn???t occur.\n\n### Description\nCustom KeyBind, like this:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"context\": \"Editor && vim_mode == insert\",\n    \"bindings\": {\n      \"j j\": \"vim::SwitchToHelixNormalMode\"\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThis causes unexpected behavior.\n\nDESCRIPTION_HERE\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. I wrote the following test:\n```Rust\n    #[gpui::test]\n    async fn test_insert_line(cx: &mut gpui::TestAppContext) {\n        let mut cx = VimTestContext::new(cx, true).await;\n        cx.enable_helix();\n\n        cx.update(|_, cx| {\n            cx.bind_keys([KeyBinding::new(\"j j\", SwitchToHelixNormalMode, None)]);\n        });\n\n        cx.set_state(\n            indoc! {\n            \"hello world!??\"},\n            Mode::Insert,\n        );\n        cx.simulate_keystrokes(\"j j\");\n        cx.simulate_keystrokes(\"o\");\n        let state = cx.editor_state();\n\n        cx.set_state(\n            indoc! {\n            \"hello world!??\"},\n            Mode::HelixNormal,\n        );\n        cx.simulate_keystrokes(\"o\");\n        assert_eq!(state, cx.editor_state());\n    }\n```\n2. run it, and it failed with this: \n```\n---- helix::test::test_insert_line stdout ----\n\nthread 'helix::test::test_insert_line' panicked at crates\\vim\\src\\helix.rs:1479:9:\nassertion `left == right` failed\n  left: \"hello world!??\\n\"\n right: \"hello world!\\n??\"\nnote: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace\n\n\nfailures:\n    helix::test::test_insert_line\n```\n3. This is unexpected...\n\n**Expected Behavior**:\nThe test should pass.\n**Actual Behavior**:\nThe test fails unexpectedly.\n\n<!-- Before Submitting, did you:\n  1. Include settings.json, keymap.json, .editorconfig if relevant?\n  2. Check your Zed.log for relevant errors? (please include!)\n  3. Click Preview to ensure everything looks right?\n  4.

In its current state, it seems advisable to generate a final web page with considerations for web accessibility. This includes aspects such as the page name, language, structure, and named links. Currently, these tags cannot be controlled and may result in errors or warnings in accessible web page verification tools.\n\n### Why?\n\nThe product is described as excellent. However, it lacks certain features related to web accessibility. Enhancing web accessibility can improve user experience and ensure compliance with accessibility standards. This proactive approach can also prevent errors and warnings in verification tools.\n\n### How?\n\nTo address this, efforts should be made to generate a final web page that incorporates aspects of web accessibility. This may involve adjusting tags related to page name, language, structure, and links to comply with accessibility guidelines. By implementing these changes, errors and warnings in verification tools can be minimized, thereby improving the overall accessibility and usability of the web page.\n\n### Additional Context\n\nI know there are some questions in forums about compatibility e.g. with 508 standards (https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/508-compliance-for-streamlit/13579) which of course would be great but my recommendation would be to start with simple compatibilities that do not incorporate too much development overhead, or diminish Stremlit's capabilities.",

The API seems to have reasonable stability and to work as expected.\n\nTime to make a frontend for it so that interested parties can use it without curl.\n\nAcceptance criteria:\nMake a set of new pages and buttons linked to by the main page that allow users to:\n* download a CSV with all the CREs currently in the DB\n* upload a CSV with one or more standards mapped to CREs and allow the application to import them.\n\n\nUser journey:\n* user who has \"Standard A\" (assume standard is SOC2 for example)\n* user want to map \"Standard A\" to other standards but they don't have the capacity to do so manually\n* user splits \"Standard A\" into controls or sections\n* user visits myopencre.org and clicks: \"myOpenCRE\"\n* user can download a mapping spreadsheet template using a button\n* user can then map \"Standard A\" to CREs in their spreadsheet\n* user can then upload their spreadsheet by either drag n drop or by selecting a file on their computer\n* The CRE platform then imports their spreadsheet and notifies the user via a browser notification when the import is done\n* User can then use \"Standard A\" in OpenCRE normally\n\nThis feature needs to be able to be turned on or off (aka feature flagged ).\nHeroku does not have enough resources to calculate gap analysis etc for a full standard and we don't want this getting abused with irrelevant standards. \n\nFor local execution this should allow people to import a full standard. For heroku the ability to Upload a standard should be turned off.\n",

Then the above solution would be even easier, because one could just enter the world as singleplayer with the new password (this could be used intentionally as some kind of poor man's security measure).

This issue has been reported by other users as well, especially in self-hosted Docker environments, and matches your experience where the completion message is shown but the data is missing [[example issue](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/20043)].\n\nRecent code changes in v1.9.1 refactored the batch import backend, specifically how database sessions are managed in the batch import task. The refactor replaced explicit session context management with direct use of a global session object, which may have introduced subtle bugs???especially if the session is closed or rolled back unexpectedly during async processing [[see PR #26795](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/26795)]. There are also known issues with session management and pipeline template seeding in self-hosted setups that can cause silent failures [[reference](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/26656)].\n\n**What you can do:**\n- Check your backend logs for errors during the import process, especially any SQLAlchemy session or commit errors.\n- Make sure your Docker environment has the correct configuration for batch limits (`UPLOAD_FILE_BATCH_LIMIT`, `BATCH_UPLOAD_LIMIT`), and that your database is seeded with required pipeline templates if you are running offline.\n- As a temporary workaround, some users have reverted to v1.8.x or patched the session management code to use explicit session scopes for the batch import task.\n- There is no universal fix yet, but tracking the logs and sharing any backend errors will help maintainers identify the root cause faster.\n\nIf you need to unblock your workflow urgently, consider rolling back to v1.8.x until a fix is released.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

I'm new to this codebase but after @ericcurtin's encouragement, wanted to give this a shot. I've implemented a fix (which works on my machine :) ) for the inconsistent unit formatting issue. Would love to get feedback before opening a PR!\n\n## Approach\n\nI've standardized unit formatting by removing spaces between numbers and units for both GGUF and Safetensors models.\n\n**For Safetensors** (`pkg/distribution/internal/safetensors/metadata.go`):\n- Removed spaces from `formatParameters()` unit arrays (`\" K\"` ??? `\"K\"`, `\" M\"` ??? `\"M\"`)\n- Switched `formatSize()` to use `units.BytesSize()` instead of `HumanSizeWithPrecision()` + post-processing\n  - `BytesSize()` outputs without spaces, uses binary units (MiB/GiB), and avoids scientific notation\n\n**For GGUF** (`pkg/distribution/internal/gguf/create.go`):\n- Added `normalizeUnitString()` using regex to remove spaces between numbers and units\n- Applied to both `Parameters` and `Size` fields\n- Handles all cases: `\"409M\"` (unchanged), `\"361.82 M\"` ??? `\"361.82M\"`, `\"256.35 MiB\"` ??? `\"256.35MiB\"`\n\n**Tests**: Updated expectations in both `model_test.go` files to match new format.\n\n## Why This Approach?\n\nI used a hybrid approach because:\n- **Safetensors**: We control formatting, so `BytesSize()` gives clean output directly\n- **GGUF**: The parser already provides formatted strings, so regex normalization (pattern: `([0-9.]+)\\s+([A-Za-z]+)`) may be more efficient than re-parsing/reformatting (avoids type conversion errors, preserves original format)\n\nAfter testing, `BytesSize()` is better than `HumanSizeWithPrecision()` because it has no spaces, no scientific notation, uses accurate binary units, and requires just one function call.\n\n## Results\n\n**Before:**\n```\nPARAMETERS  SIZE\n409M        437M\n361.82 M    256.35 MiB\n134.52 M    82.41 MiB\n```\n\n**After:**\n```\nPARAMETERS  SIZE\n409M        437M\n361.82M     256MiB\n134.52M     82.41MiB\n```\n\nNow `awk '{print $6}'` works correctly for all models! \uD83C\uDF89\n\n**Files I've touched:**\n- `pkg/distribution/internal/safetensors/metadata.go`\n- `pkg/distribution/internal/gguf/create.go`\n- `pkg/distribution/internal/safetensors/model_test.go`\n- `pkg/distribution/internal/gguf/model_test.go`\n\nSince I'm still learning the codebase, I'd really appreciate any feedback on this approach. Does this align with the project's style? Any concerns or suggestions? If this looks good, I'll create a PR!

If so, could you share it on the `dev` ML? https://lists.apache.org/thread/dfyv0c6g53qw3vjxcb1nqy3myb6yc8q1\n\nI believe it is preferable to discuss that on `dev` rather than GH.

Is the site/content/blog directory structure final, or should it be simplified as you mentioned earlier (using just the year directory directly)?\n2. @dimas-b mentioned a PR for new blog contribution guidelines (README). Should I:\n- Wait for that PR to be created first, then work on removing irrelevant files? Or\n- Can I start working on cleaning up the blogs branch now?\n3. For the cleanup PR: should I remove everything EXCEPT site/content/blog, or is there other content that should remain?\n\nThanks for your patience! @flyrain @dimas-b\n\n<img width=\"685\" height=\"864\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5cb7da62-d39f-457c-81df-e47a23382297\" />", "Thanks, Ashish! Great questions. Here are my thoughts:\n\n1. For dir structure, let???s simplify it as discussed, use just the year directory directly under site/content/blog. That keeps things clean and easier to maintain. WDYT? @dimas-b\n\n2. You don???t need to wait. Please go ahead and start cleaning up the blogs branch now. The guidelines PR from @dimas-b will mainly cover contribution instructions and can land in parallel.\n\n3. For the cleanup PR, please remove everything except site/content/blog.\n\nThanks again for moving this forward!", "Here's my thought:\n1. We can use the same approach as `versioned-docs` meaning that we can \"mount\" directly in `site/content/blog` but the content can be in the root folder on the branch. Either way is fine for me.\n2. Just go ahead, it seems we have a consensus generally speaking. If we have issue, we can move fix it later.\n3. Please, for review and consistency, the PR should deal \"only\" with blog related changes.\nThanks", "???Hi @flyrain  @dimas-b @jbonofre!\nIs there any update regarding the following CI integration with main?" ],

      "description" : "To assist with debugging ISLE (e.g. you expect a rule to match but it doesn't), the `isle` crate should have an option to emit `log` macro invocations in the generated code.\n\nI'm imagining we would emit the following logs, or something similar:\n\n* `log::debug!(...)` at the start of a constructor, logging which constructor we are executing. (Ideally, we would also log the arguments given, but that would require that we know that the arguments implement `Debug`, which I don't think we do? Failing that, if we wanted to get real fancy, we could do the thing where you approximate specialization by making impls for `&T`, `&&T`, etc...)\n \n* Each predicate we test as part of a term's rules' LHSes would have an associated `log::trace!(...)` that details which predicate is executing and then whether it matched or not.\n\n* In each rule's RHS we would `log::debug!(...)` which rule we end up executing.\n\n* Possibly, if none of a term's rules match, we log that fact as well. Not sure if we have erased this information by the time we emit code or not though, so it might not be possible.\n\nTo make this even more readable when debugging, it would be nice if we kept a thread-local or something containing the ISLE stack depth and indented our logs by that amount, so that you could see which constructor invocations were nested within others.\n\nAnyways, once we had this knob in the ISLE compiler, we should add a cargo feature to `cranelift-codegen` which enables/disables it. (Or maybe we just reuse the existing `trace-log` feature?)",

If you would like to work on this issue, your first steps are:\n\n1. Check that no other contributor is working on this issue. If someone is assigned to the issue or claimed to be working on it, ping the person. After one week without a response, the assignee may be changed.\n1. Leave a comment indicating that you are working on the issue, or just create a [pull request](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pulls) after following the steps below. [Mention](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) this issue in the description of the pull request.\n1. Fix the issue locally.\n1. [Run the test suite](https://llvm.org/docs/TestingGuide.html#unit-and-regression-tests) locally. Remember that the subdirectories under `test/` create fine-grained testing targets, so you can e.g. use `make check-clang-ast` to only run Clang's AST tests.\n1. Create a Git commit.\n1. Run [`git clang-format HEAD~1`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html#git-integration) to format your changes.\n1. Open a [pull request](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pulls) to the [upstream repository](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project) on GitHub. Detailed instructions can be found [in GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

This means we've worked to make it more legible to people who either **haven't contributed to our codebase before, or even folks who haven't contributed to open source before**.\n\nWe're interested in helping you take the first step, and can answer questions and help you out along the way. Note that we're especially interested in contributions from underrepresented groups!\n\nWe know that creating a pull request is the biggest barrier for new contributors. This issue is for you \uD83D\uDC9D\n\nIf you have contributed before, **consider leaving this PR for someone new**, and looking through our general [bug](https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_control/labels/bug) issues. Thanks!\n\n### \uD83E\uDD14 What you will need to know.\n\nNothing. This issue is meant to welcome you to Open Source :) We are happy to walk you through the process.\n\n### \uD83D\uDCCB Step by Step\n\n- [ ] \uD83D\uDE4B **Claim this issue**: Comment below. If someone else has claimed it, ask if they've opened a pull request already and if they're stuck -- maybe you can help them solve a problem or move it along!\n\n- [ ] \uD83D\uDDC4??? **Create a local workspace** for making your changes and testing [following these instructions](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Tutorials/Workspace/Creating-A-Workspace.html), for Step 3 use \"Download Source Code\" section with [these instructions](https://control.ros.org/master/doc/getting_started/getting_started.html#building-from-source).\n\n- [ ] \uD83C\uDF74 **Fork the repository** using the handy button at the top of the repository page and **clone** it into `~/ws_ros2_control/src/ros-controls/ros2_control`, [here is a guide that you can follow](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) (You will have to remove or empty the existing `ros2_control` folder before cloning your own fork)\n\n- [ ] **Checkout a new branch** using `git checkout -b <branch_name>`\n\n- [ ] \uD83E\uDD16 **Apply `pre-commit`** auto formatting, by running `pip3 install pre-commit` and running `pre-commit install` in the ros2_control repo.\n\n- [ ] \uD83D\uDCBE **Commit and Push** your changes\n\n- [ ] \uD83D\uDD00 **Start a Pull Request** to request to merge your code into `master`. There are two ways that you can start a pull request:\n1. If you are not familiar with GitHub or how to create a pull request, [here is a guide you can follow](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) on how GitHub works.\n\n- [ ] \uD83C\uDFC1 **Done** Ask in comments for a review :)\n\n### Is someone else already working on this?\n\n\uD83D\uDD17- We encourage contributors to link to the original issue in their pull request so all users can easily see if someone's already started on it.\n\n\uD83D\uDC65- **If someone seems stuck, offer them some help!**\n\n### \uD83E\uDD14??? Questions?\n\nDon???t hesitate to ask questions or to get help if you feel like you are getting stuck. For example leave a comment below!\nFurthermore, you find helpful resources here:\n* [ROS2 Control Contribution Guide](https://control.ros.org/master/doc/contributing/contributing.html)\n* [ROS2 Tutorials](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Tutorials.html)\n* [Robotics Stack Exchange](https://robotics.stackexchange.com)\n\n**Good luck with your first issue!**\n",

      "description" : "Part of #12048\n\n## Issue\nAfter most of the Unit Test migration in #12048, there are a lot of inconsistencies in access control test methods. This is because we did not migrate the many convenient, abstracted, and commonly used access control test methods from `ui/webapi/BaseActionTest.java` to `sqlui/webapi/BaseActionTest.java`.\n\nAfter merging #13254, all of the access control test methods in `BaseActionTest.java` have been migrated. Hence, this issue aims to refactor the unit test access controls to use these convenient test methods.\n\n## Progress\nThe progress for this refactoring can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IcB-viJMrIOknYoBYasBuRBK9qnwY0-doEK4_Eb24IA/edit?gid=0#gid=0). I (the author) will update it when completed PRs are merged proactively.\n\n## Steps to Contribute\n\n1. Choose test(s) to work on in the above Google Sheets link\n2. Check that no on else have claimed the test cases to work on within the last 2 weeks, or that it has been completed by follow up PRs (but not updated in the sheets)\n3. Comment on this issue to indicate that you'd like to contribute on the chosen test(s). Update your comment if you need more than 2 weeks so that other contributors don't overlap with your work.\n4. Create a PR to refactor the unit test(s).\n5. Submit the PR, with a link to this issue by starting the description with \"Part of #13304\". \n6. Once all GitHub actions have all passed (or none related to your PR fails), tag me or any other active reviewers and wait for us to review (so that we can get a notification)\n\n## Tips\n\n- Understand the access control test methods in `sqlui/webapi/BaseActionTest.java`, follow the refactoring in #13254\n- Most of the access control testing logic in the migrated unit tests under `sqlui/webapi` follows the old unit tests under `ui/webapi`, so you may wish to reference the old unit test for help\n\n## Contributions (Last updated 5nd Nov 2025)\n### Merged\n#13254 by @InfinityTwo \n#13357 by @arnav-goel05 \n\n### Approved but pending Merge\n#13359 by @zedonggg \n\n### Ready for/Under Review\n#13385 by @Ederich013\n#13400 by @MCcoc01\n\n### PRs Open\n#13373 \n#13390 \n#13398 \n#13401",

I doubt this is high priority, but I wanted to raise the question since there might be backwards compatibility concerns or design reasons for the current approach.\n\n@zubron these are all excellent questions and it's a very good opportunity to bring @treeverse/product in the discussion.\nIMO I believe there might be a use case for empty values, however we should definitely block empty keys.\nRegarding where to put the validation - you made a good point regarding consistency over all clients when the server handles the validation however also consider the back and forth that could be spared if the validation is done on the client side.\nAdding it on both client and server side might be a good mitigation. However if I had to choose only one I'd probably add it to the server side", "This issue makes sense if user metadata in S3 does not allow empty keys. We need to check this first. Otherwise we break the S3 gateway. \n\nAssuming nonempty keys are on a par with S3, I agree >100% with both @zubron and @N-o-Z. This validation MUST occur on the server side. Otherwise you can create data via the API that the UI prevents. \nAfterwards, we CAN prevent this data on the UI - I imagine an invalid key could grey out the text in the box.", "I agree with the above and wanted to add that it also not just non empty key. for example s3 do not allow the key to start with space and more." ],

So we'd want contributors to not just create a design template but also add tips or notes they think a new user would need if they are starting out with little to no context of the capabilities Kanvas offers.\r\n\r\n### Implementation\r\nMake sure you use [Kanvas](https://kanvas.new/extension/meshmap) to create this template and keep the template private.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Provide a brief overview of what this template does and can help with, maybe highlight a usecase\r\n- [ ]  Add a template that can be directly copied and used instantaneously\r\n- [ ]  Add a step by step process to create this template\r\n- [ ] Once the design is completed, publish it and share the private link with our team, or tag us in the comment component to receive feedback.\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Tests\r\n- Template has been submitted for publishing to the catalog and accepted; is published and available in the Meshery Catalog.\r\n- We are in need of well annotated and described templates like [this](https://playground.meshery.io/extension/meshmap?mode=design&design=09150cb4-b6a2-4eff-87cd-8a35ba94787a) one.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Mockups\r\nThis [FigJam](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1342789621942744845) template can be used for recreating the Sitemap Template\r\n\r\n### Perks\r\nBy contributing to this task, your efforts will have a lasting impact! Once published, your design will be cloned and used by countless users as a go-to starting point for creating Sitemaps in Kanvas. You'll not only help newcomers understand the platform but also see your work adopted widely by the community. Plus, as a token of appreciation, you'll receive a special shoutout, recognising your valuable contribution. Your effort won???t go unnoticed???you're directly helping shape the experience for future users!\r\n\r\n---\r\n### Contributor [Guides](https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing) and [Handbook](https://layer5.io/community/handbook)\r\n- \uD83D\uDEE0 [Meshery Build & Release Strategy](https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/build-and-release)\r\n- \uD83D\uDCDA [Instructions for contributing to documentation](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#documentation-contribution-flow)\r\n   - Meshery documentation [site](https://docs.meshery.io/) and [source](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/tree/master/docs)\r\n- \uD83C\uDFA8 Wireframes and designs for Meshery UI in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/SMP3zxOjZztdOLtgN4dS2W/Meshery-UI)\r\n- \uD83D\uDE4B\uD83C\uDFFE\uD83D\uDE4B\uD83C\uDFFC Questions: [Discussion Forum](http://discuss.meshery.io) and [Community Slack](https://slack.meshery.io)\r\n",

      "description" : "(preferably after #3065 is resolved)\nThe DevRel Program website (devrel.keploy.io) currently does not support a dark/light mode, which is now a standard expectation for accessibility and modern web experiences. Implementing a theme toggle will improve usability, especially for users who prefer dark interfaces, and align the site with Keploy???s branding consistency.\n\n**Expectations & Considerations:**\n\n- Implement dark/light mode using Tailwind CSS dark variants (dark: utilities).\n- Add a theme toggle button (preferably in the Navbar for easy access).\n- Ensure the theme persists across sessions (e.g., localStorage or next-themes).\n- Integrate UI libraries (shadcn/ui, Radix UI, Magic UI, etc.) for a clean and accessible toggle component.\n- Ensure both modes follow Keploy???s design language while maintaining contrast ratios for readability.\n- Apply theme compatibility across all pages and sections (home, program details, components like modals/footers).\n- Respect user???s system preference (prefers-color-scheme).\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n- Toggle button is accessible and works across all devices.\n- Dark and light modes apply consistently across all pages and components.\n- Theme preference persists after page reloads and navigation.\n- Navbar, footer, modals, and other UI components adapt correctly in both themes.\n\n**Links:**\n- DevRel Program Website: https://devrel.keploy.io/\n- Tailwind Dark Mode Docs: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode\n- Example UI Component: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/switch\n\n**Notes:**\n\n- Ensure that the global layout (layout.tsx) handles theme switching cleanly.\n- Reusable components (buttons, cards, headings) should support both light and dark variants.\n- Toggle should feel consistent with the Keploy main website experience.",

Check that no other contributor is working on this issue. If someone is assigned to the issue or claimed to be working on it, ping the person. After one week without a response, the assignee may be changed.\n1. Leave a comment indicating that you are working on the issue, or just create a [pull request](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pulls) after following the steps below. [Mention](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) this issue in the description of the pull request.\n1. Fix the issue locally.\n1. [Run the test suite](https://llvm.org/docs/TestingGuide.html#unit-and-regression-tests) locally. Remember that the subdirectories under `test/` create fine-grained testing targets, so you can e.g. use `make check-clang-ast` to only run Clang's AST tests.\n1. Create a Git commit.\n1. Run [`git clang-format HEAD~1`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html#git-integration) to format your changes.\n1. Open a [pull request](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pulls) to the [upstream repository](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project) on GitHub. Detailed instructions can be found [in GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

The goal is to provide a short, runnable example showing how to handle sequential simulator outputs with the new embedding networks introduced in PRs #1499 (CausalCNNEmbedding) and #1494 (TransformerEmbedding).\n\nThe notebook will:\n- Use a simple SIR time-series simulator as the example.\n- Demonstrate how to instantiate and use both CausalCNNEmbedding and TransformerEmbedding for sequential data.\n- Integrate the chosen embedding into an NPE workflow (posterior_nn, simulate_for_sbi, train, and build_posterior).\n- Briefly discuss when to prefer each embedding type (e.g., CNN for local patterns, Transformer for long-range dependencies).\n- Follow the concise, example-oriented style of the existing how-to guides and link to the advanced embedding tutorial for deeper explanation.\n\nI plan to include both embeddings in the same notebook, since they share the same workflow and purpose, and presenting them side-by-side will make it easier for users to compare their usage without repeating setup code. Once the notebook is complete, I???ll add it to the How-to guide index (index.rst) and verify that the docs build correctly with Sphinx.\n\nIf you approve I will be happy to continue with this work.", "Hi all!\n\n1) Unless there is a really good reason to do it, I would _not_ use the SIR simulator for a how-to guide (it is to much boilerplate code).

We could really just use a simulator that returns `torch.randn(100)` or so, to mimic the format of a time series. \n\nWe should also note that depending on the dimensionality of the data and the resulting dimensionality of the CNN or Transformer architectures, a GPU could be useful here. \n\nand the other point by Michael about the discussion of what to use when - yes, lets not do this in the how-to-guide to keep them concise.

      "repositoryName" : "finos/architecture-as-code",
      "description" : "## Feature Proposal\n\n### Target Project:\n**CALM Copilot (Chat Mode)** ??? part of the **Architecture-as-Code** monorepo.\n\n---\n\n### Description of Feature:\nEnable **voice interaction** for CALM Copilot Chat Mode by leveraging the **VS Code Speech** extension (`ms-vscode.vscode-speech`).  \nThis enhancement would allow architects to **speak** their CALM queries and receive **spoken responses**, extending the existing natural language capabilities of CALM Copilot Chat Mode into a true multimodal experience.\n\nThe goal is to **experiment with voice command usability** and produce a **user guide** explaining how to set up, use, and troubleshoot voice features within CALM.\n\n---\n\n### User Stories:\n- **As an architect**, I want to speak to CALM Copilot so that I can query architectural models hands-free during design or review sessions.  \n- **As a contributor**, I want to document the steps for enabling and configuring VS Code Speech with CALM Copilot so that users can easily adopt the feature.  \n- **As a user**, I want CALM to optionally read responses aloud so that I can continue working without needing to monitor the chat window.\n\n---\n\n### Current Limitations:\nCALM Copilot Chat Mode currently supports **text-based interaction only** within VS Code???s Copilot Chat interface.  \nThere is no mechanism for audio input (speech-to-text) or audio output (text-to-speech), limiting accessibility and hands-free use.\n\n---\n\n### Proposed Implementation:\n- **Approach:**  \n  Integrate **VS Code Speech** (published by Microsoft) into the CALM workflow. The extension provides both **speech-to-text** and **text-to-speech** features natively inside VS Code and is already compatible with **Copilot Chat**.  \n  Users can activate the microphone directly in the chat input, or use push-to-talk commands to dictate queries to CALM.\n\n- **Setup & Interaction Flow:**  \n  1. User installs the **VS Code Speech** extension (`ms-vscode.vscode-speech`).  \n  2. User configures their repository for [CALM Copilot Chat](https://github.com/finos/architecture-as-code/tree/main/cli#calm-copilot-chatmode)\n  3. In CALM Copilot Chat mode, a **microphone icon** appears in the chat input.  \n  4. The user can:       - Click the mic icon or press **Ctrl+I** / **Cmd+I** to start speaking.  \n     - Dictate their command (e.g., ???Show me dependencies between the Kubernetes services???).  \n     - CALM receives the transcribed text as a normal chat prompt.  \n  4. Optionally, enable **text-to-speech** for CALM responses via VS Code settings.  \n\n- **Technical Design Considerations:**  \n  - No changes required to CALM APIs or chat infrastructure.  \n\n- **Dependencies:**  \n  - VS Code Speech extension (`ms-vscode.vscode-speech`)  \n  - GitHub Copilot Chat integration  \n  - VS Code 1.94 or later  \n\n---\n\n### Alternatives Considered:\n1. **Custom VS Code extension** using Whisper, Azure Speech, or Google Cloud STT:  \n   - More control, but increases maintenance complexity and external dependencies.  \n2. **Browser-based speech APIs** (`SpeechRecognition`):  \n   - Not viable; CALM runs inside VS Code, not the browser.  \n3. **OS-level dictation (Win+H, macOS Dictation):**  \n   - Works but lacks CALM-specific UX and integration.  \n\nThe VS Code Speech extension provides the most direct, maintainable solution ??? officially supported, local, and Copilot-compatible.\n\n---\n\n### Testing Strategy:\n- **Functional Tests:**  \n  - Confirm mic icon appears in Copilot Chat when CALM is active.  \n  - Verify that speech input is transcribed correctly into chat.  \n  - Validate that text-to-speech reads CALM responses aloud when enabled.  \n- **Environment Tests:**  \n  - Windows and macOS\n  - Permissions: ensure microphone access prompt appears and works.  \n- **Usability Tests:**  \n  - Measure accuracy and latency of transcription.  \n  - Test typical architecture-related queries to evaluate voice input effectiveness.  \n- **Accessibility Tests:**  \n  - Validate that voice interaction works with screen readers and standard accessibility settings.\n\n---\n\n### Documentation Requirements:\nCreate a new guide for using CALM Copilot in text and voice mode.\n\nInclude:\n- Prerequisites (VS Code, Copilot Chat, VS Code Speech extension)  \n- Enabling and configuring voice input/output  \n- Example spoken commands and use cases  \n- Keybindings reference (`Ctrl+I`, `Cmd+I`, etc.)  \n- Troubleshooting:\n  - Microphone permissions\n  - Linux audio dependencies (`libasound`)\n  - Keybinding conflicts  \n- Optional settings (`accessibility.voice.*`)  \n\n---\n\n### Implementation Checklist:\n- [ ] Review and approve design  \n- [ ] Validate compatibility with CALM Copilot Chat Mode  \n- [ ] Write and test usage guide  \n- [ ] Publish documentation in `/docs`  \n- [ ] Confirm performance and accessibility impact  \n- [ ] Announce feature availability in release notes\n\n---\n\n### Additional Context:\n- VS Code Speech Extension: [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-speech](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-speech)  \n- GitHub Copilot Chat Documentation  \n",

Set up Appwrite 1.8.0 with GitHub App integration\n2. Connect a repository to an Appwrite Site\n3. Open a pull request or push to a branch\n4. GitHub sends webhook to `/v1/vcs/github/events`\n5. Check Docker logs: `docker logs appwrite`\n\n## Expected Behavior\n- Webhook processes successfully\n- Lock documents are created and cleaned up\n- Build job is queued\n- Preview deployment starts\n\n## Actual Behavior\n- Webhook processing fails with error:\n```\n[Error] Method: POST\n[Error] URL: /v1/vcs/github/events\n[Error] Type: Appwrite\\Extend\\Exception\n[Error] Message: No permissions provided for action 'delete'\n[Error] File: /usr/src/code/app/controllers/api/vcs.php\n[Error] Line: 505\n```\n- Builds never start\n- Preview deployments remain in \"waiting\" state\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\n**File:** `/usr/src/code/app/controllers/api/vcs.php`\n\nThe `/v1/vcs/github/events` endpoint has:\n```php\n->label('scope', 'public')\n```\n\nThis means webhooks run without authenticated user context. However, the cleanup code in `finally` blocks attempts to delete `vcsCommentLocks` documents without bypassing authorization:\n\n**Lines 169, 240, and 461:**\n```php\n} finally {\n    $dbForPlatform->deleteDocument('vcsCommentLocks', $latestCommentId);\n}\n```\n\nThese should use `Authorization::skip()` like other administrative operations in the same file (e.g., lines 1375-1379 where installations and repositories are deleted).\n\n## Proposed Fix\n\nWrap all three `deleteDocument('vcsCommentLocks', ...)` calls with `Authorization::skip()`:\n\n```php\n} finally {\n    Authorization::skip(fn () => $dbForPlatform->deleteDocument('vcsCommentLocks', $latestCommentId));\n}\n```\n\n**Affected Lines:**\n- Line 169 (in PR comment update block)\n- Line 240 (in branch comment update block)  \n- Line 461 (in preview URL comment update block)\n\n## Verification\nAfter applying the patch and restarting the container, webhooks process successfully and builds start as expected.\n\n## Additional Context\n- The bug exists because the cleanup operations were not given the same authorization bypass as other administrative operations in the VCS controller\n- The `vcsCommentLocks` collection is used for concurrency control to prevent race conditions when updating GitHub comments\n- These are purely internal housekeeping operations that should always succeed regardless of user context\n\n## Workaround\nManually patch the file in the running container:\n```bash\ndocker exec appwrite sh -c \"sed -i 's|\\$dbForPlatform->deleteDocument('\\''vcsCommentLocks'\\''', \\$latestCommentId);|Authorization::skip(fn () => \\$dbForPlatform->deleteDocument('\\''vcsCommentLocks'\\''', \\$latestCommentId));|g' /usr/src/code/app/controllers/api/vcs.php\"\ndocker restart appwrite\n```",

Fork and star :star: the CuPy repository :wink:\r\n\r\n1. Pick a function you want to work on from any of the modules listed above. You can find the function in the [SciPy API Reference](https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/reference/index.html) to understand what should be implemented. If you want to work on new modules (\uD83E\uDD5A), first discuss with us on this issue.\r\n\r\n1. Implement a function in your branch. If you need help, join [Gitter](https://gitter.im/cupy/community) or just ask for help in this issue.\r\n\r\n1. Don't forget to write a test code!\r\n\r\n1. Build CuPy and run tests to confirm that the function runs fine:\r\n  `pip install -e . && pytest tests/cupyx_tests/scipy_tests/PATH_TO_YOUR_TEST`\r\n   See the [Contribution Guide](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/latest/contribution.html#unit-testing) for details.\r\n\r\n1. Submit a pull-request to the `main` branch.\r\n\r\nNote that you will need a GPU environment to develop CuPy.\r\n\r\nSee also: NumPy API Tracker Issue #6078",

Please describe.**\nAt the moment all the algorithms from `lib` return `DataFrame` and only `PageRank` returns a new `GraphFrame` where `vertices` has an additional column.\n\n**Describe the solution you would like**\n1. Add an argument to PySpark wrappers like `legacy_mode: bool` that is true by default to avoid breaking changes\n2. Based on this argument, if legacy mode we are returning from PageRank a `GraphFrame`, but if it is false only a DataFrame of scores\n3. Raise a deprecation warning if the `legacy_mode` is true with a messages that in future version PageRank will return only DataFrame with scores\n4. Add the same argument to scala parts\n\n**Component**\n\n<!-- If you do not know what components is it leave empty -->\n\n- [x] Scala Core Internal\n- [x] Scala API\n- [x] Spark Connect Plugin\n- [ ] Infrastructure\n- [x] PySpark Classic\n- [x] PySpark Connect\n\n**Additional context**\n\nWe can plan it for the future 1.0 release to follow a semantic versioning.

As a result, they show up in the front of the history view as they have null endTime. Instead the missions should simply be deprecated (in practise deleted), as they are simply invalid missions which were never ran.\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSee the mission history in Dev on Huldra.\n\n**Expected behavior**\nMissions in the history view should only be missions that were actually attempted started. EndTime should be expected for all aborted missions.\n\n**Screenshots**\n\n<img width=\"813\" height=\"384\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/458fe5c7-2b48-4186-baeb-87df50169c63\" />\n\n<img width=\"1316\" height=\"499\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/857537e1-130e-453f-9c0a-58dc13e59474\" />\n\n",

This is why I am reporting an error.\r\n\r\nI don't know if it is a bug for `FixYear`, `FixMonth`, and `FixDay` properties.\r\n\r\nNote: Currently I categorized `FixYear`, `FixMonth`, and `FixDay` properties to the \"Picker behavior\" group. If it is a bug, then after it is fixed, the `FixYear`, `FixMonth`, and `FixDay` properties can be categorized to the \"Validation\" group. I categorized `MinDate`, and `MaxDate` to the \"Validation\" group. See https://github.com/MudBlazor/MudBlazor/pull/3413 pull request.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe `MinDate` and `MaxDate` properties don't allow to enter incorrect values by keyboard.\n\n### Reproduction link\n\nhttps://try.mudblazor.com/snippet/caQFlPGjqkazvvIW\n\n### Reproduction steps\n\n1. Open https://try.mudblazor.com/snippet/caQFlPGjqkazvvIW\r\n2. Enter an incorrect value using a keyboard\r\n3. The incorrect value is stored in `date1` or `date2` field.\r\n\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### Version (bug)\n\n6.0.2\n\n### Version (working)\n\n_No response_\n\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\n\nChrome\n\n### On what operating system are you experiencing the issue?\n\nWindows\n\n### Pull Request\n\n- [ ] I would like to do a Pull Request\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct",

There seem to be different names for the bell in the source code, sometimes it is called bell (`containsBell`), sometimes it is alert (`isAlert`)? I implemented this as if alert means bell (though in my tests this fells on the bell character, not sure yet why, not changed any code there. I tested only with the iOS bell character/alert button though).\n\n---\n\nI implemented it this way:\nIf `buzzer_mode == 4` (`DIRECT_MSG_ONLY`) and `alert_messages_buzzer` is on - then only buzz on DMs.\nIs this the way you wanted it to be? Then I could create a pull request for it.\n\nBtw: The only menu I found to change the buzzer_mode is in baseUI, neither in webclient nor in iOS I could find the option. I tested my changes with meshtastic-cli (`meshtastic --set device.buzzer_mode 4`).\n\n", "This issue has not had any comment or update in the last month.

But they don't yet work.\n\nIn your browser console, notice a log message like this:\n\n> Sheet selection resizing is not yet implemented\n\nI had previously set up the event handlers for this shortcut but not finished implementing the selection mutation. This should be a pretty straightforward task for someone to pick up from here.\n\nAt the bottom of `SheetSelection.ts`, you can find the code location for this log statement. Finish implementing the `resized` method, as described in the comment. Play with Google Sheets to get a good understanding of how <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Arrow</kbd> keys work. Pay particular attention to the (literal!) edge cases when the selection has reached the edge of the sheet.\n\n",

Because our audience is programmers who love running odd devices or even developing their own browsers, we try to be conservative about what browser features we depend on. It looks like [Popover is Baseline 2025](https://caniuse.com/wf-popover), not \"Widely Available\".\n\nI checked and misread this. I thought the JS API was too recent but the HTML attributes met our standards. We'll have to change our approach. @fedemp, I'm sorry I didn't catch this when you suggested popover to avoid wasting your time.\n\nSecondarily, we should look into whether there's a linter we can use to programmatically catch these. It's a well-worn joke that programmers don't read docs, but a comment at the top of the file isn't effective.", "What a shame. I knew the rule about baseline, but I failed to notice the difference between \"widely available\" and \"newly available\". \n\nEdit: I deleted a long, unnecessary essay to focus on code. I have installed ESR 115 to check what can be done. I found a possible solution if you agree to remove support for the caches in some browsers:\n\n```css\n// Hide all dropdowns\n.archive-dropdown {\n\tdisplay: none;\n}\n\n// Revert the display: none in browser that understand the :open selector\n.archive-dropdown:open,\n.archive-dropdown:not(:open) {\n\tdisplay: revert;\n}\n```\n\nEdit 2: What do you think of this? Browsers that don't implement Popover have \"caches\" always visible.\n\n<img width=\"917\" height=\"104\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e11321f4-ce33-4f68-bd8b-fb09a582f96e\" />" ],

      "description" : "(This is a follow-up to #13584)\n\nWe have a library consistency check for checking whether fields in a set of entries are set/unset consistently. Currently, this is aware of the difference of BibTeX and BibLaTeX, but not [Custom Entry Types](https://docs.jabref.org/setup/customentrytypes) \n\n??? This is a good excercise to learn test-driven development and using a data model. This issue cannot be solved with an AI. You really have to think though BibTeX and BibLaTeX for yourself! Take this issue only if you are willing to invest significant time. ???\n\nExample entry - from https://dblp.org/rec/journals/sqj/IftikharBAK25.html\n\n```bibtex\n@article{DBLP:journals/sqj/IftikharBAK25,\n  author       = {Umar Iftikhar and\n                  J{\\\"{u}}rgen B{\\\"{o}}rstler and\n                  Nauman Bin Ali and\n                  Oliver Kopp},\n  title        = {Supporting the identification of prevalent quality issues in code\n                  changes by analyzing reviewers' feedback},\n  journal      = {Softw. Qual. J.},\n  volume       = {33},\n  number       = {2},\n  pages        = {22},\n  year         = {2025},\n  url          = {https://doi.org/10.1007/s11219-025-09720-9},\n  doi          = {10.1007/S11219-025-09720-9},\n  timestamp    = {Mon, 12 May 2025 21:02:32 +0200},\n  biburl       = {https://dblp.org/rec/journals/sqj/IftikharBAK25.bib},\n  bibsource    = {dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org}\n}\n```\n\nIt contains `bibourl` and `bibsource`\n\nOne could make these two fields required.\n\n```bibtex\n@article{withBibSource,\n  journal      = {Softw. Qual. J.},\n  bibsource = {2025}\n}\n\n@article{withoutBibSource,\n  journal      = {Softw. Qual. J.},\n}\n```\n\nWith the existing consistency check, `bibsource` is reported as `unknown`. If the entry type `article` is modified to have this as optional field, it is reported as optional.\n\n## Task\n\n- Modify `org.jabref.logic.quality.consistency.BibliographyConsistencyCheck` to use `org.jabref.model.entry.BibEntryTypesManager` instead of org.jabref.model.entry.types.BiblatexEntryTypeDefinitions#ALL\n\n## Hints\n\n- Do test-driven development. Start at`org.jabref.logic.quality.consistency.BibliographyConsistencyCheckTest`. Do not modify existing tests; add new ones.\n- Look into `org.jabref.model.entry.BibEntryTypesManagerTest` for how to mock `BibEntryTypesManager`.\n- Do not get confused with \"library\" and \"database\". User-facing we talk about \"library\", inside the code, we use \"database\", but mean \"library\".\n",

I have a question regarding the usage behind `requiredFields` which is declared in the method `check`: https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/jablib/src/main/java/org/jabref/logic/quality/consistency/BibliographyConsistencyCheck.java#L105\n\nThe method javadoc says that it \"does not check whether all required fields are present...\" but the usage of the `requiredFields` variable seems to attempt this anyways. Even then, it doesn't seem to check it properly. It seems overly strict, requiring that all subfields of an `OrFields` should be present for an entry to be considered consistent. It does this by flattening the `OrFields` on line 143, and then filtering a filter operation using `requiredFields` on line 80.\n\nFrom my understanding, at least one (not all) subfield(s) of an `OrFields` type should be present for that field's requirement to be satisfied.\n\nI'm asking this question to confirm and improve my understanding of the class and how I can modify it for this PR", "### ???

This feature allows users to submit ideas, vote on their favorites, and actively participate in bringing top-voted ideas to life through collaborative development. Here's a detailed overview of the feature, enhanced with functionalities to ensure engagement and utility.\n\n---\n\n## **Feature Workflow Overview**\n1. **Idea Submission Window (First Week of Every Month):**\n   - Allow users to submit their project ideas within the first week of every month.\n   - Display a countdown timer on the homepage indicating the time left to submit ideas.\n   - Ideas are displayed publicly for voting immediately after submission.\n\n2. **Voting Phase (Throughout the Month):**\n   - Users can like or upvote their favorite ideas to boost their ranking.\n   - A **\"Trending Now\" Section** highlights the top-voted ideas dynamically.\n\n3. **End-of-Month Selection (Final Week):**\n   - At the end of the month, the top **1 most-voted idea** is selected for community implementation.\n   - Recognize contributors with badges like **\"Innovator of the Month\"** for the selected idea.\n\n4. **Community Collaboration (Next Month):**\n   - The selected idea is moved to a **???Project Development Hub???** where the community collaborates to implement it.\n   - Users can join specific tasks like design, development, testing, or documentation.\n\n---\n\n## **Detailed Features**\n### **1. Idea Submission**\n- **Submission Form:**\n  - **Title:** A short, engaging title for the idea.\n  - **Description:** Provide details about the project, its purpose, and potential use cases.\n  - **Tags:** Keywords for categorization (e.g., #AI, #Frontend, #OpenSource).\n  - **Resources Needed:** Option to list the skills or tools required for implementation.\n  - **Optional Media Uploads:** Attach images, mockups, or concept diagrams.\n\n- **Validation:** Ensure users can only submit one idea per month.\n\n### **2.

Collaboration Hub for Top Ideas**\nOnce an idea is selected:\n- **Task Board:** Break the project into smaller tasks (design, code, testing, etc.) and allow users to claim tasks based on their expertise.\n- **Role-Based Contributions:** Assign roles like Project Lead, Developer, Designer, Tester, etc., to contributors.\n- **Community Chatroom:** Add a real-time chat or discussion board for seamless collaboration.\n- **Progress Tracker:** Use a Kanban-style board to show progress and keep the community updated.\n\n### **4. Rewards & Recognition**\n- **Innovator of the Month:** Recognize the user whose idea is selected with a badge and showcase them on the homepage.\n- **Contributor Highlights:** Display names of all contributors to the implemented project.\n- **Portfolio Integration:** Allow contributors to link their involvement to their profiles as achievements.\n\n### **5. User-Friendly Discovery**\n- **Browse Ideas by Category:** Filter ideas by tags or categories (e.g., Web Development, Machine Learning).\n- **Search and Sort:** Allow sorting by trending, newest, or highest-voted ideas.\n- **Idea History:** Maintain an archive of past submitted ideas for inspiration.\n\n### **6.

      "repositoryName" : "Sekai-World/sekai-viewer",
      "description" : "**Motivation.**\nThe current database structure does not fully support songs that have multiple music video (MV) types (e.g., 2DMV and 3DMV) and the display of the music video option is fully depend on whether there is a virtual singer version mv. This also leads to inaccuracies in tracking the corresponding full-length audio, as different MVs can have different full-length audio tracks, and the database currently only seems to track one \"long version\" per song.\n\n**Related issue (if applicable)**\n<!-- Is this request related to an issue or problem? -->\n\n**Suggested Implementation**\n1.  **Music Videos:** A single song version should be able to link to multiple distinct MV assets (e.g., one 3DMV and one 2DMV). Currently, the viewer often only displays one or none, even when both exist.\n2.  **Music Audio:** The \"long version\" audio needs to be associated with its specific MV. Instead of a single \"long version\" track, the database should be able to store the full-length audio corresponding to the 3DMV and the full-length audio corresponding to the 2DMV.\n\n**Additional context**\nExample of this problem would be the song **????????? (Star) by Leo/need**: `https://sekai.best/music/570`\n* For the **Sekai version**, this song has both a 3DMV and a 2DMV.\n* The \"long version\" audio file currently in the database corresponds to the 3DMV.\n* The 2DMV has its own unique, full-length audio track which is significantly longer than the 3DMV's \"long version,\" but both its audio track and the mv is not currently represented in the database.\n",

Save the reproducible code example as buggy.py\n2. Ensure that `bokeh==2.4.3` is installed and that `streamlit_bokeh` is not present in the current environment\n3. `streamlit run buggy.py` - This code uses `st.bokeh_chart()` and renders the ticks for the x, y, and extra y axes/ranges\n4. Close the browser and `Ctrl-C` to exit `streamlit`\n5. Go to line 95 of the reproducible example and comment out `# WORKS_st_bokeh_chart()`\n6. Go to line 96 of the reproducible example and enable `BUG_st_bokeh()`\n7. Install `streamlit_bokeh` and its dependencies\n8. `streamlit run buggy.py` - This code uses `streamlit_bokeh()` and fails to render ticks for the x, y, and extra y axes/ranges.  Inspecting the output shows that the ticks are present in a dark grey color, unaffected by rendeding settings in `bm.LinearAxis` construction and `bp.plot` instance configuration.\n\nThe implementations of `WORKS_st_bokeh_chart()` and `BUG_st_bokeh()` are identical (check with `diff -y` if needed).\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nPlots rendered using the caliber theme feature tick marks along the axes.  When using `st.bokeh_chart()` and Bokeh 2.4.3 (legacy) the plots render the tick marks for the main axes and for any extra X or Y ranges and axes.\n\n\n### Current Behavior\n\n`streamlit_bokeh` fails to generate correct axes using the caliber theme after setting the plot background and border colors.  The tick styling fails to output ticks of the requested color.  Legacy `st.bokeh_chart()` renders the ticks as expected.\n\nCompare the output from both function calls (legacy `st.bokeh_chart()` vs `streamlit_bokeh()` generated by identical code.  This must be executed to experience the differences.\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\n\n### Debug info\n\n- Streamlit version: 1.45.1\n- Python version: 3.13.3, others prior\n- Operating System: macOS 15.4.1\n- Browser: Firefox, Safari, LibreWolf, Brave\n\nAll browsers run at their latest available GA version.\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_",

But, it's true that Swift APIs can have arbitrary metadata, and these metadata are labeled by X-Object-Meta-<name> and not X-Container-Meta-<name>.\n\nThe functionality to handle such data is already implemented at [openstack/objectstorage/v1/objects/results.go#L284](https://github.com/gophercloud/gophercloud/blob/4f6d1451acac9260a6901451e146b2bee4742bb5/openstack/objectstorage/v1/objects/results.go#L284)\n\nFor containers, there is no such metadata as per the documentation: [Object Storage API - Containers.](https://docs.openstack.org/api-ref/object-store/#show-container-details-and-list-objects).\n\nRegarding the issue of having characters in object names that could violate the [ISO-8859-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1) or the [None ASCII in headers](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7230#section-3.2) rule, this is already implemented in Openstack, refere to this example:\n```bash\n[stack@undercloud (overcloudrc) ~]$ openstack object set aldokimi-test file.txt --property \"Filename=??-F??l??.txt\"\nCannot set property Filename to non-ascii value\n2025-11-08 01:06:33,742 ERROR [object_store_v1.py:586] Cannot set property Filename to non-ascii value\n```\nBut, if you use the swift API directly to create metadata for an object, it will allow you to add any characters you want, so I propose to add a function to the HTTP wrapper, this function will replace ISO-8859-1/UTF-8 non-printable characters with '?', refer to the code bellow:\n```go\nfunc FilterHTTPHeader(value string) string {\n\tvar builder strings.Builder\n\tbuilder.Grow(len(value))\n\n\tfor _, r := range value {\n\t\tif r == '\\t' || (r >= 32 && r <= unicode.MaxASCII) {\n\t\t\tbuilder.WriteRune(r)\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\tbuilder.WriteRune('?')\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\treturn builder.String()\n}\n```\nIf the idea is approved, I will create a PR and post it,\n\nThanks," ],

Set a boolean when we want to kill a thread\r\n2. Before every st.foo command, we check if the thread running that command has the boolean set to True\r\n3. If True, raise a special exception. (Because exceptions kill threads)\r\n    _So the thread is now stopped ??? yay!_\r\n4. Handle the exception at the parent thread if needed\r\n\r\nThis works well any script where the interpreter often encounters an st.foo command.

Their resources (such as open files, database transactions, etc.) may not be released properly.

Essentially, I implemented a custom component that auto re-runs the app. This avoids the need of an infinite loop in the script. This improves the developer experience (shutting down while an infinite loop is running) while easing resources on the server with a tiny tradeoff from the user.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/kmcgrady/streamlit-autorefresh\r\n\r\nHere's a trivial example.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport streamlit as st\r\nfrom streamlit_autorefresh import st_autorefresh\r\n\r\n# Run the autorefresh about every 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds) and stop\r\n# after it's been refreshed 100 times.\r\ncount = st_autorefresh(interval=2000, limit=100, key=\"fizzbuzzcounter\")\r\n\r\n# The function returns a counter for number of refreshes. This allows the\r\n# ability to make special requests at different intervals based on the count\r\nif count == 0:\r\n    st.write(\"Count is zero\")\r\nelif count % 3 == 0 and count % 5 == 0:\r\n    st.write(\"FizzBuzz\")\r\nelif count % 3 == 0:\r\n    st.write(\"Fizz\")\r\nelif count % 5 == 0:\r\n    st.write(\"Buzz\")\r\nelse:\r\n    st.write(f\"Count: {count}\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nYour use case suggests this could work and may even simplify your work. Given the code structure, the new script would be:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport streamlit as st\r\nfrom streamlit_autorefresh import st_autorefresh\r\nfrom streamlit import caching\r\nfrom binance import Client\r\nclient = Client()\r\n\r\n# update every 5 mins\r\nst_autorefresh(interval=5 * 60 * 1000, key=\"dataframerefresh\")\r\n\r\n@st.cache(ttl=310, allow_output_mutation=True)\r\ndef get_data(timestamp=None)\r\n    client.get(...)\r\n    return df\r\n\r\ncaching.clear_cache()  # not sure if needed\r\ntimestamp = dt.utcnow()    \r\nst.dataframe(get_data(timestamp))\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only use case that I think this would hurt is one with complex UI implemented _before_ the infinite loop. That being said, proper caching could solve that challenge.\r\n\r\nLet me know if it helps or not. It's a simple component so feedback is appreciated.", "Awesome!

      "description" : "### Why do we need this improvement?\n\nCurrently, the website lacks a mechanism for users to easily share blog posts on social media platforms. This limits the reach and visibility of the content, making it harder for readers to promote the blogs organically to a broader audience.\n\n### How will this change help?\n\nThis change will ease the sharing of blog amongst social platforms.\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### How could it be implemented/designed?\n\nAdd social sharing buttons to each blog post. These buttons should allow users to share the post on popular platforms such as:\n\n    Twitter\n    LinkedIn\n\nEach button should generate a pre-filled sharing link, including the blog post title, URL, and possibly hashtags. For example:\n\n```Twitter: https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Check+out+this+blog!&url=https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/2024-annual-summary#social-media```\n\nThe buttons should be visually appealing, lightweight, and non-intrusive. They can be displayed at the top or bottom of each blog post.\n\n### \uD83D\uDEA7 Breaking changes\n\nYes\n\n### \uD83D\uDC40 Have you checked for similar open issues?\n\n- [x] I checked and didn't find a similar issue\n\n### \uD83C\uDFE2 Have you read the Contributing Guidelines?\n\n- [x] I have read the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/asyncapi/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n### Are you willing to work on this issue?\n\nYes I am willing to submit a PR!",

We could decide on a consistent convention that is used throughout the library, e.g:\r\n\r\n* [stable] - API is stable/supported\r\n* [preview] - API is likely stable but may change\r\n* [experimental] - API is likely to change/utility may be removed entirely\r\n\r\nThis badge could be displayed at the top of the documentation for each util.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to add these in if desired",

It would give those a bit more caution without impacting readability for the most part. \r\n\r\nBonus item related to this:\r\n\r\nFor inspiration, both the angular.io and angular.dev domains put more emphasis on developer preview, with colored banners at the top of the page for developer preview, while also linking to the definition of Developer Preview. The old site lumps all developer preview features in one side table header, and the new site doesn't give distinctions in the table except, but both have that banner. I think that is a good practice, so I would also think perhaps at least different color for non \"stable\" features would also be a nice bit of emphasis and styling for this project. Additionally, I think a standalone page or page section for the definitions this issue hopes to establish would be good to link to from the in utility page badge.\r\n\r\n", "(checking in from my work account)\r\n\r\nAdjacent to this issue, I found something cool in the docs today that I wanted to use, but it did not have a badge. Looks like it (`injectRouteData`) hasn't been formally released from what I can tell from the notes or looking at the bundle from v2.1. I think there should be a fallback case in the UI denoting this, or perhaps a doc page should not show up if it isn't given a badge." ],

The default location is set to be the user's location, but there's no fallback if the user does not have permissions enabled. We need to handle these cases safely while also storing a preferred default location in the user config.\n\nThe priority should be similar to the following:\n1. User-defined starting location (from user data)\n2. Geolocation if enabled\n3. Hardcoded default location like a UW building or the CSDC\n\n## Requirements\n- [ ] Create the geolocation flow for the map\n- [ ] Add preferred latlong to user settings (optional for now, see below)\n\n## Important Information\nWe don't auth set up yet, so you may need to skip the user config for now and leave it as an outstanding change, or wait until we have some groundwork.\n",

I think we actually are a little out of sync in how we'd like to approach this, so we need to get to a point of agreement in order to proceed.\n\nI think it's easier to manage type checking as part of the testing process (not linting), so I want to setup `mypy` to run under `tox`. That also simplifies getting the package dependencies installed.\nIMO the desirable outcome would be to be able to run `tox r -m typing` and have that expand to, for example, `tox r -e mypy-py3.8,mypy-py3.13,pyright-py3.8,pyright-py3.13` (don't hold me to that expansion, just an example).\n\nI think you had voiced a preference for keeping `mypy` in `pre-commit` before; am I remembering correctly? Can you speak to why that's better than running it in `tox`?", "Mostly because I have it set up that way everywhere and it's easier for me to sync it across projects. Changes to the pattern usually cause a lot of burden to scale that across other places. But also being able to have it next to the other linters and have the results in pre-commit.ci.\nThough, now that we have in-memory env generation fixed in tox API, I'd be curious to try writing a plugin that would ship a standard mypy invocation. Syncing something like `pip install tox-mypy` would definitely be easier." ],

Can you speak to why that's better than running it in `tox`?, Mostly because I have it set up that way everywhere and it's easier for me to sync it across projects, Changes to the pattern usually cause a lot of burden to scale that across other places, But also being able to have it next to the other linters and have the results in pre-commit.ci, Though, now that we have in-memory env generation fixed in tox API, I'd be curious to try writing a plugin that would ship a standard mypy invocation, Syncing something like `pip install tox-mypy` would definitely be easier.",

      "description" : "### Adding New Proxy Sources\n\nThe core of this project is the collection of proxy sources. We are always looking for new, reliable sources of free proxies.\n\n**How it works:**\n\nThe application reads files from the `/sources` directory. Each file in this directory (e.g., `http.txt`, `vless.txt`) corresponds to a proxy protocol. The content of these files are URLs, with each URL pointing to a list of proxies.\n\n**Steps to add a source:**\n\n1.  **Find a proxy source URL.** This should be a raw text URL that provides a list of proxies.\n2.  **Identify the correct file.** In the `/sources` directory, find the file that matches the protocol of your source list (e.g., for a list of HTTP proxies, use `http.txt`). If a file for that protocol doesn't exist, you can create one.\n3.  **Add the URL.** Add the URL to a new line in the appropriate file.\n\nfor more details, please check the [full guide](https://github.com/gfpcom/free-proxy-list/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-new-proxy-sources)\n\n\nTODO LIST\n- [ ] https://github.com/kismetpro/NodeSuber\n- [x] https://github.com/V2RAYCONFIGSPOOL/V2RAY_SUB\n- [x] https://github.com/ebrasha/free-v2ray-public-list\n- [ ] https://github.com/penhandev/AutoAiVPN\n- [ ] https://github.com/crackbest/V2ray-Config\n- [ ] https://github.com/xyfqzy/free-nodes\n- [ ] https://github.com/crackbest/V2ray-Config\n- [ ] https://github.com/Barabama/FreeNodes\n- [ ] https://vanced.to/telegram\n- [ ] https://free.geonix.com/en/\n- [ ] https://nodeclash.com/free-node/2025-10-10-free-node-subscribe.htm\n- [ ] https://www.freev2raynode.com/free-node/2025-10-10-free-v2ray-subscribe.htm\n- [ ] https://github.com/Pawdroid/Free-servers\n- [ ] https://github.com/peasoft/NoMoreWalls\n- [ ] https://github.com/mahdibland/V2RayAggregator\n- [ ] https://github.com/w1770946466/Auto_proxy\n- [ ] https://github.com/ermaozi/get_subscribe\n- [ ] https://github.com/mfuu/v2ray\n- [ ] https://github.com/Pawdroid/Free-servers\n- [ ] https://www.v2raya.net/free-nodes/free-v2ray-node-subscriptions.html\n- [ ] freevmess.com/server\n- [ ] https://openkeys.net/\n- [ ] https://freeproxylist.ru/en/target/free-v2ray-proxy-servers/\n- [ ] https://github.com/chengaopan/AutoMergePublicNodes\n- [ ] https://github.com/mahdibland/V2RayAggregator\n\n\nNB: get more free list from https://github.com/search?q=free+v2ray&type=repositories&s=updated&o=desc",

However, `np.asarray()` is not guaranteed to return a 1D array; if the items of the argument to `np.asarray()` are array-like, `np.asarray()` will iterate over them and generate an array with 2 or more dimensions. This 2- or-more-dimensional array can't be assigned to the series, and Pandas throws the error \"ValueError: shape mismatch...\".\r\n\r\nThis problem is affecting the TensorArray extension type in [Text Extensions for Pandas](https://github.com/CODAIT/text-extensions-for-pandas), because the elements of a TensorArray are tensors. The example code above shows a simpler case where the items of the extension array are Python tuples. In general, any item type that `np.asarray()` converts to an array of one or more dimensions will have this problem.\r\n\r\n#### Expected Output\r\n\r\nThe above code should fill `series2` with the individual objects at each of the positions in the extension array. In the case of the example code above, that means that each element of `series2` should contain the Python tuple `(1, 2, 3)`.\r\n\r\n#### Output of ``pd.show_versions()``\r\n\r\n<details>\r\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\r\n------------------\r\ncommit           : f00ed8f47020034e752baf0250483053340971b0\r\npython           : 3.7.10.final.0\r\npython-bits      : 64\r\nOS               : Darwin\r\nOS-release       : 20.5.0\r\nVersion          : Darwin Kernel Version 20.5.0: Sat May  8 05:10:33 PDT 2021; root:xnu-7195.121.3~9/RELEASE_X86_64\r\nmachine          : x86_64\r\nprocessor        : i386\r\nbyteorder        : little\r\nLC_ALL           : None\r\nLANG             : en_US.UTF-8\r\nLOCALE           : en_US.UTF-8\r\n\r\npandas           : 1.3.0\r\nnumpy            : 1.21.0\r\npytz             : 2021.1\r\ndateutil         : 2.8.1\r\npip              : 21.1.3\r\nsetuptools       : 52.0.0.post20210125\r\nCython           : None\r\npytest           : 6.2.4\r\nhypothesis       : None\r\nsphinx           : 4.0.2\r\nblosc            : None\r\nfeather          : None\r\nxlsxwriter       : None\r\nlxml.etree       : None\r\nhtml5lib         : None\r\npymysql          : None\r\npsycopg2         : None\r\njinja2           : 3.0.1\r\nIPython          : 7.25.0\r\npandas_datareader: None\r\nbs4              : None\r\nbottleneck       : None\r\nfsspec           : None\r\nfastparquet      : None\r\ngcsfs            : None\r\nmatplotlib       : 3.4.2\r\nnumexpr          : None\r\nodfpy            : None\r\nopenpyxl         : None\r\npandas_gbq       : None\r\npyarrow          : 4.0.1\r\npyxlsb           : None\r\ns3fs             : None\r\nscipy            : 1.7.0\r\nsqlalchemy       : None\r\ntables           : None\r\ntabulate         : None\r\nxarray           : None\r\nxlrd             : None\r\nxlwt             : None\r\nnumba            : None\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n",

Setting some arbitrary value sometimes renders the image unreadable.\r\nDo you think it would be possible to somehow mimic the same behavior of the browser for 'guessing' the width?", "> some other SVG are displayed without setting the width value \r\n\r\nI've observed that when the SVG file explicitly states the width and if the width matches that specified in the viewBox, then st.image displays it correctly without passing `width`. E.g.\r\n\r\n```svg\r\n<svg aria-roledescription=\"pie\" role=\"graphics-document document\" viewBox=\"0 0 702.96875 450\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"702.96875\" id=\"container\">.....\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue with the original `bad.svg` comes from the combination of the `viewBox` attribute and the `width` and `style` attributes of the SVG. In SVG, the `viewBox` attribute defines the coordinate system of the SVG content. When the `width` is set to `100%` and the `viewBox` attribute is defined, the browser or rendering engine attempts to scale the SVG to fit within the given dimensions while maintaining the aspect ratio defined by the `viewBox`.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the `viewBox` and `width` do not match up correctly, it can result in unexpected scaling behavior\r\n\r\n```svg\r\n<svg aria-roledescription=\"pie\" role=\"graphics-document document\" style=\"max-width: 702.96875px;\" viewBox=\"0 0 702.96875 450\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"100%\" id=\"container\">....\r\n```\r\n\r\n> and also I can get it displayed by using raw <img src= without setting the width\r\n\r\nTo do that, you're probably not using `st.image`.\r\n\r\n> In my case, these SVG are generated dynamically by kroki.io therefore it's not possible to known the width in advance.\r\n\r\nThe only workarounds I can think of are to a) explicitly set an arbitrary width or b) download and parse the SVG contents, get the width from the `viewBox` attribute, and explicitly set that `width` value in `st.image`.\r\n\r\n> Do you think it would be possible to somehow mimic the same behavior of the browser for 'guessing' the width?\r\n\r\nIt's not possible with how `st.image` is implemented today. So I'll mark this issue as a feature request \uD83D\uDC4D ", "**To help Streamlit prioritize this feature, react with a \uD83D\uDC4D (thumbs up emoji) to the initial post.**\n\nYour vote helps us identify which enhancements matter most to our users.\n\n![Visits](https://hits.seeyoufarm.com/api/count/incr/badge.svg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fstreamlit%2Fstreamlit%2Fissues%2F9098&title=visits&edge_flat=false)\n", "@snehankekre, thank you for digging into this, makes perfect sense!\r\n", "@snehankekre could we just make SVGs take over the whole width of the container when no `width` is specified?\r\n\r\nToday the default value for `use_column_width` is `\"auto\"` (although the docs say it's `None` for some reason...), which means \"set the image's width to its natural size, but do not exceed the width of the column\".\r\n\r\nSo we could change the meaning of `\"auto\"` to include \"If the image is an SVG and no `width` is set, \"auto\" will make the image use the container width\".", "Agree we should make SVG images take the full container width when `width` isn't set.

      "description" : "Hi! I???m currently working on building a Docker image for AlaSQL and I???ve run into an issue where commands passed to the container aren???t being executed as expected.\n\nFrom what I???ve investigated so far, it seems that Docker doesn???t attach a TTY by default when running commands through ENTRYPOINT, which changes how the CLI behaves. I tried updating the logic in [alasql-cli.js](https://github.com/AlaSQL/alasql/blob/develop/bin/alasql-cli.js), but I think there may be another underlying issue as well.\n\nSpecifically, when piping data into a query, the input is being treated as a SQL statement rather than as data. I can reproduce this behavior both inside and outside of Docker, so it doesn???t appear to be container-specific. Looking at the code in [alasql-cli.js](https://github.com/AlaSQL/alasql/blob/develop/bin/alasql-cli.js), it seems to try to read input directly, whereas I had expected file or stream reading to be handled by the standard FROM helpers such as [alasql.from.TXT](https://github.com/AlaSQL/alasql/blob/0d5c9816659bde946c01a2d6ebb8d062161a1976/src/84from.js#L185), which ultimately call [alasql.utils.loadFile](https://github.com/AlaSQL/alasql/blob/0d5c9816659bde946c01a2d6ebb8d062161a1976/src/15utility.js#L306).\n\nI may be misunderstanding the intended behavior ??? but it seems like the CLI is handling input differently than the query engine???s built-in file readers. I???d really appreciate any clarification on this, or advice on how best to approach making AlaSQL run reliably inside Docker. Thanks!\n\n## Steps to replicate docker issue:\n\n1.

      "comments" : [ "Sounds interesting with docker.\n\nalasql-cli is old and probably needs a good amount of love. Looks like we broke the functionality documented in the readme. Not good. \n\nIm not strong in docker. Asked the AlaSQLbot to help me understand this and got info from the conversation. Let me know if it helps.\n\n---\nThe core of the problem:\n\nContext | process.argv[2] contains... | Why?\n-- | -- | --\nMac Terminal | SELECT 1 + 1 | The shell processes and removes the quotes.\nDocker ENTRYPOINT | \"SELECT 1 + 1\" | Docker passes the string literally, quotes included.\n\n### Scenario 1: Running \"Normally\" on your Mac\n\nWhen you type this into your Mac's command prompt (which uses a shell like `bash` or `zsh`):\n\n```bash\nalasql \"SELECT 1 + 1\"\n```\n\n1.  **The Shell Intervenes:** Your shell sees the command line. It recognizes the double quotes (`\"`) as special characters. Its job is to process them.\n2.  **Quote Removal:** The shell consumes the quotes, understands that they are there to group the words `SELECT`, `1`, `+`, and `1` into a **single argument token**.\n3.  **Execution:** The shell then executes the `alasql` program, passing it that single argument.\n\nInside your Node.js script, `process.argv` will look like this:\n\n```js\n[\n  '/usr/local/bin/node', // The node executable\n  '/path/to/alasql-cli.js', // The script being run\n  'SELECT 1 + 1' // The argument. Notice: NO QUOTES.\n];\n```\n\nThe third element, `process.argv[2]`, is the clean string `SELECT 1 + 1`.\n\n---\n\n### Scenario 2: Running via Docker's `ENTRYPOINT [\"alasql\"]`\n\nWhen you run this command:\n\n```bash\ndocker run alasql-test \"SELECT 1 + 1\"\n```\n\n1.  **NO Shell Intervenes:** Docker's \"exec form\" (`ENTRYPOINT [\"executable\"]`) does **not** use a shell. It performs a direct system call, which is much more literal. It has no concept of \"processing\" quotes.\n2.  **Literal Passing:** It takes the string you provided, `\"SELECT 1 + 1\"`, and passes it *verbatim*, quotes and all, as a single argument to the entrypoint.\n\nInside your Node.js script running in the container, `process.argv` will look like this:\n\n```js\n[\n  '/usr/local/bin/node', // The node executable\n  '/alasql/bin/alasql-cli.js', // The script being run\n  '\"SELECT 1 + 1\"' // The argument. Notice: IT INCLUDES THE QUOTES.\n];\n```\n\nThe third element, `process.argv[2]`, is the string `\"SELECT 1 + 1\"`.\n\n---\n\n\nThe problem you're seeing is a classic and subtle issue with how command-line arguments are parsed, especially when dealing with Node.js scripts and Docker entrypoints. The `alasql` command-line tool, like many Node.js CLIs, is often executed via a shell script wrapper (the shebang line `#!/usr/bin/env node`).\n\nThe most reliable way to fix this is to use a script as your entrypoint that can properly handle the arguments passed from Docker.\n\n### The Solution: Using an `entrypoint.sh` Script\n\n1.  **Create an `entrypoint.sh` file:**\n    In the same directory as your `Dockerfile` (the root of your `alasql` repo), create a new file named `entrypoint.sh`.\n\n2.  **Add the following content to `entrypoint.sh`:**\n\n    ```bash\n    #!/bin/sh\n    # This script acts as a wrapper for the alasql command.\n    # The \"$@\" special variable expands to all the arguments passed to the script,\n    # preserving quotes and spaces correctly.\n    \n    # Execute the alasql command with all provided arguments\n    exec alasql \"$@\"\n    ```\n\n3.  **Make the script executable:**\n    Since you're on a Mac, run this command in your terminal to set the correct permissions. This is crucial; Docker will copy these permissions into the image.\n\n    ```bash\n    chmod +x entrypoint.sh\n    ```\n\n4.  **Modify your `Dockerfile`:**\n    Update your `Dockerfile` to copy and use this new script.\n\n    ```dockerfile\n    FROM node:25.0.0-slim\n    RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y git && apt-get clean\n    \n    WORKDIR /alasql\n    \n    # Copy the entrypoint script first and set permissions\n    COPY entrypoint.sh .\n    RUN chmod +x ./entrypoint.sh\n    \n    # Copy the rest of the application code\n    COPY . .\n    \n    RUN yarn install\n    \n    # not useing install-g as I am haveing issues with prettier.\n    RUN yarn run build-only\n    RUN npm uninstall alasql -g && npm install -g .\n    \n    # Use the script as the entrypoint\n    ENTRYPOINT [\"./entrypoint.sh\"]\n    ```\n    *Note: I also adjusted the `COPY` order slightly. It's good practice to copy things that change less often (like the entrypoint script) before things that change frequently (your source code) to better leverage Docker's caching.*\n\n\n### Explanation: `ENTRYPOINT [\"executable\"]` vs `ENTRYPOINT [\"./script.sh\"]`\n\n*   **`ENTRYPOINT [\"alasql\"]` (Exec Form):** This form runs the executable directly, without a shell. Docker passes `\"SELECT 1 + 1\"` as a single argument. While this *should* work, some Node.js CLI tools can be finicky about how they receive and parse arguments when not run through a standard shell (`sh` or `bash`).\n\n*   **`ENTRYPOINT [\"./entrypoint.sh\"]` (Wrapper Script):** This is the more robust pattern. Docker runs your script, passing `\"SELECT 1 + 1\"` as an argument to it. Inside the script, `\"$@\"` is a special shell variable that expands to all command-line arguments, preserving them exactly as they were received. The `exec alasql \"$@\"` line then replaces the shell process with the `alasql` process, passing the arguments along perfectly. This reliably mimics how you would run the command directly in your own terminal.\n\n\n\n", "@mathiasrw Unfortunately, the suggestion from AlaSQLbot didn???t work for me..\n\nI've had a look into the issue in more depth and I belive that my assumption about [alasql.utils.loadFile](https://github.com/AlaSQL/alasql/blob/0d5c9816659bde946c01a2d6ebb8d062161a1976/src/15utility.js#L306) function needing to read from the stdin rarther than the [alasql-cli.js](https://github.com/AlaSQL/alasql/blob/develop/bin/alasql-cli.js) function is correct. Based on that I've raised a PR to resolve the pipe issue. While fixing the pipe issue I have also resolved my docker issue by removing the logic that depends on a TTY being attached to the terminal since we no longer expect piped data to be read at this point.\n\nI've run the following commands in docker and on my local mashine against my change in the [PR](https://github.com/AlaSQL/alasql/pull/2159) and develop and documented them below.\n\n| Command                                                           | Docker PR           | Docker Dev | Local PR            | Local Develop       |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| echo \"test\" \\| alasql \"SELECT COUNT(*) > 0 as Success FROM txt()\" | [{\"Success\": true}] | TTY ERROR  | [{\"Success\": true}] | Pipe ERROR          |\n| alasql \"SELECT COUNT(*) > 0 as Success FROM txt()\" < test.txt     | [{\"Success\": true}] | TTY ERROR  | [{\"Success\": true}] | Pipe ERROR          |\n| alasql 'select 1 as Succes'                                       | [{\"Success\": true}] | TTY ERROR  | [{\"Success\": true}] | [{\"Success\": true}] |\n\n\nI've also added some tests to cover the above cases along with some other bits of cli functionality.

I need it to adjust dynamically to the page height.\n\n", "I see @injeniero , thank you for providing more detail. It sounds like you want something a bit different than what we are providing for `st.container` currently, where the container elements would stretch to the screen height. I will discuss with @jrieke . ", "@injeniero I'm not sure I really understand. Do you want:\n\n1. All the parameters we have on `st.container` (such as `height`, `horizontal`, alignment etc) also on `st.tabs`? If yes, we probably won't do this since you can simply use an `st.container` inside of `st.tabs` to achieve all the layout things you want. I don't want to replicate all of these parameters for every single container. \nThe only exception to this could be `height`, which might make sense to add to `st.tabs` as well. The reason we didn't do this so far is that on `st.container`, setting an explicit `height` also always makes the container have a border, but that would look awkward in `st.tabs`. Maybe something to rethink...\n\n2. Have something like `height=\"screen\"`? It's possible we'd support that at some point but probably first for `st.container` and then we might bring it to other elements as well. ", "First of all, thanks for following up!\n\nI see your logic here, and I agree with you. The main problem I'm currently facing is stTabs and internal div structure are setup with: \"display: block\". So they don't flow nicely inside an st.container that has `height=\"stretch\". containers are using flex layout, so making stTabs to be flex compatible would make things a lot easier.\n\n\n```python\nimport streamlit as st\n\nst.markdown(\"# Example Container Tabs\")\nwith st.container(horizontal=True, height=\"stretch\"):\n    with st.container(border=True, height=\"stretch\"):\n        st.text_area(\"Document 1\", height=\"stretch\")\n\n    with st.container(border=True, height=\"stretch\"):\n        t1, _= st.tabs([\"Tab 1\", \"Tab 2\"])\n        with t1:\n            st.text_area(\"Document 2\", height=\"stretch\")\n\n\nst.markdown(\n    \"\"\"\n    <style>\n        .stMainBlockContainer {\n            border: solid 1px blue;\n            height: 100%;\n        }\n\n        .stMainBlockContainer > div.stVerticalBlock {\n            border: solid 1px red;\n            height: 100%;\n        }\n    </style>\n\"\"\",\n    unsafe_allow_html=True,\n)\n```\n\n<img width=\"828\" height=\"1036\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9978c980-db5b-4c1a-b7b6-e9782c60d47e\" />\n\nI would like for the content inside the tab to work just like the container on the left. \n\n\nNote: It would be great if we could set the height of the app as well from the API instead of hacking around with css.", "Oooh gotcha!! Yeah ok I agree for this case we do need `height` on `st.tabs`, otherwise you can't make the tabs container on the right fill the parent container. Btw I think for the parent container above you set a fixed height, otherwise I get a different result than you. Fixed this and simplified the example a bit:\n\n```python\nwith st.container(horizontal=True, height=500):\n    st.container(border=True, height=\"stretch\")\n    tab1, tab2 = st.tabs([\"Tab 1\", \"Tab 2\"])  # need to set `height=\"stretch\"` here\n    tab1.container(height=\"stretch\", border=True)\n```\n\n\n<img width=\"757\" height=\"530\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48c02a77-9378-417c-855d-c9ae71a59215\" />\n\nBtw @sfc-gh-lwilby I guess that's related to the min width/flex basis stuff we anyway wanted to have another look at, but I'd also expect that both the container and the tabs container have the same width here. \n\n", "\n@jrieke I'm achieving that by setting this (is the custom css in the example):\n```css\n\n        .stMainBlockContainer {\n            border: solid 1px blue;\n            height: 100%;\n        }\n\n        .stMainBlockContainer > div.stVerticalBlock {\n            border: solid 1px red;\n            height: 100%;\n        }\n```\n\nWhich it would be great to be able to set in the `st.set_page_config` call with a `height = \"stretch\"` as well.\n" ],

Can mention that it can be spun up but won't work without the API.\n\nAnd anything else you think would be useful to add.\n\nEven if you don't have answers to most of these questions, feel free to kickstart a PR - one of the developers would be happy to work with you on it.\n",

So I created a experimental repo, copied ray service code over and made some directory structure and naming change to try to get sphinx/autoapi to work.  I just made it to work today and the repo is here: https://github.com/artemisep/sphinx-autoapi.   If you think we should move it over to the ndif repo, I'll do some cleanup and move it over.\n\nI'll also take a look at the description above and start on some items, do a PR.  Thanks.\n" ],

For example, review where `dm` is used, as those packages may now include this new variable by default - even though `AGE` may have been manually derived or `Birth Date` manually added. I'm thinking of _{admiralpeds}_, where `BRTHDTC` was manually added in `dm_peds`. This change could have an impact, so it???s worth reviewing when the time comes.", "Thanks for making me aware of this! Is there somewhere we can see the dependencies? I would assume `dm` is used almost everywhere. I think it could be nice to have an overview of it before I start to make any changes ready.\nAlternatively, could it be an idea to add a \"new\" `dm` version called `dm_admiral`, as done with `dm_peds` if I understand you correctly?", "@SolveigHolmgaard it's a good question.\n\nLuckily we store the SDTM test data for all the {admiral} packages in the centralised [{pharmaversesdtm}](https://github.com/pharmaverse/pharmaversesdtm) package repo. You can see in the [data_raw](https://github.com/pharmaverse/pharmaversesdtm/tree/main/data-raw) folder that we already have a `dm.R` program which essentially just loads in the DM dataset from the CDISC pilot study, and then we currently have `dm_peds.R`, `dm_vaccine.R`, `dm_metabolic.R` which use `dm.R` as a starting point. As such I would take a look at those three files and assess the impact of adding `BRTHDTC` to `dm.R`, and make edits to them as well if need be. For instance, since `BRTHDTC` will now be (re)derived in `dm_peds.R` then perhaps we'll just need to pre-emptively drop `BRTHDTC` from DM at the start of that script. I'd also check out the other SDTM programs in that data-raw folder just to verify `BRTHDTC` is not used there, but I'd be very surprised if it were.\n\nOne final thing to note is that currently {admiralneuro}'s test SDTM datasets still live in the {admiralneuro} repo (we only move test data to {pharmaversesdtm} once the first release of a package is live) so for completeness I'd also assess impact similarly for that package - see [here](https://github.com/pharmaverse/admiralneuro/tree/main/data-raw))", "@manciniedoardo Thanks a lot for the answer!\n\nIt sounds like a bit of a rabbit hole of a task, but I guess it is like that more often than not \uD83D\uDE04 \nI have a small vacation next week, but I will start to look into it when I get back.", "@SolveigHolmgaard sounds good!", "Just checking in on the progress - did we get this update completed in pharmaversesdtm?

      "description" : "### Problem\r\n\r\nToday, to inform a user that something is happening (and that we can't compute when it'll complete), we can put a st.spinner() somewhere on the page. We also would like to disable the button, so the user don't retrigger the behaviour by frustration (else we need to handle it in code). The most efficient way in the current architecture is to use a combination of session state and callback on buttons to handle these behaviours (click on button > disable button > show spinner in the same st.container() as button OR replace button > display result and restore button)\r\n\r\nWhilst good in most cases, it is not as elegant as combining all this with the isLoading behaviour of base web. See : https://baseweb.design/components/button/ and toggle Primary.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\n**MVP:** A new argument can be added to the `st.button()` api : `loading` or `is_loading`, set to `False` by default. Setting it to `True` would toggle the behaviour to show a spinner instead of the original label. Loading animation should display well on Primary, Secondary and ideally Tertiary (to cover all cases)  (see #6414) styles.\r\n\r\n**Possible additions:** Adding a small text input next to the spinner would be great for customizability (\uD83D\uDD25Computing, \uD83E\uDD1E Hang on...) , and added with another argument `loading_message`, put to the right of the spinner.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n**Loading Primary**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97103608/229562599-664d2afe-1c72-4858-ac98-e477a1ddd06a.png)\r\n\r\n**Loading Secondary**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97103608/229562684-ab887d54-83a3-4001-9154-5887ab47adfd.png)\r\n\r\n**Loading Tertiary**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97103608/229563238-750d227b-6322-47e7-bb66-86df145dde4f.png)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCommunity voting on feature requests enables the Streamlit team to understand which features are most important to our users.\r\n\r\n**If you'd like the Streamlit team to prioritize this feature request, please use the \uD83D\uDC4D (thumbs up emoji) reaction in response to the initial post.**\r\n",

      "description" : "**Describe the bug**\n\nHello! I implemented rapier2d into my game, however i have found an issue. It might not be with the engine, and more the way I'm using it is wrong.\nHere it is: I used a script to toggle on and off a gravity point area. The way I did this was by using the enum attribute \"gravity_space_override.\" The problem I came across was that the bodies did not notice a change in the space override until they re-entered the area. This did work on the default physics, but I don't want to use them as the engine is so nice to use.\n\n**To Reproduce**\n\nChange a space override property (My example is gravity_space_override) with a body still inside\nAny bodies will not reflect the changes.\n\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nThe bodies would update to reflect the changes to the space_override\n\n**Environment:**\n - OS: Windows\n - Version: latest\n - Godot Version: 4.3\n - Type: simd single 2d, although there might be problems with other types\n\n**Example project(zip)**\n\n[space_override_error_test.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18933802/space_override_error_test.zip)\n\n(How to use: Press space to change the override to disabled, and let go for it to re-enable, the body will not go back up)\n",

I???d like to suggest having another option that allows for adding but not deleting. \n\n### Why?\n\nDeleting rows is often a scary thing. I like the ability to delete but I want to do it in a more controlled manner. I???m implementing an option that includes a column the user can check. If it???s checked then the process of deleting is done in the background where I save the row to a backup dataframe in case we need to retrieve it.\n\n### How?\n\nAllow for a new option for the num_rows parameter in data_editor, called \"add\" or something similar.\n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_",

At the time this was only exposed to the Python API for simplicity, since the initial transpiler support for C was being developed in parallel. This was paired with a new angle wrapper registry and a pass to lookup mechanisms for angle wrapping from the registry. Just like the target support those were exposed to Python but not to C. The internal implementation was designed assuming a generic callback interface that could eventually be exposed to C. Now that we have a working initial transpiler for C we should add these capabilities to to the C API so that users can work with this compilation constraints in C too.",

Turns out both popout players are currently not working for me.\nI am using largely the default settings, I only disabled some extra buttons that I wasn't interested in and enabled the popup player.\n\nHere is an image of the YouTube error:\n<img width=\"581\" height=\"377\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6f3ab3e-e83f-4758-9944-99217f330062\" />\n\n### Browser/s\n\nFirefox\n\n### Other Browser:\n\n_No response_\n\n### 'Steps to reproduce' - Which of our features is required for the bug to happen?\n\n1.

      "description" : "Recently I've spent more time working in Graphite and I want to make a point about one of the current design decisions.\n\nIndividual layers have their transforms set relative to parent node transforms. When such layer is moved outside of the parent into a different location in the nodegraph it changes its position on the canvas. It is really frustrating to work around this mechanic, and I believe many people will have similar opinion, especially those that come from other 2D apps.\n\nTwo solutions that might work here:\n- make every layer have its transforms as absolute values relative to canvas origin (0,0)\n- recalculate transforms when the layer is moved into a different place in the nodegraph so it's location, rotation and scale does not change",

That would be expected behavior. The tooling (except in some complex edge cases involving shared data wires), however, should correctly compensate for this so if you're reordering things in the Layers panel, grouping or ungrouping with the keyboard shortcuts, etc., then it should keep the appearance by updating the transforms in the data. So to be clear, you aren't describing the latter, but the former?", "Just moving layers in Layer panel does that. Without touching the nodegraph. Here are better screenshots.

That entry state will be toggled.\n\n**Expected Behavior**: The state between collapsed and opened doesn't change.\n**Actual Behavior**: The entry's state is toggled.\n\n<!-- Before Submitting, did you:\n  1. Include settings.json, keymap.json, .editorconfig if relevant?\n  2. Check your Zed.log for relevant errors? (please include!)\n  3. Click Preview to ensure everything looks right?\n  4.

If you face conflicts, read docs/sdk_developers/merge_conflicts.md\n- [ ] -s and -S sign each and every commit, you must use the terminal/CLI\n\nAcceptance Criteria:\n- [ ] as above\n- [ ] All tests pass\n- [ ] Nothing else changes\n- [ ] /CHANGELOG.md has an entry under 'UNRELEASED' under a relevant section. (Read docs/sdk_developers/changelog_entry.md for guidance).\n- [ ] ALL commits are DCO signed and marked as verified (see docs/sdk_developers/signing.md)\n\n***IMPORTANT*** Your pull request CANNOT BE MERGED until you add a changelog entry AND sign your commits each with \"git commit -S -s -m \"chore: your commit message\"\" which is tied to a GPG key on github (read signing.md)***\n\n### Next steps\n  - [ ] Comment below that you???d like to work on this issue.\n  - [ ] Wait to be assigned by a maintainer.\n  - [ ] Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-python/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n to start forking and developing.\n\n\nIf you have never contributed to an open source project at GitHub, the following step-by-step guide will introduce you to the workflow.\n\n[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-python/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n[README.md](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-python/blob/main/README.md)\n\nWe also have a helpful docs archives at: /docs/sdk_developers \nhttps://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-python/tree/main/docs/sdk_developers\n\nand further information on signing here\nhttps://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-python/blob/main/docs/sdk_developers/signing.md",

This would allow users to configure model parameters (e.g., embedding dimensions, pooling strategies, or precision settings) at launch time, ensuring more flexibility and compatibility with downstream applications.\n\n### Motivation / ??????\n\nCurrently, xinference launch does not provide a way to specify model_kwargs for embedding models. As a result, users cannot adjust important runtime parameters when deploying jina-embedding-v3/v4. This limitation prevents seamless integration with frameworks like RAGFlow, which require explicit control over model arguments in order to register and use these embeddings. Supporting model_kwargs would remove this blocker and make xinference more adaptable for real-world RAG and search pipelines.\n\n### Your contribution / ????????????\n\nno",

      "description" : "I use Gear Lever ([Github](https://github.com/mijorus/gearlever)) to manage my AppImages. It's primarily used to easily add appimages to a central location and automatically create .desktop files, as well as other management operations. However, it also has a feature where either the AppImage's developer or the user can specify an update url (either a static url or a release from github, gitlab and other sites) for each AppImage and Gear Lever can update them. I think it'd be useful to be able to update AppImages along with everything else using topgrade.\n\nThe tool is flatpak only, so as far as I can tell it should work on any linux distribution that supports flatpaks. It also has a cli which can be used to update the managed AppImages from the command line, which topgrade could use. It's invoked as follows to upgrade all AppImages: `flatpak run it.mijorus.gearlever --update --all`. The command shows a yes/no confirmation prompt (oddly enough it does so even if there's nothing to update) which can be skipped using a `--yes` option. An AppImage name can also be provided instead of the `--all` option to update a single AppImage. It does not appear to have a `--dry-run` or similar option.\n\nI've been using topgrade for a while and it is incredibly convenient, so thanks for all the work!",

For example:\n- Installed package:\n```\n$ flatpak info it.mijorus.gearlever\n\nGear Lever - Manage AppImages\n\n          ID: it.mijorus.gearlever\n         Ref: app/it.mijorus.gearlever/x86_64/stable\n        Arch: x86_64\n      Branch: stable\n     Version: 3.3.4\n     License: GPL-3.0-or-later\n      Origin: flathub\n  Collection: org.flathub.Stable\nInstallation: system\n   Installed: 21,2??MB\n     Runtime: org.gnome.Platform/x86_64/47\n         Sdk: org.gnome.Sdk/x86_64/47\n\n      Commit: a88ca3469207cd1ee8dea91aefaee3ce2f6af9ff60d12879afc10d555c9b44c3\n      Parent: d327a95165ec779c57ff142bc9decff41c381c07565126cb36c54c56ad82c505\n     Subject: Merge pull request #117 from flathub/mijorus-patch-11 (d32e19d511d4)\n        Date: 2025-07-04 09:24:18 +0000\n```\n- Package not installed:\n```\n$ flatpak info org.gnome.Extensions\nerror: org.gnome.Extensions/*unspecified*/*unspecified* not installed\n```\n\nThere's also a `list` command that lists installed packages.

If you are new contributor, here are some links to resources to get you started:\n\n - [Contributors documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/development/contributing.html)\n   - [Create a development environment for working on pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/development/contributing_environment.html)\n   - [Contributing to the documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/development/contributing_documentation.html)\n   - [Contributing to the codebase](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/development/contributing_codebase.html)\n   - [Helping with issue triage](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/development/maintaining.html#issue-triage)\n\nPlease also consider joining our [contributors' community](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/development/community.html), where folks connect with each to resolve issues and discuss ongoing work.\n\nIf something isn't clear, or doesn't go smoothly, then you can ask in our contributors' community or [raise an issue](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/new/choose).\n\nAs we continue to evolve contributing to pandas, you can check back here for updates in the list below. Thank you for being a part of pandas!\n\nRecent updates:\n - 2025.11.07: Gitpod, VSCode, and Docker development environment configurations [were removed](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/62859). These development environment setups were no longer maintained. You can refer to the configurations on the [2.3.x branch](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/tree/2.3.x) if you would still like to use these setups.\n - 2025.10.07: Commenting `take` on an issue will no longer add you as an assignee to the issue, and the project no longer meaningfully uses the \"Assignees\" field on an issue. If you are interested in working on an issue, you can leave a comment about your intention to work on it. If there has not been activity in the issue or an associated pull request in weeks, feel free to take over the issue. \n - 2023.05.09: pandas is changing it's build system to meson. See the [new build instructions](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/development/contributing_environment.html#step-3-build-and-install-pandas). If you run into issues, also checkout #49683.\n - 2023.02.24: The pytest arguments `--skip-slow`, `--skip-network`, and `--skip-db` have been removed (#51490). You can use `-m \"not slow and not network and not db\"` with pytest instead. See [Running the test suite](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/development/contributing_codebase.html?highlight=slow#running-the-test-suite) for a full example.\n - 2022.10.24: We decided to remove the milestone ???contributors welcome??? across the entire project. That means that if you see an activity like _\"@xyz removed this from the Contributions Welcome milestone X days ago\"_ on issues tagged with _good first issue_, or any other label really, it's safe to ignore it. Please go ahead and contribute to any issue you are interested in.\n",

Replacing `connect` with `useSelector` is quite an easy refactor, and could probably even be automated with a codemod, so it can be done very quickly and is a nice modernization that also simplifies the test suite. Whereas changing to react-query is a huge refactor that will be a lot of work. So for example, *if* your team has interest and availability to work on refactoring parts of the codebase to use React Query later this year, then I'd say it makes sense to skip this for now.

Check that no other contributor is working on this issue. If someone is assigned to the issue or claimed to be working on it, ping the person. After one week without a response, the assignee may be changed.\n1. Leave a comment indicating that you are working on the issue, or just create a [pull request](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pulls) after following the steps below. [Mention](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) this issue in the description of the pull request.\n1. Fix the issue locally.\n1. [Run the test suite](https://llvm.org/docs/TestingGuide.html#unit-and-regression-tests) locally. Remember that the subdirectories under `test/` create fine-grained testing targets, so you can e.g. use `make check-clang-ast` to only run Clang's AST tests.\n1. Create a Git commit.\n1. Run [`git clang-format HEAD~1`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html#git-integration) to format your changes.\n1. Open a [pull request](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pulls) to the [upstream repository](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project) on GitHub. Detailed instructions can be found [in GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

It is fine to use `this` unless it's bundled, so this should not be `correctness`.\n",

The UUID of that application can be used to test the custom layout.\n\n> What is the minimum memory requirement for this build and any advice for low memory systems that can follow?\n\n4GB RAM would be enough.\n\n[1] https://is.docs.wso2.com/en/7.0.0/guides/applications/#register-an-application", "Thank u for your promptly reply. After follow the documentation and tring to build the custom layout as exactly it explained, I ended up with this error and working on to fix that\n\n_FIX: Seems like 4GB memory is not enough for the build since it raises running out of memory message and stop the build partially. So some dependencies (login-portal-layouts:jar:3.3.23-SNAPSHOT) will not build from `mvn clean install` command on `identity-apps-core` directory. Try adding more swap partition or just use git codespace. it just works. also [this](https://wso2.github.io/using-maven.html)_    \n\n```\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[INFO] Total time:  5.765 s\n[INFO] Finished at: 2025-10-19T11:25:19+05:30\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[ERROR] Failed to execute goal on project login-portal-layouts: Could not resolve dependencies for project org.wso2.identity.apps:login-portal-layouts:jar:3.3.23-SNAPSHOT\n[ERROR] dependency: org.wso2.identity.apps:org.wso2.identity.apps.taglibs.layout.controller:jar:3.3.23-SNAPSHOT (compile)\n[ERROR]         org.wso2.identity.apps:org.wso2.identity.apps.taglibs.layout.controller:jar:3.3.23-SNAPSHOT was not found in https://maven.wso2.org/nexus/content/groups/wso2-public/ during a previous attempt.

Also, after the title, you focus on an invisible element before moving on to the card underneath.\n\nThis is probably because that is an editable field, but that isn't sufficiently obvious, so when hitting enter, the invisible field expands, without the user realising why.",

Seems to only happen when the 2nd tab is less than the max tab width or something like that.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Open first tab (e.g. `README.md`).\n2. Pin first tab.\n3. Open second tab (with a short filename, e.g. `.env`).\n\n**Expected Behavior**: Second tab width is stable.\n**Actual Behavior**: Second tab is stuck in a resize loop / constant flickering.\n\n\n### Zed Version and System Specs\n\nZed: v0.209.7 (Zed) \nOS: Linux Wayland fedora-asahi-remix 42\nMemory: 15.3 GiB\nArchitecture: aarch64\nGPU: Apple M2 (G14G B0) || Honeykrisp || Mesa 25.2.4",

      "description" : "Hi People,\r\n\r\ni am usually trying to install software without the need of Docker. But i gave up for Manyfold after nearly 10 hours of trial and error. Its just a bit hard. I wanted to ask this as feature request. Please add some howto for installing on fresh environment. For now, i moved to docker, but like to switch back.\r\n\r\nI am sharing my complete documentation for my process which failed at the end: EVERYTHING worked **except** the fact that uploaded files were not processed by Sidekiq, finally and sadly.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis documentation is for Version 0.90.2 with Ruby 3.3.6 - tested on an Ubuntu LTS 24\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Allgemeine Bibliotheken\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo apt install libarchive13t64 libglfw3 libpq-dev libmariadb-dev\r\n```\r\n\r\n### PostgreSQL Datenbank installieren  \r\n\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo apt install postgresql postgresql-client\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Datenbank und Nutzer erzeugen, Berechtigungen zum Schema hinzuf??gen\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo -u postgres psql #als eine Zeile!\r\nCREATE USER manyfold WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD_SEE_KEEPASS';\r\nCREATE DATABASE manyfold WITH ENCODING 'UNICODE' LC_COLLATE 'C' LC_CTYPE 'C' TEMPLATE template0;\r\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE manyfold TO manyfold;\r\n\r\n\\c manyfold\r\nGRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO manyfold;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Ruby Version Manager (RVM) installieren  \r\n\r\n\r\nManyfold ben??tigt eine passende Ruby-Version.

      "url" : "https://github.com/manyfold3d/manyfold/issues/3015",
      "repositoryName" : "manyfold3d/manyfold",
      "description" : "When signing in via a configured OIDC identity provider, if the account already exists extra caution should be applied. This is especially true for accounts with elevated privileges.\r\n\r\nWhen you allow automatic linking to existing accounts via an OIDC login, you then must fully trust the OIDC identity provider such that it won't automatically link a bad actors OIDC account to your login. Many IDP's should be safe and trusted, but if an identity provider allows changing a users email address for instance, and don't require verification to do so then this would allow a bad actor to simply login if they know the users email address and compromise the account.\r\n\r\nThis would likely become a larger issue especially when adding the ability to have multiple identity providers for supporting a use case of allowing social logins such as GitHub, Facebook, Google, etc broadly.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nAn authentication flow for linking _existing accounts_ exists.\r\n\r\n1. A user logins in via an Identity Provider with an account that matches an existing users email address (which appears to be the user id for Manyfold)\r\n2. User is presented with a request to login via their previously established credentials\r\n3. User is prompted to confirm the association of the Identity Providers account with their Manyfold user account.\r\n4. There is a visible way to determine if an account has linked accounts and from what Identity Provider(s).\r\n\r\nThis would then mean that identity providers would be less risky to trust as most of the identity providers you would want to use in a public instance would be third-party managed and by default they should not assume they are trustworthy to autolink. Even if they are trustworthy today, in the future their processes might change.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nA few existing self hosted applications I've seen recently already handle this in a variety of different ways.\r\n\r\n#### Miniflux\r\n\r\nAllows existing users to link to account only after they have logged in, this prevents this scenario since you would first have to currently have the accounts credentials to link an external authentication source (OIDC). When logging in via OIDC to an account that already exists, Miniflux presents an error: \"This user already exists.\"\r\n\r\nThe path to linking existing users is to...\r\n\r\n1. Login with existing credentials\r\n6. Use the linking account flow:\r\n    \r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d829d31f-fb94-4e67-8607-340bd19ffd6c)\r\n\r\nMiniflux then later gives you the ability to remove an association, but also being able to see that an external authentication exists.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69b134f2-11b0-4506-a24d-fcd579c8b6e3)\r\n\r\n#### Paperless-ngx\r\n\r\nSeems to have a very similar flow when comparing to Miniflux, except when you login via OIDC on Paperless-ngx, you are presented with a form to create an account with the data from OIDC:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7ac6dde-a248-48c5-aa35-8e416ee40f2c)\r\n\r\nWhen attempting to create a duplicate user account, using the same username as an already existing account, it provides an error:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42ec51ab-b7eb-4e29-b3a1-e103336e0c23)\r\n\r\nThe correct path within Paperless-ngx to associate an OIDC account to an existing account is to first login via existing credentials and follow a linking process:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d38c984-5313-4172-a053-dc1e6e7d876c)\r\n\r\nWhich then provides you a \"info screen\" about the step you are about to take:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e76ed210-8231-4bd5-ab5a-b81397e7ba54)\r\n\r\nAnd then once completed your profile shows the resulting linked account:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c69edfa3-976b-466f-8f22-230bb08953ba)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Photoprism\r\n\r\nThis application simply refuses to link existing accounts and will just create a new user for each OIDC user even if the preferred username matches an existing account. Instead it will add random numbers to the OIDC's preferred_username field, such as \"cereal522422\" instead of \"cereal\".\r\n\r\nIn order to link existing accounts, one must go to the existing user, select OIDC and enter the sub value for the Identity Provider and then the process will work. It's a bit cumbersome but it does work and existing users don't get autolinked.\r\n\r\n#### Others\r\n\r\nI'm sure there are others, but this is probably sufficient for starting this discussion / FR.\r\n\r\nAutolinking tends to give a variety of problems for trusting your Identity Provider, for my case, I'm running my own in which case I've disabled changing email addresses, so this isn't a problem for my configuration, but that might not be true for _all_ identity providers users configure especially not if support for multiple providers are offered in the future (which seems like a natural progression for allowing social authentication for a public instance).\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nOverall I thought that Paperless-ngx was probably the most complete of a solution, but ultimately any of the three examples in this FR prevented an Identity Provider to be a path for gaining access to an existing account without first verifying the user is actually authenticated via the original credentials (or in some cases, not even allowing a linking automatically).\r\n",

We might already be working on it :) https://github.com/manyfold3d/manyfold/labels/feature\n\nYou can also come and discuss ideas in our Feature Requests channel on Matrix: https://matrix.to/#/#manyfold:one.ems.host\n-->\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nThis is a nice to have feature. where when you are logged in as admin it would be amazing to have a notification even if it is where the version is in the footer of hey there is a updated version to your instance available.  This could be something as simple as this \n\nVersion: 0.99.1 (c4f9cf89) !update available \n\nOr we could expand it with \n\nVersion: 0.99.1 (c4f9cf89) !Version 0.102.2 is available for download\n\nThis maybe best if it is run as a job that runs like once a day or maybe every hour or 2 hours so it isnt hitting githubs servers checking on every page refresh and updates a table in the database and pull from there.\n\n**Additional context**\nhere would be the endpoint todo that can do this, with 0 being the newest release/tag\n\nhttps://api.github.com/repos/manyfold3d/manyfold/tags\n\nThere is also the https://docs.github.com/en/rest/releases/releases?apiVersion=2022-11-28 but it needs a Bearer token to use where as the tag endpoint doesnt.\n\nthis could also use ghcr.io for the container endpoint so it is on each type. but It appears to be needing a API key for this endpoint to work.
