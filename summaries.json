This made the Jupyter experience appear broken or incomplete, as users could see the results of IPython commands but not the commands themselves.\n\n## Environment\n\n- **OpenHands Version**: Latest (main branch)\n- **Runtime**: All runtimes with Jupyter support\n- **Browser**: All browsers\n- **Affected Component**: Frontend Jupyter tab\n\n## Bug Description\n\n### Expected Behavior\nThe Jupyter tab should display both:\n1. Input commands (the Python code being executed)\n2. Output results (the execution results)\n\n### Actual Behavior\nThe Jupyter tab only displayed:\n1. ??? Input commands: Missing\n2. ??? Output results: Working correctly\n\n### Impact\n- Users couldn't see what commands were being executed\n- Jupyter tab appeared broken or non-functional\n- Poor user experience for data analysis workflows\n- Made it difficult to understand the agent's Python code execution\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe issue was in the frontend action handling logic in `frontend/src/services/actions.ts`. The system was missing handling for `RUN_IPYTHON` actions to add input to the Jupyter state.\n\n**Missing Code:**\n```typescript\nif (message.action === ActionType.RUN_IPYTHON) {\n  store.dispatch(appendJupyterInput(message.args.code));\n}\n```\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Start OpenHands with Jupyter enabled\n2. Ask an agent to run Python code (e.g., \"Create a simple plot using matplotlib\")\n3. Navigate to the Jupyter tab\n4. Observe that only outputs are shown, not the input commands\n\n## Fix\n\nFixed in PR #9533\n\n## Labels\n\n- bug\n- frontend\n- jupyter\n- good first issue",

      "title" : "Databricks manifest path: ParseResult type causes invalid API request ??? requires string conversion",
      "url" : "https://github.com/nicholasyager/dbt-loom/issues/140",
      "repositoryName" : "nicholasyager/dbt-loom",
      "description" : "Hi, thank you very much for maintaining dbt-loom and for your continued work on this project!\n\nWe have encountered two main issues when using dbt-loom to load a manifest file from Databricks, and would like to suggest improvements that could make dbt-loom more robust and user-friendly for a wider range of Databricks setups:\n\n1. File paths are sometimes passed as `ParseResult` objects (from `urlparse`) instead of plain strings, which can lead to type errors such as `quote_from_bytes() expected bytes`.\n2. The current implementation does not distinguish between DBFS and Workspace file paths, always using `w.files.download()`. However, `/Workspace/...` paths are not supported by this method and require `w.workspace.export()` instead.\n\n## Context & Symptoms\n\n- If the manifest file path is a `ParseResult` and not converted to a string, a type error can occur, even for simple ASCII paths.\n- If the manifest is stored in the Databricks Workspace (not DBFS), using `w.files.download()` results in an error: `unsupported first path component: Workspace`.\n- These issues can cause file-not-found or type errors, regardless of the presence of special characters.\n\n## Root Causes\n\n1. **Type Handling:**\n   - Passing a `ParseResult` object instead of a string to file APIs causes type errors.\n2. **API Usage:**\n   - The code always uses `w.files.download()` for all paths, but Workspace files require `w.workspace.export()`.\n\n## Suggestions & Recommendations\n\n- **We recommend always converting the file path to a plain string before passing it to any API or file operation.**\n  - If the path is a `ParseResult`, please consider extracting and decoding the `.path` attribute using `unquote`.\n- **It would be helpful if dbt-loom could distinguish between DBFS and Workspace paths:**\n  - Use `w.files.download()` for DBFS paths (e.g., `/dbfs/...`).\n  - Use `w.workspace.export()` for Workspace paths (e.g., `/Workspace/...`).\n\nFor your reference, here is an example code snippet that implements these suggestions:\n\n```python\nfrom urllib.parse import ParseResult, unquote\n\ndef _get_path_str(self):\n    if isinstance(self.path, str):\n        return self.path\n    elif isinstance(self.path, ParseResult):\n        return unquote(self.path.path)\n    else:\n        raise TypeError(f\"Unsupported path type: {type(self.path)}\")\n\n# In load_manifest:\npath_str = self._get_path_str()\nif path_str.startswith(\"/Workspace/\"):\n    resp = w.workspace.export(path_str, format=ExportFormat.AUTO)\n    # ... handle base64 decode ...\nelse:\n    resp = w.files.download(path_str)\n    # ... handle DBFS file ...\n```\n\n## Potential Impact\n\n- We believe these changes would help dbt-loom reliably load manifest files from both DBFS and Workspace, regardless of the file path content.\n- This would prevent confusing type errors and file-not-found issues, and improve compatibility for all Databricks users.\n\n## Request\n\nWould you consider incorporating these improvements into dbt-loom? We believe this would make the tool even more robust and helpful for the community.\n\n---\n\n## Appendix: Working Example (`dbt_loom/clients/dbx.py`)\n\nBelow is the full code for `dbt_loom/clients/dbx.py` as used in my environment. With these changes, dbt-loom was able to load manifest files from  Workspace paths without issues.\n\n```python\nimport json\nimport gzip\nfrom io import BytesIO\nfrom typing import Dict\nfrom dbt_loom.logging import fire_event\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\nfrom urllib.parse import ParseResult, unquote\n\n\nclass DatabricksReferenceConfig(BaseModel):\n    \"\"\"Configuration for a reference stored in Databricks\"\"\"\n\n    path: str\n\n\nclass DatabricksClient:\n    \"\"\"A client for loading manifest files from Databricks.\"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, path: str) -> None:\n        self.path = path\n\n    def _get_path_str(self):\n        if isinstance(self.path, str):\n            return self.path\n        elif isinstance(self.path, ParseResult):\n            return unquote(self.path.path)\n        else:\n            raise TypeError(f\"Unsupported path type: {type(self.path)}\")\n\n    def load_manifest(self) -> Dict:\n        \"\"\"Load the manifest.json file from Databricks.\"\"\"\n        try:\n            from databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient\n            from databricks.sdk.service.workspace import ExportFormat\n            import base64\n        except ImportError:\n            fire_event(msg=\"dbt-loom expected the Databricks SDK to be installed.\")\n            raise\n\n        try:\n            w = WorkspaceClient()\n            path_str = self._get_path_str()\n            if path_str.startswith(\"/Workspace/\"):\n                resp = w.workspace.export(path_str, format=ExportFormat.AUTO)\n                content = resp.content\n                try:\n                    content = base64.b64decode(content).decode('utf-8')\n                except Exception:\n                    content = content.decode('utf-8') if isinstance(content, bytes) else content\n            else:\n                resp = w.files.download(path_str)\n                if path_str.endswith('.gz'):\n                    with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(resp.contents.read())) as gzipfile:\n                        content = gzipfile.read().decode('utf-8')\n                else:\n                    content = resp.contents.read()\n                    if isinstance(content, bytes):\n                        content = content.decode('utf-8')\n        except Exception:\n            fire_event(msg=\"Unable to retrieve file from Databricks.\")\n            raise\n\n        try:\n            return json.loads(content)\n        except json.decoder.JSONDecodeError:\n            fire_event(msg=f\"The object `{path_str}` does not contain valid JSON.\")\n            raise\n        except Exception:\n            fire_event(msg=f\"Unable to read the data contained in the object `{path_str}`\")\n            raise\n```\n\n## Environment\n\nThe following environment was used for testing and confirming the working example above:\n\n```\ndbt version: 1.9.8\npython version: 3.13.3\nos info: macOS-15.4.1-arm64-arm-64bit-Mach-O\nadapter type: databricks\nadapter version: 1.10.3\n```",

      "description" : "Currently in Bifrost, **each provider has a static configuration** for:\n\n* **Buffer sizes** (pending request queues)\n* **Worker pool sizes** (concurrent upstream request handlers)\n\nThis leads to two key problems:\n\n1. ?????? **Bottleneck under load:** If a large number of requests target a provider with small worker/buffer limits, it becomes a **throttle point**.\n2. ?????? **Wasted resources under-utilized:** If no traffic routes to a provider, its pre-allocated **memory and goroutines** sit idle.\n\n### ??? **Proposed Solution:**\n\nIntroduce **dynamic, runtime-adjustable scaling** of these resource allocations on a **per-provider** basis:\n\n#### Features:\n\n* **Auto-scaling** worker pool size based on real-time metrics:\n\n  * Request arrival rate\n  * Queue size thresholds\n  * Latency feedback loops (optional)\n* **Hot reloadable configuration:**\n\n  * Allow updating **buffer size** and **worker count** *without restarting Bifrost*.\n* **Optional static mode**:\n\n  * Per-provider option to **opt out** of dynamic scaling for predictable environments.\n\n#### Example Config (YAML):\n\n```yaml\nproviders:\n  - name: openai\n    dynamic_worker_scaling: true\n    min_workers: 4\n    max_workers: 100\n    scale_up_threshold: 70%  # when buffer usage exceeds 70%, add workers\n    scale_down_threshold: 20% # shrink pool if buffer usage drops below 20%\n```\n\n#### Real-time Adjustments:\n\n```\n[INFO] openai workers scaled up to 64 (buffer utilization: 85%)\n[INFO] openai workers scaled down to 16 (idle, low request rate)\n```\n\n### Why\n\n* ??? **Prevents provider bottlenecks during traffic spikes.**\n* ?????? **Optimizes memory and goroutine usage** during idle periods.\n* \uD83D\uDDA5??? Supports **production-grade, zero-downtime configuration changes**.",

      "description" : "### What happened?\n\nWhen a Kubernetes Pod defines resources.requests at the Pod level, but only specifies a subset of the supported resources requested by its containers (e.g., only cpu at the Pod level, while a container requests memory), Kubernetes' validation implicitly assigns a request of \"0\" for the unstated resource (e.g., memory) at the Pod level. This \"0\" value then triggers a validation error because it's less than the actual aggregated request from the containers, even though the user might expect the Pod to implicitly aggregate the container's memory request.\n\n```\n \"pod\" is invalid: spec.resources.requests[memory]: Invalid value: \"0\": must be greater than or equal to aggregate container requests of 10Mi\n```\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\nWhen a user defines resource requests at the container level, Kubernetes already aggregates these requests internally to determine the total resource needs of the Pod. If the Pod.spec.resources.requests field is present, but only specifies a subset of resources (e.g., cpu but not memory), the intuitive expectation is that Kubernetes would implicitly aggregate the memory request from the containers, rather than defaulting the Pod's memory request to 0.\n\nhttps://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/ccf291b50166ce82204486aae6a626a30b469182/pkg/apis/core/validation/validation.go#L4406 needs to be fixed to compare container aggregates with pod-level values only if pod-level value for that resource is set.\n\n### How can we reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)?\n\n\nEnable PodLevelResources feature gate on apiserver, scheduler and kubelet, and create the following pod\n```\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: pod-bug\nspec:\n  resources:\n    requests:\n      cpu: \"300m\"  # Pod-level CPU request\n  containers:\n  - name: sleep-infinity\n    image: busybox\n    command: [\"sh\", \"-c\", \"sleep infinity\"]\n    resources:\n      requests:\n        ephemeral-memory: 10Mi \n```\n\n### Anything else we need to know?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Kubernetes version\n\n<details>\n\n```console\n$ kubectl version\nClient Version: v1.33.1\nKustomize Version: v5.6.0\nServer Version: v1.33.1```\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Cloud provider\n\n<details>\nN/A\n</details>\n\n\n### OS version\n\n<details>\n\n```console\n# On Linux:\n$ cat /etc/os-release\n# paste output here\n$ uname -a\n# paste output here\n\n# On Windows:\nC:\\> wmic os get Caption, Version, BuildNumber, OSArchitecture\n# paste output here\n```\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Install tools\n\n<details>\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Container runtime (CRI) and version (if applicable)\n\n<details>\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Related plugins (CNI, CSI, ...) and versions (if applicable)\n\n<details>\n\n</details>\n",

Even though the default value of device_map is None as it is an Optional argument, as shown in the Transformers documentation https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained.device_map , I would say that the argument should explicitly be set to correspond to the current documentation.\n\n**What is the proposed change**\n```python\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=\"auto\", device_map=None)\n```\n",

      "description" : "<!--\nThank you for suggesting a new recipe for OpenRewrite!\nFeel free to delete any sections that don't apply to your request.\n-->\n\n## What problem are you trying to solve?\n\nGradle recommends using lazy task registration (tasks.register(...)) over eager task creation (task ...) to avoid unnecessary initialization during the configuration phase, which can improve build performance and is better aligned with modern Gradle best practices. IntelliJ IDEA does offer autofix suggestions for this change, but only on a per-line basis???mass cleanup across a project is not supported via code suggestions.\n\n## What precondition(s) should be checked before applying this recipe?\n\nNone???this change can be applied universally across all Gradle versions that support the tasks.register(...) syntax.\n\n## Describe the situation before applying the recipe\n\n```groovy\ntask allDeps(type: DependencyReportTask)\n```\n\nor\n\n```groovy\ntask allDeps(type: DependencyReportTask) { \n     group = 'reporting'\n     description = '...'\n     // additional configuration\n}\n```\n\n## Describe the situation after applying the recipe\n\n```groovy\ntasks.register(\"allDeps\", DependencyReportTask)\n```\n\nor\n\n```groovy\ntasks.register(\"allDeps\", DependencyReportTask) { \n     group = 'reporting'\n     description = '...'\n     // additional configuration\n}\n```\n\n## Have you considered any alternatives or workarounds?\n\nThis can be done manually or line-by-line using IntelliJ's quick fixes, but there is currently no automated way to perform this change across an entire codebase or multiple projects.\n\n## Any additional context\n\nThis change aligns with modern Gradle practices. While IntelliJ offers autofixes for single lines, a recipe in OpenRewrite would enable automated and large-scale migration of legacy Gradle scripts to use lazy task registration. It should be relatively straightforward to implement when needed.\n\n## Are you interested in [contributing this recipe to OpenRewrite](https://github.com/openrewrite/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-new-recipes)?\n\nNot at this time, unless prompted by customer need.\n",

      "description" : "### Link to the Page\n\nhttps://www.skeleton.dev/docs/tailwind/buttons\n\n### Describe the Issue (screenshots encouraged!)\n\nCurrently we showcase icons buttons as a button element wrapping an icon. But we should also encourage best practices when it comes to a11y and include an `aria-label` field for these that describes the purpose of the button to end users. This can come in the form of a `aria-label` and `title` attributes:\n\n### What to Change\n\nBefore:\n\n```html\n<button type=\"button\" class=\"btn-icon preset-filled\"><IconArrowRight size={18} /></button>\n```\n\nAfter:\n\n```html\n<button type=\"button\" class=\"btn-icon preset-filled\" title=\"Go\" aria-label=\"Go\">\n    <IconArrowRight size={18} />\n</button>\n```\n\nAdditionally we should scan all portions of our applications (docs + theme generator) for instances of `btn-icon` and append these attributes accordingly, so we're practicing what we preach.\n\n---\n\n> NOTE: there *may* be icon buttons used within components, in that case we'll need to add new props to said components to allow for proper i18n translations. These should be documented in a new/standalone issue as a separate follow up task. This will be out of scope of this ticket.",

The problem is that Airflow logs errors when a variable is not found, even if a default is provided.\n\nIn our use case, we have 100+ DAGs and use variables to configure schedules for them, so variables are read during DAG loading. This leads to significant error log spam that is picked up by Sentry. It's possible to work around this with custom logging filters, but I believe using the error log level is suboptimal and should be changed in Airflow core, especially considering `Variable.get` supports the \"default\" kwarg.\n\n### Related issues\n\n_No response_\n\n### Are you willing to submit a PR?\n\n- [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n",

The directory includes artifacts that meet the CR requirements, along with PGP signatures for every file. I'm fairly sure, given the actual error below, that the artifacts themselves don't matter.\n\nI have the following `jreleaser.toml`:\n\n```\n[deploy.maven.mavenCentral.sonatype]\nactive = \"ALWAYS\"\nsign = false\nurl = \"https://central.sonatype.com/api/v1/publisher\"\nstagingRepositories = [\"build/maven\"]\n```\n\nI run jreleaser:\n\n```\n$ env \\\nJRELEASER_MAVENCENTRAL_USERNAME=\"${MAVEN_CENTRAL_USERNAME}\" \\\nJRELEASER_MAVENCENTRAL_PASSWORD=\"${MAVEN_CENTRAL_PASSWORD}\" \\\nJRELEASER_PROJECT_JAVA_GROUP_ID=\"${JRELEASER_PROJECT_JAVA_GROUP_ID}\" \\\nJRELEASER_PROJECT_VERSION=\"${JRELEASER_PROJECT_VERSION}\" \\\n./jreleaser deploy --config-file=jreleaser.toml\n```\n\n### Expected Behaviour\n\nI'd expect to see `jreleaser` create a bundle and deploy it to Maven Central.\n\n### Actual Behaviour\n\n```\n[INFO]  JReleaser

If you want to work on one, check the open PR list to see if someone has already done it, then just send a PR directly (but stick to one notebook per PR).\n\nAnd here's the migration guide: https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/migrate",

For example, in [Prompting.ipynb](https://github.com/KSruthiVel/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Prompting.ipynb)\n\n```python\nmodel = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-2.0-flash')\nchat = model.start_chat(history=[])\n```\n\nWith `google-genai`, `start_chat()` does not seem to keep track of previous exchanges. Instead, it looks like we now need to manually store and pass chat history with each request.\n\nTo address this, I plan to store chat history as a list of dictionaries, where each entry contains a role (\"user\" or \"model\") and the message content. The model???s response is then appended back to the list to ensure continuity in future exchanges.\n\nCan you confirm if this is the correct approach, or is there a recommended way to handle chat history in `google-genai`?\n\nThank you!", "I also got confused at first but there's still a way to get the history.

      "repositoryName" : "camunda/camunda",
      "description" : "## Description  \n\nCurrently, we do not publish SNAPSHOT images for our stable branches. Having these available would allow QA to run nightly cross-component tests against the stable heads. In the future, this would also enable running new E2E smoke tests, reducing friction due to integration testing at release time and potentially cutting down on most of the manual testing required during a release.  \n\nThe `stable/8.7` branch already has a SNAPSHOT image due to the new dual 8.7 and 8.8 release strategy, but this was implemented as a one-off and uses the discouraged `8.7.0-SNAPSHOT` naming. This ticket aims to extend that approach to all stable branches, ensuring that every supported version has a corresponding SNAPSHOT image available for testing.\n\n## Expected Outcome  \n\n- Each stable branch (e.g., `stable/8.6`, `stable/8.7`, etc.) has a corresponding `X.Y-SNAPSHOT` image published for each component present on that branch:\n    - 8.5 and older only have Zeebe component\n- Images follow a predictable naming convention (e.g., `8.6-SNAPSHOT`, `8.7-SNAPSHOT`).  \n- The images [are documented](https://github.com/camunda/camunda/wiki/CI-&-Automation#available-snapshot-artifacts) for reference.  \n- The CI pipeline builds and publishes these images automatically.  \n- The approach is sustainable for future versions (align the existing implementation of `stable/8.7` branch with how it's done on all other branches).\n\n## Open Questions\n\n- What were the previous blockers to implementing this for all stable branches?\n- Are there any concerns regarding support for these images?\n- Should each product team handle their own SNAPSHOT builds, or should Infra own this process?\n\n## Related Discussions\n\n- [Slack conversation from March 19???25, 2025](https://camunda.slack.com/archives/C071KP5BTHB/p1742395590166449) (internal discussion on why we need stable SNAPSHOT images and how they would benefit QA).  \n- Reference implementation for `stable/8.7` ([GitHub Issue #27193](https://github.com/camunda/camunda/issues/27193)).  \n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Confirm the technical feasibility of extending the current `8.7-SNAPSHOT` implementation to all stable branches.\n2. Align on ownership (Monorepo Devops team vs. product teams).  \n3. Update the CI configuration to generate and publish the images.  \n4. Document the availability and usage of these images.  \n",

As we discussed today, this task will be the next one I???ll pick up. I???ll reach out to you soon to gather more information once I have some time to focus on it.", "Hi @slolatte! \n\nBefore I move forward with the implementation, I???d like to confirm my understanding of the goals and surface a few clarifying questions to ensure we???re aligned on scope, naming, and process.\n\n## Understanding of the Goal\n\nThe core objective is to publish Docker images tagged as `X.Y-SNAPSHOT` (e.g., 8.7-SNAPSHOT, 8.6-SNAPSHOT) for each supported stable branch in the monorepo, so they can be consumed by:\n\n- QA's nightly cross-component testing\n- Future E2E smoke tests during the release cycle\n\nThere???s already a one-off implementation for stable/8.7 that publishes a `8.7.0-SNAPSHOT` image, and I understand this:\n\n- Includes Git commit metadata in the image (e.g., via git.properties or /actuator/info)\n- Need to be improved by removing the patch-level naming (X.Y.Z-SNAPSHOT), which we now want to avoid\n\n## Plan Going Forward\n\n- [x] Replace X.Y.Z-SNAPSHOT docker tag with a standardized branch-level X.Y-SNAPSHOT tag\n- [ ] Ensure images are published on every merge to a stable branch (TBD)\n- [x] Maintain commit metadata in the image for traceability\n\n## Questions / Clarifications\n\n1. Just confirming that `X.Y-SNAPSHOT` is solely a Docker image tag, and has no relation to Maven Central SNAPSHOT artifacts, correct?\n2. Is this currently limited to the monorepo (e.g., Zeebe, Modeler, etc.), or are other components like Optimize, etc. expected to follow the same approach for their own `stable/X.Y` branches?\n3. Should a new `X.Y-SNAPSHOT` image be published:\n   a. Every time a PR is merged into a stable branch?\n   b. Or on a nightly schedule only?\n4. What should happen to the previous `X.Y-SNAPSHOT` image when a new one is published?\n   a. Should it be overwritten/replaced immediately?\n   b. Should we retain previous images for some period (e.g., to avoid breaking a test in progress)?\n   c. If a new image is pushed while QA is running a test on the same `X.Y-SNAPSHOT` tag, is there any expected coordination?\n   d. Should we assume ???latest image wins???, and the next test will simply consume whatever???s available at the time?\n   e. Do we need stability guarantees per test run (e.g., lock to the SHA/tag used at test start)?\n\nThanks in advance for the help!", "I can give input on some of the questions from my POV:\n\n> 1. Just confirming that X.Y-SNAPSHOT is solely a Docker image tag, and has no relation to Maven Central SNAPSHOT artifacts, correct?\n\nYup\n\n> 2. Is this currently limited to the monorepo (e.g., Zeebe, Modeler, etc.), or are other components like Optimize\n\nOptimize is part of the monorepo on newer versions (8.8+), hence the phrasing in the ticket description:\n\n>> Each stable branch (e.g., stable/8.6, stable/8.7, etc.) has a corresponding X.Y-SNAPSHOT image published for each component present on that branch:\n>>   * 8.5 and older only have Zeebe component\n\n> 3. a. Every time a PR is merged (_a commit is pushed_) into a stable branch?\n\nThat would be in line how we do it for `main` (and people expect it to work like that here) and `stable/8.7` so I'd appreciate the consistency and staying with the people's expectations.\n\n> 4. a. Should it be overwritten/replaced immediately?\n\nAgain yes from my side, since I'd appreciate that to have consistency with how `main` does it (and people expect it to work)\n\n> 4. c. If a new image is pushed while QA is running a test on the same X.Y-SNAPSHOT tag, is there any expected coordination?\n\nDocker caches images locally (on the same GHA run+runner only) so overwriting images in an upstream Docker registry is usually not breaking.", "I agree with all of @cmur2 comments and just to add to that from a QA POV we don't need to retain previous images for any period nor do we need stability guarantees per test run.

Yes we should definitly leave the get_uri method as it is (not get_url as it doesn???t exist yet) and implement a new get_url method which would then be called by the existing get_sqlalchemy_engine.\r\n\r\nYes, adding new method is the way to go. How to do it, should be proposed and discussed in the PR, we have 20+ sql providers, and I think the proposal should be complete and explain how to deal with cases that can/cannot be mapped. Also the method should explicily - IMHO - call our sqlalachemy, (`getSqlAlchemyURI` ?) and likely allow variations - from what I understand SQLAlchemy can have different URLs not only for different databases, but also for different drivers. Also some of our Connections allows to add different kinds of extras and parameters - not only hosts but other parameters that might be used and passed differently to different drivers.\r\n\r\nIf we decide to introduce a new \"standard\" method, in a product like Airflow and common API like DBApiHook, the proposal should provide answers to all the questions that users might ask in order to be mergable. It does not have to handle all of those but at least get enough error handlling and interface specification to explain what is the transition from the Connection form (in all those cases we have DBAPI implementation) -> SQLAlchemy URL.  Which variations are handled, how it should work, how to map engine args etc. \r\n\r\nI don't think it can be handled by a single implementation, it's more a scaffloiding + implementation for all the implementations and it should be designed nicely with al least a handful (if not all) implementation from the above list to be quite sure that we will be able to handle those cases. \r\n", "\r\n> Hey Andrey think there is some confusion here.

As I understand it, actually supporting the \"%\" form is less important to you than having the chart and the CRD be consistent, correct?", "It would be ideal to be able to use % so we don't have to change the value for `maxUnavailable` as we increase or decrease the number of replicas.  However, if % isn't going to be supported at injection time, the helm chart should not support it either so it's more consistent with a \"fail-fast\" paradigm.", "This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity. It will be closed in 14 days if no further activity occurs. Thank you for your contributions.\n", "I would like to provide a fix for this issue. My idea is to change the maxUnavailable to type IntOrString, like for the [PodDisruptionBudget type](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/dc19f0b6b9cd14ece6b1929cb4e7ea2c9d322b95/pkg/apis/policy/types.go#L43). Why do you think about that @alpeb? \n\nAlso for testing, do I need to generate a new type of golden file and test to cover the % or is there a better alternative?", "Thanks for taking this on, @wim-de-groot! Unfortunately, `values.go` is a bit of debt in the codebase. It's been a challenge to keep this typed go struct in sync with the `values.yml` used by the Helm charts and by the chart rendering done by the Linkerd CLI.  The only reason we keep it around is because setting fields into a typed go struct is more ergonomic than setting fields (especially deeply nested fields) into an untyped `map[string]interface{}`.\n\nWith that said, there's actually nowhere in our go codebase that we specifically set `maxUnavailable` so I think we can sidestep this issue by making the `Controller` field of the `Values` struct at `map[string]interface{}`.  You can see that we do the same thing for  `DeploymentStrategy` and follow that as an example.\n\nUpdating an existing test or adding a new one where we set a % based PDB in the values would be a good way to test this.", "I set the default value of the `controller.podDisruptionBudget.maxUnavailable` to 25% instead of just 1. Its the same as for `deploymentStrategy`. I'am not sure if this is desirable, please let me know." ],

As part of that experience, I and @Johansmm would like to suggest a few optimization patterns that could improve performance and simplify common model graphs. These are generally applicable across many models:\n \n1. Fold `BatchNormalization` into preceding nodes (`Conv`, `ConvTranspose`, `Gemm`) https://github.com/microsoft/onnxscript/pull/2312\n2. Fuse `MatMul + Add` into `Gemm` https://github.com/microsoft/onnxscript/pull/2356\n3. Fuse `Min + Max` into `Clip`\n4. Eliminate redundant `Reshape` / `Flatten` nodes\n5. Fold `Pad` into `Conv` / `ConvInteger` https://github.com/microsoft/onnxscript/pull/2363\n6. Fuse successive `Clip` / `ReLU` nodes https://github.com/microsoft/onnxscript/pull/2410\n \nWe're happy to contribute if any of these are a good fit.

I noticed that the scroll wheel behavior is significantly different.\r\n\r\nIn the new architecture (Windows App SDK), scrolling with a mouse wheel feels much less responsive. The number of lines scrolled per wheel notch is considerably smaller compared to both the React Native Windows Gallery app and the official WinUI 3 Gallery app. As a result, scrolling through content feels sluggish and requires much more effort from the user.\r\n\r\nThis issue makes basic interaction in list views and scrollable content frustrating. \r\n\r\nAny helps?

We just display the price and so on.\n- We should display the category (mandatory), the origins (optional), the labels (optional) and the \"price per\" (unit/kg) (mandatory)\n\n### Steps to reproduce the behavior\n1.

This behaviour is nice because it still compute the brier score for the estimator for which it is relevant.\n\nHowever, the problem occurs if we pass explicitely the metric:\n\n```python\nreport.metrics.brier_score(scoring=[\"brier_score\"])\n```\n\nIt will raise the following error:\n\n```pytb\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)\nFile [~/Documents/scikit-learn-workspace/src/skore/.pixi/envs/dev/lib/python3.12/site-packages/sklearn/utils/_available_if.py:32](http://localhost:8888/~/Documents/scikit-learn-workspace/src/skore/.pixi/envs/dev/lib/python3.12/site-packages/sklearn/utils/_available_if.py#line=31), in _AvailableIfDescriptor._check(self, obj, owner)\n     31 try:\n---> 32     check_result = self.check(obj)\n     33 except Exception as e:\n\nFile [~/Documents/scikit-learn-workspace/src/skore/skore/skore/src/skore/utils/_accessor.py:9](http://localhost:8888/~/Documents/scikit-learn-workspace/src/skore/skore/skore/src/skore/utils/_accessor.py#line=8), in _check_all_checks.<locals>.check(accessor)\n      8 def check(accessor: Any) -> bool:\n----> 9     return all(check(accessor) for check in checks)\n\nFile [~/Documents/scikit-learn-workspace/src/skore/skore/skore/src/skore/utils/_accessor.py:9](http://localhost:8888/~/Documents/scikit-learn-workspace/src/skore/skore/skore/src/skore/utils/_accessor.py#line=8), in <genexpr>(.0)\n      8 def check(accessor: Any) -> bool:\n----> 9     return all(check(accessor) for check in checks)\n\nFile [~/Documents/scikit-learn-workspace/src/skore/skore/skore/src/skore/utils/_accessor.py:43](http://localhost:8888/~/Documents/scikit-learn-workspace/src/skore/skore/skore/src/skore/utils/_accessor.py#line=42), in _check_estimator_has_method.<locals>.check(accessor)\n     41     return True\n---> 43 raise AttributeError(\n     44     f\"Estimator {parent_estimator} is not a supported estimator by \"\n     45     f\"the function called.

When we detect a folds strategy, then the legend report \"fold #n\" otherwise, we report \"split #n\"?", "My point is that we should have something consistant between the .frame and the .plot. That's actually my only request, so we should have the same naming strategy. I don't mind the \"long\" string for column name.

If you place the arc end/start point just on the external arc, does it work?", "@maxwxyz using only the start / end points creates an underconstrained arc because the radius is not defined. A workaround is to use the start/end points and then apply an equality constraint on the external arc and the sketch's arc, which could be easily automated or if the implementation of the over-constrained checker allows it, ignored.\r\n\r\nI think, still the cleanest solution would be pulling external geometry as part of the working geometry of the sketch, rendering them with purple continuous line to indicate they are external.", "I would consider this an outright bug. The arc is defined by 3 points: center and start and end points on the curve. If you match all three points, the sketcher reports \"redundant constraint\" for one of the points on the arc, if that constraint is removed the arc is underconstrained. The equality of the arc to the external geometry is not sufficient, since equality only defines a radius and does not fully constrain the arc. \r\n\r\nThe problem example is attached.\r\n\r\n[constrain_arc_bug.FCStd.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17436693/constrain_arc_bug.FCStd.zip)", "To emphasize why I consider it a bug - the arc is defined by a minimum of 3 points. Using those three points is \"redundant constraint\", which is wrong - there is no excess constraint. Removing the \"redundancy\" does not fully define the arc.", "Testing this on commit `38806`, the third coincidence constraint get's removed by `void removeRedundantAutoConstraints()`, making the arc underconstrained.\nNot making this issue solved but changing the behavior.\n\nI can also reach the error `Autoconstraints cause conflicting constraints - Please report!` from :\nhttps://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/blob/29ea277b3ba4f38ce7dd0a51ca0d4e6e03b65cf2/src/Mod/Sketcher/Gui/DrawSketchDefaultHandler.h#L991-L998\n\nBy doing an arc on a rounded rectangle's corner. With the attached file, on the corner away from the origin.\n[ConstraintError.FCStd.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18546534/ConstraintError.FCStd.zip)", "This is definitely a bug. Setting the two end points and center point coincident with the external geometry arc flags as over-constrained. This is the most straightforward workflow (besides allowing users to turn external geometry into solid lines).\n\nSomewhat comically, if you ask gemini 2.5 how to correctly constrain an arc to an external geometry arc, in FreeCAD, it will ask you to do exactly what I described. After telling it this results in over-constraint it gets really confused and starts trying to debug what you did wrong lol.\n\nThe current work around is as suggested above. Set the end points to be coincident and then set an equality constraint between the two arcs. This is less intuitive than constraining the points to coincident." ],

Please describe.\n\nAs a data scientist, I would like to see if my model is overfitting or not, by comparing the score of my model on the train set and on the test set.\n\nAs of v0.9.1, to get the summary of metrics on the test set, I can do:\n```python\nfrom sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import Ridge\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom skore import EstimatorReport\n\nX, y = fetch_california_housing(return_X_y=True, as_frame=True)\n\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=0)\n\nridge_report = EstimatorReport(\n    make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), Ridge()),\n    X_train=X_train,\n    X_test=X_test,\n    y_train=y_train,\n    y_test=y_test,\n)\n\nridge_report.metrics.summarize().frame()  # default on test\n```\nand for the train:\n```python\nridge_report.metrics.summarize(data_source=\"train\").frame() \n```\nBut I can't have both the train and test sets on the same dataframe.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nHave something like:\n```python\nridge_report.metrics.summarize(data_source=\"all\").frame()\n```\nfor both train and test sets, which would return this kind of dataframe:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2dab250-c375-4fc2-a224-ba1e31d72575)\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered, if relevant\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

I would love to be proven wrong). We would need to migrate to a self-hosted git server to do that. So, cool idea, but not happening.\r\n\r\nAdding a check to CI is the only possibility I can think of. This isn't ideal because we're using a shared repo (instead of keeping separate personal forks) so once a problem file hits CI it's already in the repo and will affect everyone. But we can make it choke if your branch introduces (or has? subtle distinction) a large file in it, and have it tell you to rebase it away.\r\n\r\nOnce a file is rebased away (and it has to be [truly gone](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository) -- from all branches and the `reflog` too and everyone's local copies) then `git gc` should clean it up. There's built in grace periods so it will take a while -- up to a month -- to naturally delete, but you can override them with `git reflog expire --expire=now --all` and `git gc --prune=now` and hopefully if you introduce a problem file CI can catch it before any one else checks out the branch.\r\n\r\nAdding a check in Github Actions might be even better, because github actions can run on all sorts of events; it would be ideal if an Action would let us reject a push.\r\n\r\n", "I'm very pro the Actions workflow method!

(Look for the [removal of `im_weight`](https://github.com/spinalcordtoolbox/spinalcordtoolbox/pull/2115/files#r1083320059) from the `extract_metric` function.) \r\n\r\nSince that PR, there have been two additional \"cleanup\" PRs:\r\n\r\n1. [#2291](https://github.com/spinalcordtoolbox/spinalcordtoolbox/pull/2291) (Specifically https://github.com/spinalcordtoolbox/spinalcordtoolbox/pull/2291/commits/59a6f0fd76a93ad059cfc5507b070933a3153a75)\r\n2.

However, even with the two cleanups, the actual CLI flag `-mask-weighted` was never removed. So, we were left with a CLI option that does nothing.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI think we have two options:\r\n\r\n- Remove the dead CLI options (since there has been no internal functionality for this for over 3 years now)\r\n- Re-implement the functionality entirely from scratch\r\n\r\nThe first option seems the most reasonable to me in the short term? Since adding new functionality to the `aggregate_metric` API is precarious at the moment (see https://github.com/spinalcordtoolbox/spinalcordtoolbox/issues/4005).", "> Remove the dead CLI options (since there has been no internal functionality for this for over 3 years now)\r\n\r\n\uD83D\uDC4D " ],

Could you please clear up the tasks involved here, it would really help here?\nThanks", "Where was the instability typically? In #441 I saw that it was a OOM error.\n\nI think I've identified the location/possible fix for the OOM error, the [`create_masked_array`](https://github.com/brainglobe/brainglobe-atlasapi/blob/70c4338a46e89b4039be706aab4bc768eba9418c/brainglobe_atlasapi/atlas_generation/volume_utils.py#L10) function currently creates a copy of the entire annotation array for each mask that's being generated. So if the annotation array is ~4 GB in memory and it's using 30 cores, it could easily use up to 120 GB in RAM. I propose extracting \"sub-volumes\" that will be used to create the meshes. I've tested the below code generating the `eurasian_blackcap_25um` atlas, and the peak RAM use drops from ~20 GB to 10 GB when parallelised across 30 cores.\n\n```\nbuffer = 15\nmatching_indices = np.argwhere(np.isin(volume, label))\n\n# Determine the bounding box\nmin_coords = matching_indices.min(axis=0) - buffer\nmax_coords = matching_indices.max(axis=0) + buffer\n# Ensure coordinates are within bounds\nmin_coords = np.maximum(min_coords, 0)\nmax_coords = np.minimum(max_coords, volume.shape)\n\nsub_volume = volume[\nmin_coords[0]:max_coords[0],\nmin_coords[1]:max_coords[1],\nmin_coords[2]:max_coords[2]\n]\narr = np.zeros_like(sub_volume)\nif not greater_than:\n    arr[np.isin(sub_volume, label)] = 1\nelse:\n    arr[sub_volume > label] = 1\n```", "The resulting meshes would need to be corrected though right, to put them back into the correct space?", "They would, it seems I tested visualising the outputs after running it without extracting subvolumes \uD83D\uDE05. This solution also wasn't scaling when I tried running `kim_dev_mouse.py`. The memory usage still spikes to 80+ GB when creating meshes for P04 onwards. " ],

      "description" : "### Describe the bug\n\nThe `-remoteWrite.retryMaxTime` flag in vmagent does not behave as its name implies. Based on the original intent in https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/6289 and the way similar functionality is implemented in `vmalert`, this flag was meant to control the **maximum interval between retry attempts** for failed remote write requests.\n\nHowever, the current flag name suggests **the maximum total duration spent retrying a failed request**, which is misleading and contradicts both the original intent and user expectations.\n\nProposed Changes:\n- Deprecate the `-remoteWrite.retryMaxTime` flag due to its ambiguous and misleading naming.\n- Introduce a new flag: `-remoteWrite.retryMaxInterval` that clearly communicates its purpose and aligns with `vmalert` flags.\n- Log a warning when the deprecated flag is used to inform users about the change.\n\n\nThe issue was originally found during discussion in https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8982#issuecomment-2922155441\n\n### To Reproduce\n\nFlag definition:\nhttps://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/208515dc38242c250d94e28e73045c9d446a6086/app/vmagent/remotewrite/client.go#L42\n\nFlag usage:\nhttps://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/208515dc38242c250d94e28e73045c9d446a6086/app/vmagent/remotewrite/client.go#L528\n\n\n### Version\n\nSince https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.103.0 where https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/6289 was introduced\n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Used command-line flags\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_",

At some points I went to the code to better understand some things that were not clear to me, but 95% was me *trusting* that the documentation is up to date with the implementation.\r\n- [ ] Reviewing the current definitions. Maybe not thoroughly, but I don't use the whole range of OpenSeadragon features, so there are things I might have missed:\r\n    - [ ] There are a lot of methods/constructors with optional parameters, which in my head translates to several function signatures. I tried to include as many supported signatures in the definition file, but some may be missing.\r\n    - [ ] I don't consider myself the greatest js developer in the world, so feedback is welcome.

This is available from the page menu button on the left side of the location bar. I personally forget it exists, but it is a no-code solution. It also scales the artwork like the comment icons down the right side, which look a little too puffy after I go up one notch.\r\n\r\nBefore, 100%:\r\n\r\n![before](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2d81706-14e0-47f8-a77d-a59fa01b5420)\r\n\r\nAfter, 115%:\r\n\r\n![after](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7b7da7a-f55f-4292-a386-fa7655247e86)\r\n\r\nAn option we could consider is to apply the user's system text size setting, which is at least possible on iPhone. [Craig Hockenberry explains how to use it in CSS](https://furbo.org/2024/07/04/dynamic-type-on-the-web/). Android also has such a setting, so I wonder if browsers can offer that to pages or if they do it automatically. This would be really nice, but only after bringing text size in line with common body text.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: I set my system text size up to 120%, so lots of sites' text looks small to me. However, text on Lobsters looks smaller than most.", "@pushcx I'm starting work on this. My proposed solution is to make the entire div which covers the both the arrow and the score clickable. That combined area is about 30px which is good enough, in contrast to the arrow alone which is 18px.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that anyone who clicks on that area wants to make a vote so it'll not obstruct any other user actions. I'll send a PR soon.", "That sounds like a great approach, I look forward to your PR. I think you'll have to make the `div` and `a` to keep it working without javascript.", "This [article on accessible fonts](https://accessibe.com/blog/knowledgebase/ada-compliant-fonts#character-size) recommends \"A safe bet for a WCAG-conforming font size is 16px (or [1em](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/em) or [1rem](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/css-rem))\". (thanks to gj1118 on [today's office hours stream](https://push.cx/stream/2025-03-24))\n\nSimilar to how we have CSS variables for colors we reuse, we should define variables for our [font size scale](https://webtypography.net/3.1.1). The most important text on the site is the comment text, so we should pick a good size for that and pick every other size as a variation on it (headlines, bylines, header/footer, etc).\n\n@holsta suggested a quick experiement, we removed all the `font-size` declarations, most of the `line-height`, and the `.comment_text p { padding }` and the resulting page looked quite good. There's enough variation in color and spacing that the site structure was still obvious. \n\nThinking of #642 I tried moving the `comment_folder` underneath the score - the change is a bit jarring, but I think it could become comfortable with experience, it sort of fits semantically as a replacement for downvote, and it reclaims horizontal space that's especially precious on mobile.", "> The most important text on the site is the comment text, so we should pick a good size for that and pick every other size as a variation on it (headlines, bylines, header/footer, etc).\n\nI believe the most accessible and user-friendly option is to let the user dictate their preferred font size. As long as `font-size` isn't overwritten in the root element, rem units respect the browser setting for default font size. Comment text should probably have a size of 1rem while other text elements could have some other multiple of rem.\n\nThis [article on CSS units](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/surprising-truth-about-pixels-and-accessibility/) does a good job of explaining the issue, and it also presents some solutions to help adapt to rem units.", "That sounds entirely reasonable.\n\nI did an experiment on an office hours stream a little while ago (no link handy, sorry) where I just deleted every `font-size` from the css and the site looked quite good! We don't use many variations in font size, and the ones we have may not communicate much." ],

      "description" : "The MinMaxScaler estimator scales the data to a range set by the minimum and maximum. Use the IncrementalBasicStatistics \nestimator to generate the min and max to scale the data. Investigate where the new implementation may be low performance and \ninclude guards in the code to use Scikit-learn as necessary. The final deliverable would be to add this estimator to the 'spmd'\ninterfaces which are effective on MPI-enabled supercomputers, this will use the underlying MPI-enabled minimum and maximum\ncalculators in IncrementalBasicStatistics. This is similar to the MaxAbsScaler and can be combined into a small project.\nThis is an easy difficulty project.\n\nhttps://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html",

After reviewing the estimated time commitment and the scope of work, I???ve realized that I may not be able to dedicate the 90 hours required at the moment, especially with this being my first contribution. I???d rather not commit unless I can give it the attention it deserves.\n\nI???ll definitely be keeping an eye on the project. I hope to circle back and contribute in the future when I can better manage the time and complexity." ],

When you then click the Restore Defaults icon it doesn't reset the value, and the Restore Defaults icon erroneously stays on.\n\nHowever, I believe this issue considers the default disabled (the toggle is gray) and would like to reset it to 0 as if the default was 0, basically making the UI opinonated on this value. \n\nBoth should be simple to address in a PR but I want to make sure both are needed, or just one.", "In my opinion, it should default to 0 when not specified. A lot of models (at least with SDXL ones I've used) produce odd results with it on, and so I would expect that in most cases it is detrimental to use unless explicitly set.\nJust my 2 cents though.", "Thanks @CubeTheThird. That's what I was assuming, but as I was exploring this area I noticed the other bug (due to a JS truthiness check that is equating 0 with false), so I wanted to make sure it wasn't instead that bug that needed to be updated. From what I see in the code both should be very simple to fix so I'll try to have a PR here soon." ],

And the definition would be `int getc(FILE* stream);`\n- It sounds like that `FILE` handle could be possibly either file or UART handle?", "> * Guess the `getc()` implementation would go under libc/minimal.\n\nYes, if it is only used by minimal libc. If it's going to be shared by other libc then probably `lib/libc/common`\n\n> And the definition would be `int getc(FILE* stream);`\n\nYes, you can read more about the definition here: https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/io/fgetc\n\n> * It sounds like that `FILE` handle could be possibly either file or UART handle?\n\nAnything that can be read from or written to can be abstracted as a 'FILE'\n\n", "Sounds good.", "I'm thinking to design and implement `getc()` using the same pattern as `putc()`. The design patten used for `putc()` leverages hooks(`_stdout_hook` for output) to abstract platform-specific behaviors. Similarly, `getc()` can use a `_stdin_hook` mechanism for input." ],

Possible Implementation\r\n\r\nPlaces in the code that use `EntityRefLink`/`EntityRefLinks` are already covered.\r\n\r\nBut there's still a fair number of places that just plain render `metadata.name`, or use `humanizeEntityRef`, or use some custom logic like that. Those should generally try to use the `EntityDisplayName` React component if possible, or use `EntityPresentation.promise` when in non-React code (which becomes available after #24595 is merged).\r\n\r\nWe'd appreciate the help with digging through the Backstage core and plugins, finding places where the presentation API should be used.\r\n\r\n### \uD83D\uDC40 Have you spent some time to check if this feature request has been raised before?\r\n\r\n- [X] I checked and didn't find similar issue\r\n\r\n### \uD83C\uDFE2 Have you read the Code of Conduct?\r\n\r\n- [X] I have read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\r\n\r\n### Are you willing to submit PR?\r\n\r\nNo, but I'm happy to collaborate on a PR with someone else",

After reviewing the codebase, I have a couple of questions.\r\n\r\n- Since humanizeEntityRef is a function returning a string, how is it suggested to replace EntityDisplayName, which is a React component?\r\n- I have lookup the place using EntityDisplayName, but I can't figure out how it related to the usage of humanizeEntityRef.\r\n\r\nThank you for the patience!", "Hi!\r\n\r\nYeah as I alluded to in the issue description \"There are some cases where you aren't yet in a React tree\"; those cases may need some rewriting where possible (moving work out of a function and instead into a child helper component or similar), or if you find that this isn't working out at all, we'd like to see examples of those cases to see if there's something we should do to extend or alter the API interface to cater to those cases.\r\n\r\nEssentially, the _desired_ end result is that there's no custom rendering of `humanizeEntityRef` or plain `metadat.name` and similar anywhere. Getting all the way there may or may not need alterations to the presentation API.\r\n\r\nEDIT: https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/24595 adds the promise based API", "This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity.

      "description" : "Writing down what occurred to me at the end of the cert-manager biweekly meeting on 28/07\r\n\r\nAn issue with administering trust bundles is that it's very easy + tempting for users to put intermediates in the trust store as a way of \"fixing\" trust issues. Usually this occurs when an app is buggy and only sends the leaf certificate without its chain, and explicitly trusting the leaf's issuing intermediate CA seems to fix the problem for them. Crucially, when that intermediate is then rotated their app will break.\r\n\r\nWe could add a toggle, defaulting to false, such as `allowIntermediateCertificates`. If false, it would parse every certificate and ensure that it's self-signed. There might be other ways of achieving the same goal.\r\n\r\nHaving this in from the start could prevent so many misconfigurations by unsuspecting cluster admins.\r\n\r\n(Complication: If we added a list of publicly trusted certs it'd probably need to default to allowing intermediates in that list by default - but we could definitely default to disallowing intermediates everywhere else)",

This can be difficult to see. See this [codepen](https://codepen.io/ashetland/pen/yLdOgJM?editors=100). \n\nUsing `border.input` would improve contrast and it would be more consistent with other components.\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n\nUse `color.border.input` for `circle` icon.

Instead, I'd suggest removing the body fragment from the error message and emitting it via the logger at the `Debug` level along with increasing its size to 1KB.  \n\nUltimately, this isn't the right place for this information to be logged and it, technically speaking, shouldn't even be in the response and the response must be ignored, per [the spec](https://prometheus.io/docs/specs/prw/remote_write_spec/#protocol):\n\n> The response body from the remote write receiver SHOULD be empty; clients MUST ignore the response body. The response body is RESERVED for future use.\n\nI've reached out to the AMP service team about ensuring this information is available via vended logs.

      "url" : "https://github.com/ONEARMY/community-platform/issues/4245",
      "repositoryName" : "ONEARMY/community-platform",
      "description" : "> Do you have attention to detail and would like to work on making the UI nicer? This issue is then for you! :))\n\n## Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.\n1. Comment section is still not matching the designs. The whitespace is lacking between the nested comments and the visually it looks tight, packed and overwhelming.\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6340e9d-7671-4308-acd0-10bf42bffd4b)\n\n2. Additionally the comment on mobile has spacing from the left, leaving the space not being utilised and making the text unnecessarily squeezed.\n<img width=\"361\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28e206b7-fbe6-471c-a2c4-8f09b1284eeb\" />\n\nEspecially with nested comments it becomes obvious:\n<img width=\"361\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86610c32-e365-414c-868e-02621ca54564\" />\n\n3. If the comment has some enters for new line and the the Show more button shows, it creates an awkward space. There is also gap applied.\n<img width=\"918\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a76486ea-e490-4860-940e-c49498ebeb1e\" />\n\n## Describe the solution you'd like\n\nGenerally I think this will need not only adjusting the numbers, but some minor restructuring of the divs. So, let me try to number the improvements:\n\n---\n\n1. Improving the spacings between the nested comments. In the designs there are also the useful buttons in each comment, that are not yet implemented. In the design however, the spacing occurs naturally because of the useful buttons, so I did not need to add a big margin-bottom. I will leave the solution here up to you, but account for the fact that one day in the future we will introduce the useful button for the comment.\n<img width=\"670\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00f1a492-0cfe-4a26-a6d4-a25e9f1e81d2\" />\n\nDon't be afraid to be generous with the spacings, in the devtools i tried 50px as in my designs\n<img width=\"978\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f23db889-05ba-4607-bedc-25d4a4abc321\" />\n\n---\n\n2. Mobile improvement. Here I upload a gif of the solution that I utilised in the Figma designs - it was to hide the left column with the avatar, allowing the text to stretch and then showing the avatar next to the username in 30x30px size.\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/329f7267-8bdb-4d18-a47c-73b7e44d5478)\n\nDon't forget to make sure that the author's badge is working \n<img width=\"502\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b3012c1-567c-4e5e-b781-5f81852bbe28\" />\n\n\n---\n\n3. Putting the Show More button directly under the comment, trimming the whitespaces. \n<img width=\"947\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c07017f7-60f7-4c1c-92f4-859c1267736f\" />\n\n\n---\n\n4. Decreasing the gap here to 5px from 10px\n<img width=\"404\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a1c56f9-11f3-4bd0-9e52-239948b15c2f\" />\n\n\n\n---\n\n5. As you can see, on mobile it gets quite tight. I would suggest removing the word Published from the \"Published x time ago\" information for the comments.\n<img width=\"322\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe06174a-b402-452b-a18b-eefd38b03192\" />\n\n\n---\n\n6. OPTIONAL - In case you would want to act on the point 5. above even more, I would suggest for mobile screens shortening the formulation even more, saying for example 1h ago, 3mo ago or 2yr ago. Reddit does it this way as well.\n\n<img width=\"182\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c194f4c-a4ee-42a1-9c59-dcd5c6b77e42\" />\n\n---\n\n7. OPTIONAL - In case you would still be up for a challenge, having these 2 aligned on the baseline would be a nice achievement, however I didn't manage to get the desired result, since as you can see below, the align-items:baseline does not align them.\n<img width=\"742\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27968c77-de84-400a-8d3f-22e88b37b627\" />\n\n\n\n##  Additional context - [FIGMA FILE HERE](https://www.figma.com/design/XYV3fr8UVOdkNyBmKHHR7f/CP---Comments-Useful---Mobile?node-id=48-79)\nYou can find the figma file above. You can see the components, the desktop and the mobile versions. These design include the correct answer feature or the useful buttons, which are not yet implemented, so feel free to ignore those.\n\n<img width=\"761\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/119c7345-44cf-4baa-9ef6-feed6a05d7ad\" />\n\nIf you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask. :))",

I'd be happy to include that as well.", "Heyy @JCSergent! Cool to see that you are up for tackling these design improvements. \n\nJust yesterday we were talking with Ben, that this issue was in his opinion hard to follow and that the screenshots I included could be a bit confusing (some of them with the useful button, some without), so I thought about rewriting it. Is the issue clear to you though? If so, than let's keep it and if you find anything even slightly unclear you can tag me in the comments at any time and I'll be happy to give more clarification. :))\n\nAlso Ben mentioned that he does not have the capacity to prioritise this at the moment, so this would actually be really really helpful and valuable contribution from you. <3\n\nBen was also wrote yesterday that some of the points I mentioned were implemented already. After checking, it was only the point 5. - removing the word \"Published\" from the timestamp.\n\nI will ask the team about implementing the useful counter and let you know. :))", "@dalibormrska  - I think I understand it, but here let me try to summarize and let me know if I am understanding your requests correctly.\n\n\nRequest 1: Increase spacing between the nested comments.\nSolutions:\n- Long Term Solution: Add the Useful Counter to comments which will naturally add whitespace between the comments\n- Easier Solution: Manually add whitespace between the nested comments (which is the space the Useful Counter will take up later)\n\nRequest 2: When viewing comments (especially reply comments) in mobile, the comment text is extremely narrow.\nSolution: Remove the left side margin (make the comment text and profile image be on the same vertical line). Use the smaller version of the profile picture. Basically try to get to this design:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4045704-088e-4a7c-a7ff-bf3d1c5535b3)\n\nRequest 3: If a comment has alot of line breaks, there could be an awkward gap between the comment text and the 'Show more' button\nSolution: Remove line breaks from the end of the comment when hiding the rest of the comment behind the 'Show more' button\n\nRequest 4: Decrease Gap between profile/upload date line and comment body from 10px to 5px\nSolution: This is straight forward :), just decrease gap from 10px to 5px\n\nRequest 5: Remove the 'Published ... time ago' part of the upload date to save space\nSolution: Already Done :)\n\nRequest 6 (OPTIONAL): The upload date still takes alot of space on mobile\nSolution: Use time short hand in mobile. For example, use '5h ago' instead of '5 hours ago' or '4mo ago' instead of '4 months ago'\n\nRequest 7 (OPTIONAL): The user flag, user name, and upload date are not aligned\nSolution: Align the 3 on the baseline", "Cool, well summarised, it's pretty much spot-on. :)) \n\nThe only thing that got trickier since then is the Request 4. If you run the project locally or are a beta-tester, you will see that now the three-dots menu next to the top-comment has been implemented. The three-dots button is huge however, which makes the whole header of the top-comment taller than the replies and therefore makes it hard to achieve consistent gap.\n\nI don't know however what makes the most sense from the coding best practices - but I imagine if you tackle the Request 2. and include the avatar image in the comment header, then the whole header will get the height of the image. I would then suggest trying to make the image size and the three-dots menu size the same - let's try 35x35px and adjusting the gap accordingly.\n\n<img width=\"747\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be0d2dc1-70f8-41db-b36a-7eda73e85eb2\" />\n\nOther than that we just wait for @benfurber to assign. :))", "I'm sceptical of making the avatar too small, otherwise what's the point of showing it.\n\nIt's yours @JCSergent.\n\nOne thing to note, I'm about to implement some icon changes which includes the pointing down arrow in these screenshots.", "@benfurber - Yeah I could definitely see that. I'll go ahead and try to implement how the request has it, and we can put it in preview and see how it feels.\n\nOkay cool, I'll keep an eye out for those icon changes.\n\n" ],

This is because we did not migrate the many convenient, abstracted, and commonly used access control test methods from `ui/webapi/BaseActionTest.java` to `sqlui/webapi/BaseActionTest.java`.\n\nAfter merging #13254, all of the access control test methods in `BaseActionTest.java` have been migrated. Hence, this issue aims to refactor the unit test access controls to use these convenient test methods.\n\n## Progress\nThe progress for this refactoring can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IcB-viJMrIOknYoBYasBuRBK9qnwY0-doEK4_Eb24IA/edit?gid=0#gid=0). I (the author) will update it when completed PRs are merged proactively.\n\n## Steps to Contribute\n\n1. Choose test(s) to work on in the above Google Sheets link\n2. Check that no on else have claimed the test cases to work on within the last 2 weeks, or that it has been completed by follow up PRs (but not updated in the sheets)\n3. Comment on this issue to indicate that you'd like to contribute on the chosen test(s). Update your comment if you need more than 2 weeks so that other contributors don't overlap with your work.\n4. Create a PR to refactor the unit test(s).\n5. Submit the PR, with a link to this issue by starting the description with \"Part of #13304\"## Tips\n\n- Understand the access control test methods in `sqlui/webapi/BaseActionTest.java`, follow the refactoring in #13254\n- Most of the access control testing logic in the migrated unit tests under `sqlui/webapi` follows the old unit tests under `ui/webapi`, so you may wish to reference the old unit test for help",

      "comments" : [ "While refactoring the `test_operator_evaluation` function (`/linalg/tests/test_linalg.py`) to remove all `.toarray() `(to better leverage PSYDAC???s native vector/matrix structures and improve efficiency), I noticed that the current computation of the variable `error_est` relies on a full dense inverse via:\n\n```\nBmat = B.toarray()\n\nB_inv_mat = np.linalg.inv(Bmat)\nb_inv_arr = np.matrix.flatten(B_inv_mat)\nerror_est = 2 + n1 * n2 * np.max([np.abs(b_inv_arr[i]) for i in range(len(b_inv_arr))])\n\n```\nSince we???re avoiding those dense NumPy operations for performance and memory reasons, I believe this calculation of `error_est` no longer fits well in the new context. Computing the full inverse matrix is computationally expensive and somewhat contradictory to the iterative sparse methods we???re testing.\n\nCould you suggest an alternative approach for `error_est`?\nFor example, I???m considering replacing it with a simpler, lightweight estimate such as:\n\n`error_est = {some num > 0}* n1 * n2`\n", "This is an error estimate based on the maximum absolute value of the inverse matrix. It could read in fact\n```python\nerror_est = np.linalg.norm(Bmat.flat, np.inf)\n```\nwhich is the inf-norm of the vectorized matrix. This does not seem to give a sharp estimate, given that it is multiplied by a small number just below (`tol = 1e-5`). Maybe @jowezarek could shed some light on this?", "@anushkasinghh @yguclu \nThanks for bringing this up, this code snipped is ridiculously complicated and doesn't do what it's supposed to do :')\n\nThe explicit matrix inverse was never truly needed, and yet there's no time to gain as the entire test ran in < 3 seconds on my machine.\n\nThis particular part of the test was designed to test whether power operations (**0, **1, **2) work with inverse linear operators (ILOs).\n\nThe poorly executed idea of the test was the following:\n```python\n# arbitrary tolerance\ntol = \n\n# Define 2-norm of vector using inner (as proposed by Yaman)\nnorm2 = lambda v: sqrt(v.inner(v))\n\n# Psydac objects, solver with tolerance = tol\nu\nB_ILO = inverse(B, 'cg', tol=tol)\n\n# First test: Check whether B_ILO**0 is the identity matrix (B_ILO**0 = id?)\n\nerror = (B_ILO**0) @ u - u\nassert norm2(error) < 1e-15 # error should really be zero\n\n# Second test: Check whether B_ILO**1 really computes the inverse up to accuracy (B_ILO**1 = B_ILO?)\n# I.e., we expect B @ B_ILO**1 @ u to be equal to u + err, err a vector of norm less than tol\n\nerror = B @ B_ILO**1 @ u - u\nassert norm2(error) < tol\n\n# Third test: Now checking whether B_ILO**2 is really equal to a double application of B_ILO (B_ILO**2 = B_ILO @ B_ILO?)\n# B @ B @ B_ILO @ B_ILO @ u = B @ ( B_ILO @ u + err1 ) = u + err2 + B @ err1\n# where both err1 and err2 are vectors of norm less than tol, hence\n# | B @ B @ B_ILO @ B_ILO @ u - u | = | err2 + B @ err1 | < | err2 | + | B @ err1 | < tol + |B|_{inf} * tol = (1 + |B|_{inf}) * tol\n\nadjusted_tol = ( 1 + np.max(np.abs(B.toarray())) ) * tol\nerror = B @ B @ B_ILO**2 @ u - u\nassert norm2(error) < adjusted_tol", "So if I understand correctly, the old error estimate was:\n```\nerror_est = 2 + n1 * n2 * np.max([np.abs(b_inv_arr[i]) for i in range(len(b_inv_arr))])\nassert norm2((B @ bi22) - bi12) < error_est * tol\n```\n\n@jowezarek 's suggestion improves this by incorporating a more accurate error bound:\n```\nerror_est = (1 + norm(B)) * tol # or error_est = (1 + np.max(np.abs(B.toarray())) ) * tol\nerror = B @ B @ B_ILO**2 @ u - u\nassert norm2(error) < error_est\n\n```\nThis should yield a more reliable tolerance without significant performance cost.\n" ],

Currently, this requires us to configure a new exporter each time a new bucket is introduced, which becomes difficult to manage at scale.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nSince dynamic \"s3_prefix\" support already exists, it would be great to extend this functionality to also support \"s3_bucket\", allowing the bucket name to be derived from resource attributes dynamically.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\nI'm not very familiar with Go, so I'm hoping the owners can take this on. I assume this feature would be relatively straightforward to implement, given that similar logic already exists for s3_prefix.",

Since I always use `gpt-4o`, I checked it just now, and it works for me:\n\n```ts\n// ~/.agent-tars-workspace/agent-tars.config.ts\nimport { resolve } from \"path\";\nimport { defineConfig } from \"@agent-tars/interface\";\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  model: {\n    provider: \"openai\",\n    id: \"gpt-4o\",\n    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,\n  },\n});\n```\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3bacae11-5aa5-440c-b545-0b3247f6af15)\n\n---\n\nI just noticed that you are using a proxy server to access OpenAI. Could you check whether the following config works?\n\n\n```diff\n// ~/.agent-tars-workspace/agent-tars.config.ts\nimport { resolve } from \"path\";\nimport { defineConfig } from \"@agent-tars/interface\";\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  model: {\n    provider: \"openai\",\n    id: \"gpt-4o\",\n    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,\n+  baseURL: http://127.0.0.1:4780\n  },\n});\n```\n\n\n", "It doesn't work. If I write like this,\n```python\nimport { resolve } from \"path\";\nimport { defineConfig } from '@agent-tars/interface';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  model: {\n    provider: 'openai',\n    id: 'gpt-4o',\n    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,\n    baseURL: 'http://127.0.0.1:4780',\n  },\n```\nThe result is:\n\n<img width=\"558\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8a4d5fe-25ca-4a2c-b7c4-d9a45765d527\" />\n\nAlso, if I use the code below for API Verification (without `-x http://127.0.0.1:4780`):\n```bash\ncurl \"https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions\" \\\n    -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n    -H \"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\" \\\n    -d '{\n        \"model\": \"gpt-4o\",\n        \"messages\": [\n            {\n                \"role\": \"user\",\n                \"content\": \"Hello, world.\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }'\n```\nIt also returns a valid response.", "> Tip: The following is created by Agent TARS and verified by me???\n\n---\n\nHi @Wendyfff0616,\n\nThank you for the detailed bug report! I can confirm this is a **proxy configuration issue** with Agent TARS's OpenAI provider.\n\n## Root Cause\n- Your `curl -x http://127.0.0.1:4780` works fine\n- Agent TARS fails because it's not properly using the proxy for OpenAI API calls\n- Direct connections to `api.openai.com` are blocked in mainland China\n\n## Why Current Suggestion Doesn't Work\nThe `baseURL: 'http://127.0.0.1:4780'` suggestion is incorrect - baseURL should point to OpenAI's API endpoint, not your proxy server.\n\n## Temporary Workaround\nTry setting proxy environment variables:\n\n```bash\nexport HTTP_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:4780\nexport HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:4780\nagent-tars --provider openai --model gpt-4o --apiKey your-key\n```\n\n## Looking Forward\nThis is a legitimate issue affecting users in regions requiring proxy access. **We look forward to Agent TARS implementing proper proxy support in future updates.**\n\nThank you for the comprehensive report!\n\n## References\n\nhttps://github.com/openai/openai-node/issues/85\n" ],

      "description" : "### Why do we need this improvement?\n\nCurrently, the website lacks a mechanism for users to easily share blog posts on social media platforms. This limits the reach and visibility of the content, making it harder for readers to promote the blogs organically to a broader audience.\n\n### How will this change help?\n\nThis change will ease the sharing of blog amongst social platforms.\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### How could it be implemented/designed?\n\nAdd social sharing buttons to each blog post. These buttons should allow users to share the post on popular platforms such as:\n\n    Twitter\n    LinkedIn\n\nEach button should generate a pre-filled sharing link, including the blog post title, URL, and possibly hashtags. For example:\n\n```Twitter: https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Check+out+this+blog!&url=https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/2024-annual-summary#social-media```\n\nThe buttons should be visually appealing, lightweight, and non-intrusive. They can be displayed at the top or bottom of each blog post.\n\n### \uD83D\uDEA7 Breaking changes\n\nYes\n\n### \uD83D\uDC40 Have you checked for similar open issues?\n\n- [x] I checked and didn't find a similar issue\n\n### \uD83C\uDFE2 Have you read the Contributing Guidelines?\n\n- [x] I have read the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/asyncapi/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n### Are you willing to work on this issue?\n\nYes I am willing to submit a PR!",

This is similar to #10281 but specific to the appearance.\n\nFor example, when saving settings [we include an ellipsis](https://github.com/google/site-kit-wp/blob/8f1c16bb71bcf5091bc5b56d535e03973d4b9b36/assets/js/components/settings/SettingsActiveModule/Footer.js#L153-L155), but in nearly all other similar buttons we do not.\n\n---------------\n\n_Do not alter or remove anything below. The following sections will be managed by moderators only._\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n\n* When module settings are being saved, after CTA has been clicked and CTA enters in progress state, only spinner icon should be showing, text shouldn't be changing to the `Saving` and ellipsis should not show `...`\n\n## Implementation Brief\n\n* [x] Update `assets/js/components/settings/SettingsActiveModule/FooterPrimaryAction.js`\n  * Remove https://github.com/google/site-kit-wp/blob/4946f1a5df79dfac2ac8f94c6a03283a163241a1/assets/js/components/settings/SettingsActiveModule/FooterPrimaryAction.js#L75 and conditional wrapper around it.\n  * Spinner is already integrated, so no further change is needed\n\n### Test Coverage\n\n* No updates expected\n\n## QA Brief\n\n1. Open any module's settings in `Site Kit > Settings`.\n\n2. Make any changes to the module, when the settings are being saved, the button text should stay as `Confirm changes` and not `Saving...`. Refer attached screenshots.\n\n#### Before\n\n<img width=\"538\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bb85e75-191a-445f-aa63-a17394d88c44\" />\n\n#### Latest change\n\n<img width=\"685\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55bcc527-4db0-4535-bdd5-a93952abfa30\" />\n\n## Changelog entry\n\n* Update the \"Confirm changes\" module settings button to retain its label while saving.\n\n",

Would be very handy for those cases :smile: \n\n### Alternatives\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional information\n\nThis is a duplicate of https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/issues/918, which unfortunately was closed by the author",

I'm trying to understand more about this codebase.\n> \n> Heroic does not have any feature to claim Epic games\n\nSince I seem to be able to even buy games through the Heroic Launcher, I'm confused about this answer...\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0772793-49f0-4a09-b984-185404ff5b4c)", "> ### Problem description\n> Hey \uD83D\uDC4B\n> \n> Epic is famous for giving free games every now and then, and I have a Discord bot that alerts me whenever there's a new one available, including a link to the game in question, which on windows opens the epic client on the page of the game.\n> \n> E.g.: Currently the free game is https://store.epicgames.com/p/melvor-idle-b6a9b3, and its link to open on the epic client is com.epicgames.launcher://store/p/melvor-idle-b6a9b3, so the `melvor-idle-b6a9b3` is the important part here, which indicates the game to go to.\n> \n> On linux with the heroic games launcher, it just opens firefox `com.epicgames.launcher://store/p/melvor-idle-b6a9b3`, but obviously firefox doesn't know what to do with it.\n> \n> ### Feature description\n> Would it be possible to have the same behaviour from the epic games client on the heroic client, opening the game on the store page? Would be very handy for those cases \uD83D\uDE04\n> \n> ### Alternatives\n> _No response_\n> \n> ### Additional information\n> This is a duplicate of [#918](https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/issues/918), which unfortunately was closed by the author\n\nHi is this issue still existing and open? I would love to look into this as I have worked on something like this before", "hey @devpool007 \uD83D\uDC4B \n\nThis still happens, feel free to take a look into it :) ", "> hey [@devpool007](https://github.com/devpool007) \uD83D\uDC4B\n> \n> This still happens, feel free to take a look into it :)\n\nThanks for the reply! Ok I try to look into it :) \nAlso from what I understood, you encounter this issue on linux right? Could you let me know what OS you are using btw?", "I'm on CachyOS (arch-linux on wayland) with Hyprland as the DE. I believe the issue is platform-agnostic though, but I might be wrong.", "> I'm on CachyOS (arch-linux on wayland) with Hyprland as the DE. I believe the issue is platform-agnostic though, but I might be wrong.\n\nAlright thanks! Yeah I know it could be platform-agnostic but it's always nice to know the background. I am mostly on macOS and will try to replicate it there and update here later. " ],

I've already attempted to address some of the process (environment container management) in #193 .

I'm using the factorio.com version and it worked without any issues. **I think using factorio.com should be the standard approach** since steam has its own state and update cycle and it's unclear how that will interact with the docker images built in the repo.\n\nFor postgres I also had to run a command similar to the one in the README for sqlite. Unclear if others had to do something similar. This is what I ran in my Postgres factorio db:\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE programs (\nid SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\ncode TEXT NOT NULL,\nvalue REAL DEFAULT 0.0,\nvisits INTEGER DEFAULT 0,\nparent_id INTEGER,\nstate_json TEXT,\nconversation_json TEXT NOT NULL,\ncompletion_token_usage INTEGER,\nprompt_token_usage INTEGER,\ntoken_usage INTEGER,\nresponse TEXT,\nholdout_value REAL,\nraw_reward REAL,\nversion INTEGER DEFAULT 1,\nversion_description TEXT DEFAULT '',\nmodel TEXT DEFAULT 'gpt-4o',\nmeta TEXT,\nachievements_json TEXT,\ninstance INTEGER DEFAULT -1,\ndepth REAL DEFAULT 0.0,\nadvantage REAL DEFAULT 0.0,\nticks INTEGER DEFAULT 0,\ncreated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n);\n```\n\nThis is all I have in my notes for installation hiccups.

      "description" : "## Feature Description\n\nA Go package that provides a set of utility functions to perform conversions between commonly used units such as bytes, time, and temperature.\n\n---\n\n## Use Case\n\nMany applications require frequent conversions between data sizes (bytes to MB), time units (seconds to hours), and temperature units (Celsius to Fahrenheit). Instead of reimplementing this logic repeatedly, a centralized utility package allows for clean, reusable, and testable conversion functions across different services and applications.\n\n---\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nCreate a new `convert` package. The package will expose clearly named functions to convert:\n\n- Data Sizes: Bytes ??? KB ??? MB ??? GB\n- Time: Seconds ??? Minutes ??? Hours ??? Days\n- Temperature: Celsius ??? Fahrenheit ??? Kelvin\n\nThe package will use constants for unit multipliers where applicable, and follow idiomatic Go function naming.\n\n---\n\n## Additional Context\n\nThis utility package is meant to be lightweight and dependency-free. The logic should avoid third-party libraries and be kept easily testable and benchmarkable. The package can be expanded in the future to support additional categories (e.g., distance, volume, speed).\n\n---\n\n## Pseudo Code\n\n```go\n// Data size conversion functions\nfunc BytesToKB(b int64) float64\nfunc KBToBytes(kb float64) int64\nfunc BytesToMB(b int64) float64\nfunc MBToBytes(mb float64) int64\nfunc BytesToGB(b int64) float64\nfunc GBToBytes(gb float64) int64\n\n// Time conversion functions\nfunc SecondsToMinutes(s int64) int64\nfunc MinutesToSeconds(m int64) int64\nfunc MinutesToHours(m int64) int64\nfunc HoursToMinutes(h int64) int64\nfunc HoursToDays(h int64) int64\nfunc DaysToHours(d int64) int64\n\n// Temperature conversion functions\nfunc CelsiusToFahrenheit(c float64) float64\nfunc FahrenheitToCelsius(f float64) float64\nfunc CelsiusToKelvin(c float64) float64\nfunc KelvinToCelsius(k float64) float64\nfunc FahrenheitToKelvin(f float64) float64\nfunc KelvinToFahrenheit(k float64) float64\n",

Offending code is usually references from Google APIs. One such violation that isn't currently covered is `URI`, but there may be others we should add that have slipped by.\n\n---------------\n\n_Do not alter or remove anything below. The following sections will be managed by moderators only._\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n\n* The list of acronyms that Site Kit enforces casing for is updated to include the following additional acronyms::\n  * `SDK` \n  * `EMM` \n  * `REST` \n  * `GKE` \n  * `URI`  \n  * `UX`  \n  * `OS` \n  * `GCP` \n  * `DNS`  \n  * `FCM`  \n  * `IAM` \n  * `IP` \n  * `ISO`\n\n## Implementation Brief\n\n* [x] In `packages/eslint-plugin/rules/acronym-case.js`\n  * Expand the list of Acronyms to include the items listed in AC https://github.com/google/site-kit-wp/blob/3eacb691d9d832ac0f473f17e54c1bb581205a89/packages/eslint-plugin/rules/acronym-case.js#L108\n\n\n### Test Coverage\n\n* Include few new acronyms to the list of existing tests in `packages/eslint-plugin/rules/acronym-case.test.js`\n\n## QA:Eng Brief\n\n* Run unit tests for `acronym-case.js`.\n* Confirm new acronyms (`SDK`, `EMM`, `REST`, `GKE`, `URI`, `UX`, `OS`, `GCP`, `DNS`, `FCM`, `IAM`, `IP`, `ISO`) are correctly flagged when casing is incorrect (e.g., `Sdk`).\n* Verify new acronyms pass when casing is correct (e.g., `sdk`, `SDK_CONSTANT`).\n* Ensure existing acronyms (e.g., `HTML`, `JSON`, `ID`) still behave as expected.\n* Check that ignored cases (imports, function calls, global objects) continue to be ignored.\n\n\n## Changelog entry\n\n* <!-- One sentence summarizing the PR, to be used in the changelog. -->\n",

It also provided ability for companies to run scripts on the EC2 machines securely using it's RunCommand feature. Adding SSM RunCommand Operator to the Amazon provider package will unlock migration to Airflow from legacy job scheduling frameworks like AutoSys\n\n### Use case/motivation\n\nI work with a few customers that are in the process of migrating jobs from AutoSys and other legacy frameworks to Airflow. For these customers, a lot of their existing jobs are in shell scripts running on EC2. When they migrate to Airflow, they are looking for an easy way to lift those scripts and run on Airflow. SSHOperator could be an option for this but in many corporate environments, SSH is disabled for security reasons. One of the secure ways AWS recommends executing a remote script on EC2 is by using SSM RunCommand.\n\n### Related issues\n\n_No response_\n\n### Are you willing to submit a PR?\n\n- [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n",

From the first to the second.\n\nCase 2: Directory not reachable\n\n- Assume that `personal.bib` has `personalfiles` configured as file directory.\n- Assume that `parent.bib` has configured `parentfiles` as file directory.\n\nThen, the relative path is `something.txt` for `personal.bib` - and also for `parent.bib`. Thus no need to adapt anything.\n\nCase 3: Directory not reachable and relative paths differ\n\n- Assume that `personal.bib` has `.` configured as file directory.\n- Assume that `parent.bib` has configured `parentfiles` as file directory.\n\nThen, the relative path is `something.txt` for `personal.bib`. It should be `personalfiles/something.txt` for `parant.bib` AND `./parerntfiles/personalfiles`  be created as directory - to keep the nested directory structure. \n\n> But if I copy an entry from personal.bib to paper.bib, and paper.bib has @ Comment{jabref-meta: fileDirectory:paperfiles;}, the file is still reachable without copying.\n\nThen, your assumption is that `parent.bib` has `bibs/paperfiles` configured and `personal.bib`, `paperfiles`. Then the relative paths starting from that are the same for both.\n\nIn case BOTH have `paperfiles` configured, the first path is `./paperfiles`, the second one is `bibs/paperfiels`. But they are DIFFERENT (see the `bib` included in the second). And this is case 1.\n\n> However, the current implementation keeps the file field as:\n> \n> file = {:personalfiles/something.txt:TXT}\n> \n> And you would like that to be changed to a relative path like:\n> \n> file = {:../personalfiles/something.txt:TXT}\n\nIn case the directory is \"reachable\" (based on the directory configuration). If the file is non-reachable, it needs to be copied. Case 3.\n\nYou need to document this. Create a file `files.md` in https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/tree/main/docs/requirements. Follow the guidance at `index.md` there how to do.\n\n", "Thank you for the detailed explanation! I???ll try to implement and document it over the weekend." ],

      "repositoryName" : "medplum/medplum",
      "description" : "## Description\n\nWhen using Medplum's AWS Textract integration to extract text from PDF documents, the API response contains a `NextToken` field. This token indicates that the response is paginated and that additional results are available. However, it appears that the current Medplum integration does not utilize the `NextToken` to fetch the next set of results, which causes incomplete text extraction when the document is large.\n\nI noticed that the [loadAwsConfig](https://github.com/medplum/medplum/blob/main/packages/server/src/cloud/aws/config.ts#L13) function references the `NextToken`, so I would like to confirm whether this behavior is due to a misconfiguration on my end. I tested the integration using the AWS Textract action available in the Medplum app (app.medplum.com) as well as with the [textract demo bot](https://github.com/medplum/medplum/blob/main/examples/medplum-demo-bots/src/textract-bot.ts), and encountered the same issue in both cases.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Go to https://app.medplum.com/Media/new\n2. Upload a PDF with many pages\n3. Go to its detail page\n4. Click on the `AWS Textract` action to process the PDF\n5. Once the extraction is complete, open the detail page of the resulting `Media` resource\n6. Check that the `content` only contains text from the first page of the PDF, and also check for the presence of the `NextToken` attribute indicating more pages of text are available\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc6876a1-0b3b-468f-9d7b-e5c8dfa650a5)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/189b43ae-5feb-4775-b62e-9c5d47adbab6)\n",

      "description" : "### Feature description\r\n\r\nMany of our existing algorithm files have little to no unit testing. This is problematic because this can easily let bugs slip through. We want some assurance that the code we currently have is correct and functional. We welcome all contributors to open PRs to help us add tests to our codebase.\r\n\r\n### How to find low-coverage files\r\n\r\nGo to the Actions tab in this repository and find the most recent **build** workflow run. Open the logs under \"Run Tests\" and scroll down until you find the section on code coverage:\r\n```\r\n---------- coverage: platform linux, python 3.12.0-final-0 -----------\r\nName                                                                          Stmts   Miss  Cover   Missing\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nquantum/q_fourier_transform.py                                                   30     30     0%   14-93\r\nscripts/validate_solutions.py                                                    54     54     0%   2-94\r\nstrings/min_cost_string_conversion.py                                            78     75     4%   20-57, 61-75, 79-129\r\n...\r\n```\r\nThe \"Cover\" column tells you what percentage of the lines in that file are covered by tests. We want to increase this percentage for existing files. Find a file with low coverage percentage that you wish to write tests for, add doctests for each function, and open a PR with your changes. You do not need to have a perfect coverage percentage, but all functions should have doctests.\r\n\r\nSome files will naturally be hard to write tests for. For example, the file may be poorly written because they lack any functions. Other files might be how-tos, meaning they simply demonstrate how to use an existing library's functions rather than implementing the algorithm themselves. Ignore these kinds of files, as they will need to be rewritten eventually. Furthermore, ignore files in the `web_programming` and `project_euler` directories. Web programming files are inherently hard to test and Project Euler files have their own validation workflow, so don't worry about their test coverage.\r\n\r\n_**When you open your PR, put \"Contributes to #9943\" in the PR description.**_ Do not use the word \"fixes\", \"resolves\", or \"closes\". This issue is an ongoing one, and your PR will not single-handedly resolve this issue.\r\n\r\n### How to add doctests\r\n\r\nA doctest is a unit test that is contained within the documentation comment (docstring) for a function. Here is an example of what doctests look like within a docstring:\r\n```py\r\ndef add(a: int, b: int) -> int:\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Adds two non-negative numbers.\r\n    >>> add(1, 1)\r\n    2\r\n    >>> add(2, 5)\r\n    7\r\n    >>> add(1, 0)\r\n    1\r\n    >>> add(-1, -1)\r\n    Traceback (most recent last):\r\n    ...\r\n    ValueError: Numbers must be non-negative\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n```\r\nFor every function in the file you choose, you should write doctests like the ones shown above in its docstring. If a function doesn't have a docstring, add one. Your doctests should be comprehensive but not excessive: you should write just enough tests to cover all basic cases as well as all edge cases (e.g., negative numbers, empty lists, etc).\r\n\r\nDo not simply run a function on some example inputs and put its output as the expected output for a doctest. This assumes that the function is implemented correctly when it might not be. Verify independently that your doctests and their expected outputs are correct. **Your PR will not be merged if it has failing tests.** If you happen to discover a bug while writing doctests, please fix it.\r\n\r\n_**Please read our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before you contribute.**_",

Open the logs under \"Run Tests\" and scroll down until you find the section on code coverage:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> ---------- coverage: platform linux, python 3.12.0-final-0 -----------\r\n> Name                                                                          Stmts   Miss  Cover   Missing\r\n> -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n> quantum/q_fourier_transform.py                                                   30     30     0%   14-93\r\n> scripts/validate_solutions.py                                                    54     54     0%   2-94\r\n> strings/min_cost_string_conversion.py                                            78     75     4%   20-57, 61-75, 79-129\r\n> ...\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> The \"Cover\" column tells you what percentage of the lines in that file are covered by tests. We want to increase this percentage for existing files. Find a file with low coverage percentage that you wish to write tests for, add doctests for each function, and open a PR with your changes. You do not need to have a perfect coverage percentage, but all functions should have doctests.\r\n> \r\n> Some files will naturally be hard to write tests for. For example, the file may be poorly written because they lack any functions. Other files might be how-tos, meaning they simply demonstrate how to use an existing library's functions rather than implementing the algorithm themselves. Ignore these kinds of files, as they will need to be rewritten eventually. Furthermore, ignore files in the `web_programming` and `project_euler` directories. Web programming files are inherently hard to test and Project Euler files have their own validation workflow, so don't worry about their test coverage.\r\n> \r\n> _**When you open your PR, put \"Contributes to #9943\" in the PR description.**_ Do not use the word \"fixes\", \"resolves\", or \"closes\". This issue is an ongoing one, and your PR will not single-handedly resolve this issue.\r\n> \r\n> ### How to add doctests\r\n> A doctest is a unit test that is contained within the documentation comment (docstring) for a function. Here is an example of what doctests look like within a docstring:\r\n> \r\n> ```python\r\n> def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:\r\n>     \"\"\"\r\n>     Adds two non-negative numbers.\r\n>     >>> add(1, 1)\r\n>     2\r\n>     >>> add(2, 5)\r\n>     7\r\n>     >>> add(1, 0)\r\n>     1\r\n>     >>> add(-1, -1)\r\n>     Traceback (most recent last):\r\n>     ...\r\n>     ValueError: Numbers must be non-negative\r\n>     \"\"\"\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> For every function in the file you choose, you should write doctests like the ones shown above in its docstring. If a function doesn't have a docstring, add one. Your doctests should be comprehensive but not excessive: you should write just enough tests to cover all basic cases as well as all edge cases (e.g., negative numbers, empty lists, etc).\r\n> \r\n> Do not simply run a function on some example inputs and put its output as the expected output for a doctest. This assumes that the function is implemented correctly when it might not be. Verify independently that your doctests and their expected outputs are correct. **Your PR will not be merged if it has failing tests.** If you happen to discover a bug while writing doctests, please fix it.\r\n> \r\n> _**Please read our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before you contribute.**_\r\n\r\nI just wanted to say that I can resolve this...", "I have contributed to this issue by adding doctests for minimum_coin_change.py and improving the function's efficiency.\n\nAdded doctests to ensure proper validation of the function.\nOptimized code by removing unnecessary int() conversions.\nUpdated function parameter type from value: str ??? value: int to avoid redundant type casting.\nEnsured correctness by covering basic and edge cases in the doctests.\nand get rid of the grammer mistakes\n\nPlease review and merge when possible.

      "description" : "# Problem\n\nThe emergence of the **inference-time compute paradigm** presents a critical safety challenge: ensuring **chain-of-thought (CoT) faithfulness**. Through our work on **OptiLLM**, an open-source inference optimization framework implementing over 15 state-of-the-art techniques (MCTS, Chain-of-Thought, Mixture of Agents, etc.), we've identified three interconnected risks in reasoning models:\n\n1. **Unfaithful reasoning chains**: Reasoning becomes unfaithful to the model's actual decision process, creating a false impression of safety while masking problematic reasoning.\n2. **Monitoring degradation**: As reasoning complexity increases, transparency decreases, weakening monitoring mechanisms.\n3. **Unsafe exploration**: During reasoning, models may \"think\" about harmful content even when final outputs appear safe.\n\nThese challenges are particularly dangerous because they undermine our ability to verify safety properties and apply safeguards in frontier models. Recent research confirms that even leading reasoning models can exhibit significant unfaithfulness in complex reasoning tasks [1,2].\n\n# Approach\n\nWe propose **SafeCoT**, a comprehensive framework to **measure, monitor, and ensure chain-of-thought faithfulness**. Our approach leverages our expertise in inference-time optimization to:\n\n- Create a **taxonomy of faithfulness failures** across diverse reasoning models and tasks\n- Develop **quantitative faithfulness metrics** tailored to various inference-time techniques\n- Implement **real-time monitoring systems** to detect faithfulness violations during inference\n- Design **intervention mechanisms** to address safety risks when faithfulness violations are detected\n- Build a **benchmarking suite** to evaluate the correlation between CoT faithfulness and downstream safety outcomes\n\nWe will leverage **OptiLLM's inference proxy architecture** to integrate monitoring capabilities with any reasoning model via their APIs, ensuring broad applicability across the AI ecosystem.\n\n# Impact\n\nThis project will deliver:\n\n- An **open-source toolkit** for evaluating CoT faithfulness across reasoning models\n- **Empirical evidence** on how faithfulness correlates with safety across inference techniques\n- **Practical monitoring strategies** for inference-time compute, ready for integration into existing systems\n- **Adaptive intervention mechanisms** to mitigate unsafe reasoning behaviors\n\nBy systematically addressing CoT faithfulness, we aim to provide the AI safety community with both a **deeper scientific understanding** of this critical challenge and **practical tools** to enhance safety in the inference-time compute paradigm.\n\n# References\n\n1.

These stories need improving.\n\nHow can you find these ones that need more states?\n\nIf you run make frontend-test from the root of the repo you'll see it prints out some code coverage.\n`cd frontend && npm run test -- --coverage`\n\nFrom that you could see if there's any more major code paths that might need covering with more story states.\n(There's a html report in coverage/index.html as well with more details)\n\n\n## Where should the stories go?\n\nA good example to look at is `src/components/common/ActionButton`.\n\nThe preferred layout is the folder layout like this:\n\n```\nComponent/Component.tsx, main place where the component goes. Named after the component.\nComponent/index.tsx, This should export things from Component.tsx\nComponent/Component.stories.tsx, contains the component shown in different states.\nComponent/__snapshots__ , where the story shot files are.\n```\n\n## Presentational VS container (logic) components\n\nSee [documentation here](link-to-story-js). In short, the logic should be separated so mainly the component can be tested without dependencies on other things. An example of logic that could be separated is API calls.\n\nSome refactoring is probably needed to implement stories:\n\n- to place components in a folder, with filenames the same name as the component\n- to separate the presentational \"pure\" parts\n\n## viewing the stories, and running the tests\n\nTo view the storybook:\n\n```bash\ncd frontend\nnpm install\nnpm run storybook\n```\n\nTo run the tests, and generate the snapshot files (rendered html):\n\n```bash\ncd frontend\nnpm install # not needed if you've done it already.\nnpm run test -- --coverage\n```\n\nYou can also run the tests without the interactive test runner like this:\n```bash\nCI=true npm run test -- --coverage\n```\n",

There is one widespread pattern that triggers the cop which feels \"wrong\":\n\n```ruby\ndef do_something\n  return false unless should_be_done?\n\n  internal_do_something\n\n  true\nend\n```\n\nI.e., the main thing about the method is side effects, but it also returns booleans indicating whether it has invoked something or not. It shouldn't be named like a predicate, but the cop will suggest so.\n\n## Describe the solution you'd like\n\nHow can we filter out those methods? It is not very simple but pretty straightforward:\n* starting from each return value\n* go back through statements in the method body\n* ...and check if this statement assigns some value used to calculate the return value; if not, it is not a predicate.\n\nE.g., this is not a predicate:\n```ruby\ndef foo\n  File.write('test.log', some_data) # this doesn't participate in result\n\n  true\nend\n```\n...and this is a predicate:\n```ruby\ndef foo\n  data = File.read('test.log', some_data) # this is used to calculate the next line\n  line = data.find { it.include?('ERROR:') } # this is used to calculate value used for result\n\n  line.match?('not found') # start analysis from here\nend\n```\n\nIt will still miss edge cases like this (side effect is present, but doesn't look like it\n```ruby\ndef foo\n  some_complicated_side_effect(lot, of, params) == :success\nend\n```\n...but so will the human, so `rubocop:disable` in this case + appropriate comment would be helpful :)",

", "Is this prevalent and diverse enough that using `AllowedMethods`/`AllowedPatterns` won't work for your use case? In my experience a lot of these sort of methods are named `call`, for instance, which is added to `AllowedMethods` by default. If you follow a similar pattern, there could be a simpler solution.\n\nOtherwise, my concern is that this would overly complicate the cop. It would essentially mean that any method that returns a literal boolean where it isn't the only statement would be considered to not be a predicate, because there is work being done that isn't considered in the return value.\n\n> ```ruby\n> def foo\n>  some_complicated_side_effect(lot, of, params) == :success\n> end\n> ```\n\nI don't see why this shouldn't be a predicate method, since it's returning a pretty straightforward check (does the complicated method return `:success`, the side effects in the method are not relevant IMO).\n\n> Since the method has side effects, it should end with a `!` and probably this cop should ignore bang methods\n\nSupport for allowing bang methods (`AllowBangMethods: true`) was added in #14270.", "> Is this prevalent and diverse enough that using `AllowedMethods`/`AllowedPatterns` won't work for your use case?\n\nWell, IDK for now, I'll experiment with it. But the intuition says that it doesn't depend on the method's name, but on its implementation. So the list of allowed names/patterns might grew indefinitely if it is the only way to tell Rubocop \"no, that should not be a predicate.\"\n\n> I don't see why this shouldn't be a predicate method, since it's returning a pretty straightforward check (does the complicated method return :success, the side effects in the method are not relevant IMO).\n\nThis really depends on the side effects. (But in general, if the method _has_ significant side effects, it isn't a predicate in my book.)\n\nFor a bit less abstract example, a pattern I saw in several codebases was returning booleans from action methods to know if the next action should be done. Like, the main code might do something like this:\n\n```ruby\nsave_user and update_stripe_account and send_emails\n```\nI.e., `save_user` might return `false` if the user was invalid (and it also updated the user's `valid?`/`errors`, so the controller that invoked this code might redraw the form and highlight the errors). Then `update_stripe_account` might return `false` if Stripe API returned some error (and again, it might've been saved in some other object to show in UI), and so on.\n\nWhether those methods should be named `save_user?`/`update_stripe_account?` is up to the developer's/team's opinion. For me, they definitely should not. For me, a predicate is an idempotent method that just answers a question about the object's properties, not does something, and returns if it was done successfully.\n\nAnd returning to `AllowedMethods`/`AllowedPatterns` question, it even might be so that in one context, `save_user` does what I have described, and in other context (or maybe even in this very class!), `save_user?` is a predicate that answers \"should we save the user\"?", "I've disabled this cop for false positives and no discernible benefit in any of my projects. I'm posting this to remind people that's an option.", "> I've disabled this cop for false positives and no discernible benefit in any of my projects. I'm posting this to remind people that's an option.\n\nThis is true. \n\nFor our project, though, the cop is not useless (to say the least). \n\nWe have maybe a \"usual\" case of an old codebase that'd lived for many years and is updated \"as best as we can\", with many small irritating things remaining unnoticed. \n\nA new, well-defined cop is usually tremendously helpful for some \"face-lifting.\" This one is exactly the case: in our codebase, it was triggered on many small methods in rarely used corners, that \"everybody probably agrees should be a predicate, but it was already this way when we came\" (and in our policies, \"Rubocop is triggered\" is a good case for small refactorings). \n\nIt was also triggered by methods with genuinely weird signatures (which returned booleans, and thus Rubocop wanted them to be predicates, but actually nobody needed the booleans they returned, so it is the signature that should be fixed). But also, on methods I describe in original tickets, where only inline `disable`s help :)\n\nThat's why I spend some time discussing it: for us, it is tremendously helpful, just in this helpfulness something is amiss :)", "Could an option be added to only run one aspect of the cop? It currently does two things:\n\n1. Methods that return a boolean should end in a question mark.\n2. Methods that don't return a boolean shouldn't end in a question mark.\n\nFrom both this discussion and internal discussion after running this cop on some of our projects, it seems (2) is far less controversial than (1). It would be nice to allow the cop to only check (2) and ignore (1)." ],

      "description" : "### What's the problem this feature will solve?\n\nOur efforts in adopting MLIR within the MQT have been steadily progressing.\n#880 is the first PR that adds interoperability with an external framework, namely Xanadu's Catalyst and their `Quantum` dialect.\nTo connect the ecosystem further and to extend the compatibility of the MQT, this issue aims to add support for NVIDIA's `quake` dialect that is used within CUDA-Q. See https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-quantum/blob/main/Overview.md for a brief overview.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nSimilarly to the solution currently being pursued in #880, it should be possible to translate MLIR programs using the Quake dialect to our internal `mqtopt` or `mqtdyn` (see comment below for more details) dialect and back.\nThe conversion itself can probably borrow quite a few of the implementation details from #880.\nThe intriguing aspect is the packaging aspect in the sense that it is still an open question how to best add these translations without adding an unconditional dependency on cuda-q. Ideally, the integration is set up similar to how we currently handle Qiskit as an optional plugin of the mqt-core Python package: https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/core/tree/main/src/mqt/core/plugins/qiskit",

      "comments" : [ "We currently have two MLIR dialects: `mqtopt` and `mqtdyn`. \n`mqtopt` uses value semantics, i.e. each operation \"consumes\" a quantum state and returns an updated state.\n`mqtdyn` uses memory semantics. Here, each operation is performed on a reference to a qubit, similar to e.g. OpenQASM's `x q[0]`.\n\nAs Quake supports memory semantics (`!quake.ref`) *and* value semantics (`!quake.wire`), this makes conversions a bit more complex. We would rather not have a mix between `mqtopt` and `mqtdyn`, so the Quake operations should be converted to only one of the two dialects. I can see both of them making sense:\n\n- *Convert to `mqtdyn`*: `!quake.ref` operations can be converted directly to `mqtdyn` qubits. For `!quake.wire` operations, search the reference it was originally pulled from through the `quake.unwrap` operation and use that information to translate the wire into a `mqtdyn` qubit.\n- *Convert to `mqtopt`*: `!quake.wire` operations can be converted directly to `mqtopt` qubits and their corresponding `quake.wrap`/`quake.unwrap` calls roughly align with `mqtopt.extractQubit` and `mqtopt.insertQubit` calls. For `!quake.ref` operations, `mqtopt` qubits can be extracted from a register using `mqtopt.extractQubit`. Here, we have to keep track in detail what qubit comes from what `mqtopt`-register-index and from what `quake.ref` to make sure different operations do not interfere with each other.\n\nBoth approaches seem reasonable, but the first one (converting to `mqtdyn`) seems a bit simpler and may therefore be the better solution, intuitively." ],

Pick a package, look through the code and add type hints. Just for primitives for now, more complex types need a bit of thought. Many have npt.ArrayLike types, but we have not decided on standardising on that, so leave these alone. Dont feel you have to do them all, this is a good first issue to get you started. \n\n### Describe your proposed solution\n\nfor example, the constructor for the anomaly detection algorithm STRAY has these type hints\r\n\r\n```\r\n    def __init__(\r\n        self,\r\n        alpha: float = 0.01,\r\n        k: int = 10,\r\n        knn_algorithm: str = \"brute\",\r\n        p: float = 0.5,\r\n        size_threshold: int = 50,\r\n        outlier_tail: str = \"max\",\r\n    ):\r\n ```\r\nbut the segmentation algorithm CLASP does not\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef _is_trivial_match(candidate, change_points, n_timepoints, exclusion_radius=0.05):\r\n    \"\"\"Check if a candidate change point is in close proximity to other change points.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered, if relevant\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

Adding SHA-512 support would enable Trivy to fully process these SBOMs and preserve important security metadata.\n\n### Current limitations:\n- **CycloneDX**: SHA-512 hashes are ignored and the hashes field becomes `null`\n- **SPDX**: SHA-512 checksums are completely omitted from the output\n\n\n## Current Behavior\n\n### CycloneDX\nIn `pkg/sbom/cyclonedx/unmarshal.go:251-268`, the `unmarshalHashes` function only supports:\n- SHA1\n- SHA256\n- MD5\n\nAny other algorithm (including SHA-512) logs a warning but still creates a digest with an empty algorithm prefix (e.g., `:hashvalue` instead of `sha512:hashvalue`), resulting in malformed digest strings.\n\n### SPDX\nIn `pkg/sbom/spdx/marshal.go:501-522`, the `spdxChecksums` function has the same limitation, returning `nil` for unsupported algorithms.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe limitation stems from `pkg/digest/digest.go` which only defines three algorithms:\n```go\nconst (\n    SHA1   Algorithm = \"sha1\"\n    SHA256 Algorithm = \"sha256\"\n    MD5    Algorithm = \"md5\"\n)\n```\n\n## Desired Behavior\n\nTrivy should support SHA-512 hash algorithm alongside the existing SHA-1, SHA-256, and MD5 support. This would enable Trivy to:\n- Preserve SHA-512 hashes when processing SBOMs from NPM and other tools\n- Generate SBOMs with SHA-512 hashes when appropriate\n- Maintain full compatibility with CycloneDX and SPDX specifications\n\n\n## Impact\n\n- Loss of package integrity verification data\n- Generated SBOMs may be invalid or incomplete\n- Affects tools that rely on SHA-512 for security validation\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n1. Add SHA512 constant to `pkg/digest/digest.go`:\n   ```go\n   const (\n       SHA1   Algorithm = \"sha1\"\n       SHA256 Algorithm = \"sha256\"\n       SHA512 Algorithm = \"sha512\"\n       MD5    Algorithm = \"md5\"\n   )\n   ```\n\n2. Add SHA-512 calculation support in the digest package\n\n3. Update `unmarshalHashes` in CycloneDX:\n   ```go\n   case cdx.HashAlgoSHA512:\n       alg = digest.SHA512\n   ```\n\n4. Update `spdxChecksums` in SPDX:\n   ```go\n   case digest.SHA512:\n       alg = spdx.SHA512\n   ```\n\n## References\n\n- NPM SBOM documentation: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npm-sbom\n- CycloneDX hash algorithm specification: https://cyclonedx.org/docs/1.6/json/#components_items_hashes\n- SPDX checksum specification: https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/package-information/#79-package-checksum-field\n\n## Test Data\n\n### CycloneDX Example\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"http://cyclonedx.org/schema/bom-1.5.schema.json\",\n  \"bomFormat\": \"CycloneDX\",\n  \"specVersion\": \"1.5\",\n  \"components\": [\n    {\n      \"bom-ref\": \"lodash@4.17.21\",\n      \"type\": \"library\",\n      \"name\": \"lodash\",\n      \"version\": \"4.17.21\",\n      \"hashes\": [\n        {\n          \"alg\": \"SHA-512\",\n          \"content\": \"bf690311ee7b95e713ba568322e3533f2dd1cb880b189e99d4edef13592b81764daec43e2c54c61d5c558dc5cfb35ecb85b65519e74026ff17675b6f8f916f4a\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### SPDX Example\n```json\n{\n  \"spdxVersion\": \"SPDX-2.3\",\n  \"packages\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"lodash\",\n      \"SPDXID\": \"SPDXRef-Package-lodash-4.17.21\",\n      \"checksums\": [\n        {\n          \"algorithm\": \"SHA512\",\n          \"checksumValue\": \"bf690311ee7b95e713ba568322e3533f2dd1cb880b189e99d4edef13592b81764daec43e2c54c61d5c558dc5cfb35ecb85b65519e74026ff17675b6f8f916f4a\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Discussed in https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy/discussions/9082\n",

This option is _only_ available on the dashboard. So to start an instant meeting while in a conversation, one first has to drop to the dashboard to then create the meeting.

This launch task can be set to have upstream dependencies, however no matter what the launch task will not wait on any dependencies to execute, executing as soon as the dag run starts.\nThis keeps us from using any parameters defined as part of a task that is intended to run before the task group initializes, for example setting parameters in the task group definition.\n\n\n### What you think should happen instead\n\nThis task should instead wait on prior tasks to finish as aligned with the trigger_rule assigned to that specific task. As the trigger_rule by default for the launch task is set to all_success, the task should NOT run until all upstream dependencies have finished.\n\n<img width=\"674\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83abb3ce-1d36-4e12-b485-b0855a0caf2b\" />\n<img width=\"982\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/836fcfe2-21c4-4784-b470-ac2d2dca2e54\" />\n\n### How to reproduce\n\n```from airflow.models import DAG\nfrom airflow.operators.dummy import DummyOperator\nfrom airflow.providers.databricks.operators.databricks_workflow import (\n    DatabricksWorkflowTaskGroup,\n)\nwith DAG(\n    dag_id=\"example_dag\",\n    schedule_interval=f\"0 0 * * *\",\n) as dag:\n    start_task = DummyOperator(task_id=\"end\", trigger_rule=\"none_failed\")\n\n    task_group = DatabricksWorkflowTaskGroup(\n        group_id=\"tg\",\n        databricks_conn_id=\"FILL IN DBX CONNECTION ID\",\n        job_clusters={\n            \"job_cluster_key\": \"test_cluster\",\n            \"new_cluster\": {\n                \"cluster_name\": \"\",\n                \"spark_version\": \"15.4.x-scala2.12\",\n                \"node_type_id\": \"r4.2xlarge\",\n                \"num_workers\": 1,\n                \"autoscale\": {\"min_workers\": 2, \"max_workers\": 8},\n                \"aws_attributes\": {\n                    \"availability\": \"SPOT_WITH_FALLBACK\",\n                    \"ebs_volume_count\": 1,\n                    \"ebs_volume_size\": 100,\n                    \"ebs_volume_type\": \"GENERAL_PURPOSE_SSD\",\n                    \"first_on_demand\": 1,\n                    \"spot_bid_price_percent\": 100,\n                    \"zone_id\": \"auto\",\n                },\n            },\n        },\n    )\n\n    with task_group:\n        pass\n```\n### Anything else\n\n_No response_\n\n### Are you willing to submit PR?\n\n- [x] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n",

      "description" : "### Summary\n\nAt the login screen, sometimes we need to enter a verification code received by email, likely when we sign up on a new device. This email verification input field appears after providing the correct username and password. \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Freshly install the Commons App\n2. Open the app and try to log in with your username and password\n3. An email verification input field should appear\n4. Make sure email verification input field is focused\n5. Tap on the `Enter` button in the software keyboard of Android\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nThe **IME Action** for the email verification input field should be either `Done` or `Go`. Also, the input field's height shouldn't increase when pressing the `Enter` button.\n\n### Actual behaviour\n\nThe `Enter` **IME Action** is displayed in the Android's soft keyboard, and tapping that increases the input field's height.\n\n### Device name\n\nPixel 6\n\n### Android version\n\nAndroid 14\n\n### Commons app version\n\nMain Branch\n\n### Device logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### Screen-shots\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7177768-7721-405e-a838-90b12a1a6a9c\n\n### Would you like to work on the issue?\n\nPrefer not",

I've tried to analyze the macOS compatibility issues in the Nebraska development scripts and I would like to point out thefollowing potential problems:\n\n1. **Bash version incompatibility**:\n  - `backend/tools/check_pkg_test.sh` uses `mapfile` (line 11), which was introduced in bash 4.0\n  - [macOS ships with bash 3.2 because they have licensing problems](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255353799?answerId=259964001022&sortBy=rank#259964001022)\n\n2. **GNU vs BSD utilities**:\n  - `backend/tools/setup_local_db.sh` and `backend/tools/run-all.sh` use GNU getopt with `--longoptions`\n  - macOS ships with BSD getopt which doesn't support long options like `--longoptions`\n  - This is a fundamental difference between BSD and GNU implementations\n\n3. **There might be other similar compatibility issues, e.g. in**:\n  - backend/tools/run-all.sh - uses GNU getopt with long options and bash arrays\n\n### Potential fix for check_pkg_test.sh\n\nReplace lines 10-11:\n```bash\noutput_lines=()\nmapfile -t output_lines < <(go list -f '{{.Dir}} - {{.TestGoFiles}} {{.XTestGoFiles}}' ./...)\n```\n\nWith this bash 3.2 compatible version:\n```bash\noutput_lines=()\nwhile IFS= read -r line; do\n    output_lines+=(\"$line\")\ndone < <(go list -f '{{.Dir}} - {{.TestGoFiles}} {{.XTestGoFiles}}' ./...)\n```\n\n### Workaround for GNU Utilities\n\nInstall GNU versions via Homebrew:\nbrew install coreutils gnu-getopt\n\n### Add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bash_profile:\nexport PATH=\"/usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin:$PATH\"\nexport PATH=\"/usr/local/opt/gnu-getopt/bin:$PATH\"\n\n### Testing Help Needed\n\nI don't have access to macOS to test these changes. Could someone please:\n\n1. Test if the modified check_pkg_test.sh works with the change above\n2. Verify if the GNU utilities installation resolves issues with other scripts\n3. Try running make and make run-backend after installing dependencies (the gnu utility, docker etc.)\n4. Report any other script failures and their error messages\n\nOnce confirmed working, we should create a PR with:\n- The script compatibility fix\n- Updates to the main README\n\nAny macOS developers willing to help test? \uD83D\uDE4F\n" ],

      "comments" : [ "Although it isn't specified in the RFC (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-3.4) many libraries allow passing the same query parameter multiple times, e.g. `somequery?key=3&key=4`. If Seastar doesn't mess this up (e.g., by using a map instead of a list), this can be a way to specify two key components without needing to invent yet another serialization format.\r\n", "According to https://support.datastax.com/s/article/HOW-TO-Specify-composite-partition-keys-for-SSTable-utilities, the colon is expected to work - although this isn't officially specified in the nodetool getendpoints documentation so I'm note sure we should follow this bad advice:\r\n\r\nThe reason why this is a bad syntax is that it makes keys like \"a:b\" ambiguous - is it one component with the \":\" character, or two components? It's not an issue of implementation, it's a bug in nodetool syntax that makes this case ambiguous and nodetool has no idea what the user intended.\r\n\r\n> Since the key is passed over an http-based interface I suggest to allow encoding `:` characters using the standard http encoding as `%3A` substrings (`seastar::http::internal::url_decode` can be used to decode such strings).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if that was your intention, but such encoding (which obviously has to happen when building the REST API URL), will not help to differentiate whether \"a:b\" is two components or one with a colon. Also, if the nodetool API is already ambgious (what does the \"a:b\" the user passed mean?) there is no way that additional encoding can fix it.\r\n\r\nIf you change anything in this area, please don't forget to add tests.", "From the api standpoint what I had in mind is to pass `key=a%3Ab` if the non-composite key (or one of its components) contains `:`.\r\nThe user can pass that to nodetool as well.\r\n\r\nThat said, allowing passing multiple components as request parameters is possible too, though with the current interface it is not intuitive to assume that the multiple key parameters indicate multiple components of a composite key rather than multiple keys, if the API supported returning the natural endpoints for multiple keys.\r\n\r\nNote that `%3A` is supported for `keyspace:table` \"tuples\" when passed as a single parameter or as a comma-separated list of `keyspace:table`, to support keyspace or table names containing `:`.", "> From the api standpoint what I had in mind is to pass `key=a%3Ab` if the non-composite key (or one of its components) contains `:`. The user can pass that to nodetool as well.\r\n\r\n`key=a%3Ab` is the url-encoded form of setting key to `a:b`. But now that Scylla receives it, how does it know if this was intended to be a string key `a:b` or two components?\r\n\r\nMaybe you were thinking of encoding **twice**? If that's the case, the first layer of encoding doesn't need to be URL encoding. Just the outer layer of encoding must be.\r\n\r\nAre you sure about what you said about `keyspace:table` allowing real \":\"? Last time I checked, I found that at least in one context, you are only allowed to have colons in the table name, not keyspace name (e.g., in Alternator GSI), and what happens is simply that Scylla splits only on the first colon, so `xyz:abc:qwe` means that `xyz` is the keyspace, `abc:qwe` is the table. That's a different thing that what you are hoping to do here.", "Can't we use key:\"value:has:colons\"? ", "> Can't we use key:\"value:has:colons\"?\r\n\r\nOf course, that's one way to represent it (with taking care of escaping `\"` characters within the string if needed).\r\nBut we need to be consistent, and the proposal to use %3A to encode column characters is consistent with an http-based REST API.\r\n\r\nIntroducing a new option for composite keys, e.g. `ckey`, that can be given multiple times to build the key is also an elegant option that is consistent with REST API.\r\n\r\nLike @nyh said, we still need to fix the nodetool layer to support composite keys containing `:`.\r\nThere, one could use string quoting or even hex encoding to represent binary key values.", "> Of course, that's one way to represent it (with taking care of escaping `\"` characters within the string if needed). But we need to be consistent, and the proposal to use %3A to encode column characters is consistent with an http-based REST API.\r\n\r\nBut it won't be \"consistent\" - you'll need to run the URL encoding **twice**, which is possible, but not something traditionally done in HTTP. So we gain nothing by making the \"inner\" encoding also another invocation of the URL encoding, it can be something else like quotes or backslashing colons or something. Whatever this inner encoding is, it will need to be documented.\r\n \r\n> Introducing a new option for composite keys, e.g. `ckey`, that can be given multiple times to build the key is also an elegant option that is consistent with REST API.\r\n\r\nYes, this is similar to what I suggested above, although theoretically you don't even need to change the existing option \"key\" if you just allow it to be given multiple times - unless giving a key multiple times has another meaning in the API (maybe an OR of several different keys)? @amnonh would know.\r\n", "> > Of course, that's one way to represent it (with taking care of escaping `\"` characters within the string if needed).

Test in test/rest_api that checks the REST API request in two cases: single-partition-key-column-and-colon-in-the-key and two-partition-key-column-and-colon-used-as-separator. Perhaps we already have a test for the latter case?\n2. Test in dtest or test/nodetool (I'm not up to date on what's right) that checks the nodetool command, not rest api. What we change in the REST API **should** translate also to the nodetool command but it's not obvious that it does and should be tested. Some ideas raised in this issue required even more explicit changes to nodetool that would need to be tested.\n\nPlease also see my recommendation in https://github.com/scylladb/scylladb/pull/24720 to improve the commit message to say exactly what we're fixing and what we aren't, and also consider which documentation we need to update to explain the situation with the colon.\n\n> \n> [@denesb](https://github.com/denesb) should review\n\n", "We should fix for non-singular keys too, otherwise we are just kicking the can down the road.", "> We should fix for non-singular keys too, otherwise we are just kicking the can down the road.\n\nIt's unlikely we can fully resolve this for non-singular (composite) keys, especially when text columns are involved. Regardless of the delimiter used, there's always a risk of collision - either with actual characters in the key or encoded sequences such as `%3A`.\n\nAs for the alternative of specifying the ckey option multiple times (e.g., --ckey=\"part1\" --ckey=\"part2\"), that approach is also problematic. While nodetool might be able to parse such input reliably, we still need to pass it to our API. This would require merging the parts into a single string, which again reintroduces the possibility of ambiguous delimiters or collisions." ],

These credentials can now be retrieved using the central github [action](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-github-actions/blob/main/.github/workflows/aws-secrets-management.yml)\n\n### Useful Contacts\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_\n\n### Definition of Done\n\n- [ ] Update workflows\n- [ ] Test\n- [ ] Remove GH secrets\n",

We need to add more to cover all the code in vllm-ascend, and there are several principles to follow:\n\n1. The overall file tree should be consistent with `vllm_ascend`\n2. The file name should be the original file name with a prefix `test_`\n3. Use `unittest` framework, make good use of mock\n4. The UTs are all running on cpu node, mock the function related to device to host\n\nPlease refer to the official doc on [contributing](https://vllm-ascend.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide/contribution/index.html) and [testing](https://vllm-ascend.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide/contribution/testing.html) to develop, thanks!\n### Unit tests need to add\n\n- [ ] |-- test__version.py\n- [x] |-- test_ascend_config.py\n- [ ] |-- test_attention\n- [ ] |   |-- test_attention.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_attention_v1.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_mla_v1.py\n- [ ] |-- compilation\n- [ ] |   `-- test_piecewise_backend.py\n- [ ] |-- core\n- [ ] |   |-- test_schedule_config.py @nuclearwu\n- [ ] |   `-- test_scheduler.py\n- [ ] |-- device_allocator\n- [ ] |   `-- test_camem.py\n- [ ] |-- distributed\n- [ ] |   |-- test_communicator.py @FieeFlip\n- [ ] |   |-- test_device_communicators @Agonixiaoxiao #1601\n- [ ] |   |   |-- test_pyhccl.py\n- [ ] |   |   `-- test_pyhccl_wrapper.py\n- [x] |   |-- kv_transfer @Agonixiaoxiao \n- [x] |   |   |-- test_simple_buffer.py https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1531\n- [x] |   |   |-- test_simple_connector.py https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1531\n- [x] |   |   |-- test_simple_pipe.py https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1531\n- [ ] |   |   `-- test_utils.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_llmdatadist_connector.py\n- [x] |   `-- test_parallel_state.py   @wangyanhui-cmss https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1460\n- [ ] |-- test_envs.py\n- [ ] |-- lora\n- [ ] |   `-- punica_wrapper @hongfugui\n- [ ] |       `-- test_punica_npu.py @hongfugui\n- [ ] |-- models\n- [ ] |   |-- test_deepseek_dbo.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_deepseek_mtp.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_deepseek_v2.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_qwen2_5_vl.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_qwen2_5_vl_without_padding.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_qwen2_vl.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_qwen3_moe.py\n- [ ] |-- multistream\n- [ ] |   |-- test_base.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_context.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_decorator.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_layers.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_metadata.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_ms_split.py\n- [ ] |-- ops\n- [ ] |   |-- test_activation.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_attention.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_cache.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_common_fused_moe.py\n- [x] |   |-- test_expert_load_balancer.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_fused_moe.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_layernorm.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_rotary_embedding.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_vocab_parallel_embedding.py\n- [ ] |-- patch\n- [ ] |   |-- platform\n- [ ] |   |   |-- patch_0_9_1\n- [ ] |   |   |-- patch_common\n- [ ] |   |   |   `-- test_test_patch_distributed.py\n- [ ] |   |   `-- patch_main\n- [ ] |   `-- worker\n- [ ] |       |-- patch_0_9_1\n- [ ] |       |-- patch_common\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_distributed.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_eagle.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_minicpm.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_multi_step_worker.py\n- [x] |       |   |-- test_patch_sampler.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_spec_decode_worker.py\n- [ ] |       |   `-- test_patch_utils.py\n- [ ] |       `-- patch_main\n- [x] |-- test_platform.py @zhanghw0354 https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1476\n- [ ] |-- quantization\n- [ ] |   |-- test_func_wrapper.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_quant_config.py @nuclearwu\n- [ ] |   |-- test_quantizer.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_w8a8.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_w8a8_dynamic.py\n- [ ] |-- sample\n- [ ] |   |-- ops\n- [ ] |   `-- test_rejection_sampler.py\n- [x] |-- test_utils.py\n- [ ] `-- worker \n- [ ] |-- test_cache_engine.py @machenglong2025\n- [ ] |-- test_draft_model_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_model_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_model_runner_v1.py\n- [ ]  |-- test_mtp_proposer_v1.py @machenglong2025\n- [ ] |-- test_multi_step_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_multi_step_worker.py\n- [ ] |-- test_pooling_model_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_worker.py @zhanghw0354\n- [ ] `-- test_worker_v1.py @zhanghw0354\n",

However, in some cases, this information alone isn't sufficient to identify heavy queries. It would be beneficial to also display the estimated memory usage per query (`memory_estimated_bytes` field).\n\nFor example, the queries `sum(a) + sum(b)` and `sum(a + b)` operate on the same number of samples but consume vastly different amounts of memory???the first is lightweight, while the second is significantly heavier.\n\nBy showing memory usage in the UI, such differences would be immediately visible, making it easier to detect and troubleshoot inefficient queries.\n\nWhile we are on it, can we expose at this plage samples processed by query too ?",

Possibly these libraries also come with a dynamic dropdown upon typing '@' that will suggest user names in the given person's project. \r\n- How exactly would you suggest handling invalid usernames? Ideally I'd validate before submitting and then show a form error to the user, such that they don't submit invalid username tags.

Which was beneficial when all I wanted was to perform a quick restore (or inspect if restore is even possible).\r\nI mainly used the restore button sub-menu's \"Restore to...\" functionality (which acted as described in the main window \"https://backintime.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mainwindow.html#files-toolbar\").\r\n\r\nWhy was it deemed necessary:\r\nThe main use case was to correct for user mistakes. Be it deletion (using ``rm``, so no trash for me) or accidental overwritten the wrong file.\r\nWhen that happens I usually already was at the filesystem location of interest or could quickly arrive there since most programs allow for \"open file explorer at location from last save\".\r\nFrom there on it was a simple CLI call to backintime or a custom action from the file-explorer. Which was easier to do than opening the backintime main window and navigating to the path of interest.\r\n\r\nThe file-explorer custom action is another benefit of the \"call binary and supply path routine\". This is something a user can \"easily\" implement for it's file-explorer of choice without the need for backintime to supply plugins for multiple known file-explorers.\r\n\r\nHope this explanation is of help.", "Thanks for explaining. You mean you used `$ backintime foobar` (not `backintime-qt`) and then a GUI window came up?", "No problem, after all I did raise the issue :wink:\r\n\r\nFrom a history dive it turned out I was using the following commands (as stored in thunar's `uca.xml`)\r\n```xml\r\n<action>\r\n\t<icon>$someArbitraryIcon</icon>\r\n\t<name>Previous Versions</name>\r\n\t<unique-id>$someUniqueNumber</unique-id>\r\n\t<command>/usr/bin/backintime-qt4 -s %f</command>\r\n\t<description>Restore previous (file) versions using backintime.</description>\r\n\t<patterns>*</patterns>\r\n\t<directories/>\r\n\t<audio-files/>\r\n\t<image-files/>\r\n\t<other-files/>\r\n\t<text-files/>\r\n\t<video-files/>\r\n</action>\r\n<action>\r\n\t<icon>$someArbitraryIcon</icon>\r\n\t<name>Previous Versions (root)</name>\r\n\t<unique-id>$someUniqueNumber</unique-id>\r\n\t<command>pkexec '/usr/bin/backintime-qt4' -s %f</command>\r\n\t<description>Restore previous (file) versions using backintime (as root).</description>\r\n\t<patterns>*</patterns>\r\n\t<directories/>\r\n\t<audio-files/>\r\n\t<image-files/>\r\n\t<other-files/>\r\n\t<text-files/>\r\n\t<video-files/>\r\n</action>\r\n```\r\nWhere `%f` inserts the path to the first selected file/directory.\r\nFor the `pkexec` command I created a custom polkit rule (in case you were wondering why it was there)\r\n", "Thanks for the reply.\r\n\r\nIt is a nice to have feature.

How can BIT decide which profile to open ?\n\nThis is something I hadn't considered before since it never occurred in my use case. In case you are wondering about 'user' feedback, and based on the \"Why was it deemed necessary:\" section from my first post on the 9th of June 2024. I would give the following ordered list of preference.\n\n1. Don't care which profile, show timestamps from all profiles and only start worrying about a specific profile once a user selected a specific date/timestamp which to inspect further (or restore).\n    * Even if this means 'duplicate' timestamps, although i believe this to be a very rare occurrence given the shown fidelity (image shows seconds).\n3. If the caller (script) did not provide a specific profile use the oldest one (first profile?). Or the main one, in case there exist a concept of profiles with different levels of importance.\n    * This point outsources the responsibility for selecting the correct profile to the system maintainer. Under the assumption that if a maintainer is 'qualified' enough to specify multiple overlapping profiles it becomes their responsibility to maintain 3rd party scripts/callers (the essence of this functionality).\n3. Provide a GUI (or adapt the snapshot one) for selecting the profile to query.\n\nPlease note: This is just a *wish* list, without any regards to the difficulties in coding. No expectations arise from this list (at least from my perspective).", "Thank you very much for your feedback. That helps a lot. With the man page you linked to I had a specific string I could search the git history for.\n\n```\n$ git log -S \"show snapshots dialog for the specified path\"\n\ncommit b2bb84d5b00e2e84a11736cf3ff7d91b57b77f98\nAuthor: Germar <germar.reitze@gmail.com>\nDate:   Sun Jun 9 21:56:34 2013 +0200\n\n    update help and man pages\n\ncommit f19fe9e2121d3123e26b46305b5f8f16a6e5729f\nAuthor: Germar <germar.reitze@gmail.com>\nDate:   Thu Nov 1 23:06:35 2012 +0100\n\n    store plaintext manpages in bazaar\n\n```\nSo related commits might be\n- b2bb84d5b00e2e84a11736cf3ff7d91b57b77f98\n- f19fe9e2121d3123e26b46305b5f8f16a6e5729f\n\nI will take a closer look later.", "OK, I had time to think about it. The \"Snapshots dialog\" will be removed someday and all its features and behavior will somehow be integrated in the main window and its timeline widget.\n\nWith this in mind I would formulate the requested feature like this:\n\n- Open a backup profile in GUI by just specifying a path to a directory or folder contained in the backup source (one of the include-list entries).\n- If multiple profiles containing this path, a) offer a GUI to select one of the profiles and/or b) select the first/oldest profile.

This is particularly helpful when it comes to port existing FastAPI applications to MCP.

When using the Replicate provider, model names must follow the format 'username/model-name' and contain exactly one '/' character. If this format is not followed, the system will raise a `CredentialsValidateFailedError` <sup>[[1]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/13289)</sup>.\n\nAdditionally, there is a similar solved discussion about adding a local Ollama model error. The solution involved upgrading Ollama to the latest version and using the new endpoint `api/embed`, as the old ones have been deprecated <sup>[[2]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/discussions/7362)</sup>.\n\nIt seems like the issue you're facing might be related to the format of the model name or the endpoint being used.

      "description" : "### \uD83E\uDDED Epic\n\n**Title:** Test Server Connectivity from Gateway UI  \n**Goal:** Help administrators debug server setup issues by interactively sending custom HTTP requests to configured MCP servers  \n**Why now:** When adding a new MCP server, it's often unclear if a given URL or endpoint is live, secure, or responding as expected. Today, users must use curl/Postman to debug. This feature allows testing any method, path, headers, or body directly from the Gateway UI.\n\n---\n\n### \uD83E\uDDED Type of Feature\n\n- [x] New functionality\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDE4B????????? User Story 1\n\n**As a:** Gateway administrator  \n**I want:** to send custom HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.) to any path on the server I'm configuring  \n**So that:** I can debug connectivity, validate endpoint behavior, and inspect the actual server responses before saving\n\n#### ??? Acceptance Criteria\n\n```gherkin\nScenario: Send a custom request to the server before saving\n  Given I am adding a new server in the Gateway UI\n  And I enter a server base URL\n  When I click \"Test Server\"\n  Then I should be able to:\n    - Choose an HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)\n    - Enter a relative path (e.g., /health)\n    - Provide optional headers and request body\n  When I click \"Send\"\n  Then the system sends the request to base_url + path\n  And I should see:\n    - HTTP status code\n    - Total response time (latency)\n    - Response body (pretty-printed JSON if possible)\n```\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDCD0 Design Sketch (optional)\n\n```\n+-------------------- Gateway UI ---------------------+\n| Server URL: https://api.example.com                |\n|                                                    |\n| [ Test Server ] ??? opens test panel                 |\n+----------------------------------------------------+\n\n??? click\n\n+-------------------- Test Server --------------------+\n| Method: [GET ???]                                     |\n| Path: /version                                      |\n| Headers (JSON): { \"Authorization\": \"Bearer xyz\" }  |\n| Body (JSON): { \"foo\": \"bar\" } (for POST, PUT...)   |\n| [ Send ]                                            |\n|                                                    |\n| ???

      "comments" : [ "<!-- Answer -->\nThis is a known UI limitation: Dify's app list uses infinite scroll (not numbered pagination), loading 30 apps per page as you scroll. If you only see 30 apps, the infinite scroll likely isn't triggering because of a fragile layout???usually due to container height, flex, or overflow settings. The IntersectionObserver that loads more apps only fires if its anchor element is scrolled into view, which won't happen if the scrollable container doesn't fill the viewport or if the anchor isn't pushed down by enough content.

The problem is in the `crud_controller.go` file where readonly fields are using the HTML `readonly` attribute instead of the `disabled` attribute.\n\n#### **Current Implementation Issues:**\n\n**All field types are affected:**\n- **String fields** (lines 1257-1259, 1240-1242): Uses `readonly` attribute\n- **Int fields** (lines 1293-1295): Uses `readonly` attribute  \n- **Bool fields** (lines 1322-1324): Uses `readonly` attribute\n- **Float fields** (lines 1360-1362): Uses `readonly` attribute\n- **Date fields** (lines 1391-1393): Uses `readonly` attribute\n- **UUID fields** (lines 1458-1460): Uses `readonly` attribute\n- **Timestamp fields** (lines 1481-1483): Uses `readonly` attribute\n- **Decimal fields** (lines 1528-1530): Uses `readonly` attribute\n- **Select fields** (lines 1617-1619, 1638-1640, 1660-1662): Uses `readonly` attribute\n\n#### **Root Cause:**\nThe difference between HTML attributes:\n- `readonly`: Field is non-editable but still focusable and interactive\n- `disabled`: Field is completely non-interactive and truly disabled\n\nSince the crud controller already excludes readonly fields from form processing, the intention is that these fields should be completely disabled from user interaction.\n\n### **Implementation Plan**\n\n#### **Step 1: Update Field Rendering Logic**\n**File:** `/home/runner/_work/iota-sdk/iota-sdk/modules/core/presentation/controllers/crud_controller.go`\n\nReplace all occurrences of:\n```go\nif field.Readonly() {\n    builder = builder.Attrs(templ.Attributes{\"readonly\": true})\n}\n```\n\nWith:\n```go\nif field.Readonly() {\n    builder = builder.Attrs(templ.Attributes{\"disabled\": true})\n}\n```\n\n**Lines to update:**\n- Line 1241: Textarea readonly handling\n- Line 1258: Text input readonly handling  \n- Line 1294: Number input readonly handling\n- Line 1323: Checkbox readonly handling\n- Line 1361: Float input readonly handling\n- Line 1392: Date input readonly handling\n- Line 1459: UUID input readonly handling\n- Line 1482: Timestamp input readonly handling\n- Line 1529: Decimal input readonly handling\n- Line 1618: Static select readonly handling\n- Line 1639: Searchable select readonly handling\n- Line 1661: Combobox select readonly handling\n\n#### **Step 2: Test Field Behavior**\n- Create test cases to verify readonly fields are properly disabled\n- Test form submission to ensure disabled fields don't interfere\n- Verify visual appearance meets expectations\n\n#### **Step 3: Consider CSS Styling**\n- Ensure disabled fields have appropriate visual styling\n- Check that form components handle `disabled` attribute correctly\n\n#### **Step 4: Update Documentation**\n- Update any relevant documentation about readonly field behavior\n- Consider adding comments about the disabled vs readonly choice\n\n---\n\n**Expected Outcome:**\nFields marked with `readonly: true` will render as `disabled` inputs, making them completely non-interactive while still visible for reference.\n\n### **Summary**\n\nThe issue affects **12 specific lines** across all field types in the crud controller. The fix is straightforward: replace `readonly` with `disabled` in the HTML attributes. This change aligns with the expected behavior where readonly fields should be completely non-interactive rather than just non-editable.\n\nThe implementation is ready to proceed with the identified changes.\n\n---" ],

Forked and cloned the repository, then searched the codebase for `readline` usage to find the core input handling logic.\n2.  Identified `useKeypress.ts` (for raw keypress events) and `InputPrompt.tsx` (for input logic) as the key files.\n3.  To see what the application receives, I temporarily modified the code to log every keypress event to a `debug.log` file.\n4.  **Key Finding:** My initial debugging proved that on a default macOS Terminal, `Shift+Enter` sends the exact same sequence (`\\r`) as a regular `Enter` press, making the two indistinguishable.\n\n### Attempted Fix & The Final Discovery\n\nBased on the initial finding, I attempted a code-only fix by teaching the application to listen for a different key combination, `Shift+Down`, which often sends a unique sequence on other terminals.\n\n1. The Code I Tested\nI modified `useKeypress.ts` to listen for the `Shift+Down` sequence (`\\x1b[1;2B`) and `InputPrompt.tsx` to handle a `key.shift` flag.\n\n```typescript\n// In useKeypress.ts, I added a check:\nif (key.sequence === '\\x1b[1;2B') {\n  key.name = 'return';\n  key.shift = true;\n}\n```\n```typescript\n// In InputPrompt.tsx, I added the key.shift check:\nif (key.ctrl || key.meta || key.shift || charBefore === '\\\\' || key.paste) {\n  // ... newline logic\n}\n```\n\n2. The Result: It Also Failed\nThis proof-of-concept did not work. To understand why, I used the `cat` command to see what my terminal was actually sending when I pressed `Shift+Down`.\nFinal Proof: The terminal sent `^[[B`, which is the standard escape code for a plain Cursor Down key.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis investigation leads to a definitive conclusion: the default macOS Terminal is more limited than anticipated. It appears to strip the `Shift` modifier information from both the `Enter` key and the arrow keys, making a code-only fix for a `Shift+Key` newline combination unfeasible on this specific platform, although i think this might work on other platforms which by default register shift + down as '\\x1b[1;2B' but i cant really test it.\n\nThis might explain why `Ctrl+J` is a common suggested alternative, as it sends a universal newline character (`\\n`) that doesn't rely on modifier key parsing.\n\nAs this is my first contribution, my analysis could be wrong, and I apologize for the detailed-but-failed attempt. Given these findings, what is the desired path forward? Any information from the internal `b.corp.google.com` link about how other terminals are supported would still be very helpful.\n\nThank you for your time and guidance.", "Just to add, I personally use the Warp Terminal on Mac.

Specifically, inside `DagFileProcessor._execute_dag_callbacks`, the following code fails:\n`dag = dagbag.dags[request.dag_id]  # returns empty\n`\n\nThis happens because `dagbag.process_file()` cannot find the DAG file at the specified path (versions/<commit_hash>/...), and so the DAG is never loaded, and the callback is silently skipped.\n\n### What you think should happen instead\n\nThe DAG Processor should also materialize the correct version of the DAG source code (i.e., clone the Git repository to the appropriate `versions/<commit_hash>` path) before attempting to load and execute DAG-level callbacks.\n\n\n\n### How to reproduce\n\n1. Use GitDagBundle with supports_versioning=True.\n2. Define a DAG-level `on_failure_callback` or `on_success_callback`.\n3. Deploy a new Git version and trigger a DAG run that invokes the callback.\n4. The DAG tasks execute successfully.\n5. But DAG callback fails because the path in the callback request is under versions/<commit_hash>/, which is not materialized\n6. As a workaround, we patched GitDagBundle.refresh() to also clone the repo into the `versions/` directory.\n\n### Anything else\n\nIn our environment, DAGs are triggered via Asset, but this should not affect the behavior.\n\n### Are you willing to submit PR?\n\n- [x] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n",

      "description" : "For translation purposes, we need to replace all human-readable text in the UI components with `i18n(key)` calls. This will allow for easier localization in the future.\r\n\r\n## Tasks\r\n- [ ] Identify all human-readable text in files located under `./src/gui/src/UI`\r\n- [ ] Replace each instance of human-readable text with `i18n(key)`\r\n- [ ] Add corresponding translations for each key in `./src/gui/src/i18n/translations/en.js`\r\n\r\n## Implementation Details\r\n1. Go through each file in `./src/gui/src/UI`\r\n2. For each human-readable string found:\r\n   - Create a unique, descriptive key for the string\r\n   - Replace the string with `i18n(key)`\r\n   - Add the key-value pair to `./src/gui/src/i18n/translations/en.js`\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```javascript\r\n<button>Submit</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```javascript\r\n<button>{i18n('submit')}</button>\r\n```\r\nIn `./src/gui/src/i18n/translations/en.js`:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst en = {\r\n    name: \"English\",\r\n    english_name: \"English\",\r\n    code: \"en\",\r\n    dictionary: {\r\n        // ... existing translations\r\n        'submit_button_text': 'Submit',\r\n        // ... existing translations\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Additional Notes\r\n\r\n- Ensure keys are descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention\r\n- Be cautious with dynamic text or text that includes variables\r\n- Consider context when creating keys to avoid potential conflicts\r\n\r\n## Definition of Done\r\n\r\n- All human-readable text in files under `./src/gui/src/UI` is replaced with `i18n(key)` calls.\r\n- All new keys are added to `./src/gui/src/i18n/translations/en.js` with correct English translations.\r\n- The application builds without errors and all UI elements display correctly.",

      "description" : "## Description\n\nHi,\n\ncurrently AWS EBS CSI IRSA policy prevents EBS CSI to edit tags if [VAC with tag specifications are applied](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-ebs-csi-driver/tree/master/examples/kubernetes/modify-volume#volume-modification-via-volumeattributesclass) to a pvc. This is the preventing policy:\n\n```\n  statement {\n    actions = [\"ec2:CreateTags\"]\n\n    resources = [\n      \"arn:${local.partition}:ec2:*:*:volume/*\",\n      \"arn:${local.partition}:ec2:*:*:snapshot/*\",\n    ]\n\n    condition {\n      test     = \"StringEquals\"\n      variable = \"ec2:CreateAction\"\n      values = [\n        \"CreateVolume\",\n        \"CreateSnapshot\",\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nSo the condition only permits creating tags on CreateAction while DeleteTags does not implement any condition.\n\nIf your request is for a new feature, please use the `Feature request` template.\n\n- [X] ??? I have searched the open/closed issues and my issue is not listed.\n\n## Versions\n\n- Module version [Required]:\n5.54.0\n- Terraform version:\n1.11.4\n- Provider version(s):\nv5.83.0\n\n## Reproduction Code [Required]\n\nkubectl apply -f manifests/pod-with-volume.yaml\nkubectl apply -f manifests/volumeattributesclass.yaml\n\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n\n1. Create a VAC for which a tag is specified which will be created on the EBS volume\n2. Set the volume attribute class on a PVC\n3. EBS CSI volume fails with error:\n\n`\"Error from AWS API\" err=\"api error UnauthorizedOperation: You are not authorized to perform this operation. User: ebs-csi-role is not authorized to perform: ec2:CreateTags on resource: <volume_arn> because no identity-based policy allows the ec2:CreateTags action.`\n\n`failed to create tags\" err=\"operation error EC2: CreateTags, https response error StatusCode: 403\n`\n## Expected behavior\n\nWhen the condition:\n\n```\n    condition {\n      test     = \"StringEquals\"\n      variable = \"ec2:CreateAction\"\n      values = [\n        \"CreateVolume\",\n        \"CreateSnapshot\",\n      ]\n    }\n```\n\nIs removed from the policy, EBS CSI controller is able to create a tag specified in VAC on an EBS volume.\n\n## Actual behavior\n\nEBS CSI fails to create tag due to AWS policy which permits creating tags only on a ec2:CreateAction\n",

      "description" : "### Current Behavior\r\nCurrently for new users we do not have enough starter templates that they can use as introductory material.\r\n\r\n### Desired Behavior\r\nWe want to create a Design Critique template to allow new users to understand how they can create a Design Critique diagram with Kanvas. So we'd want contributors to not just create a design template but also add tips or notes they think a new user would need if they are starting out with little to no context of the capabilities Kanvas offers.\r\n\r\n### Implementation\r\nMake sure you use [Kanvas](https://kanvas.new/extension/meshmap) to create this template and keep the template private.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Provide a brief overview of what this template does and can help with, maybe highlight a usecase\r\n- [ ] Add a template that can be directly copied and used instantaneously\r\n- [ ] Add a step by step process to create this template\r\n- [ ]  Once the design is completed, publish it and share the private link with our team, or tag us in the comment component to receive feedback.\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Tests\r\n- Template has been submitted for publishing to the catalog and accepted; is published and available in the Meshery Catalog.\r\n- We are in need of well annotated and described templates like [this](https://playground.meshery.io/extension/meshmap?mode=design&design=ad9ec213-4e28-4cda-ba60-042b270ca0c3) one.\r\n### Mockups\r\nThis [FigJam](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1085289819681923775) template can be used for recreating the Design Critique Template\r\n\r\n### Perks\r\nBy contributing to this task, your efforts will have a lasting impact! Once published, your design will be cloned and used by countless users as a go-to starting point for creatingDesign Critique in Kanvas. You'll not only help newcomers understand the platform but also see your work adopted widely by the community. Plus, as a token of appreciation, you'll receive a special shoutout, recognising your valuable contribution. Your effort won???t go unnoticed???you're directly helping shape the experience for future users!\r\n\r\n---\r\n### Contributor [Guides](https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing) and [Handbook](https://layer5.io/community/handbook)\r\n- \uD83D\uDEE0 [Meshery Build & Release Strategy](https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/build-and-release)\r\n- \uD83D\uDCDA [Instructions for contributing to documentation](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#documentation-contribution-flow)\r\n   - Meshery documentation [site](https://docs.meshery.io/) and [source](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/tree/master/docs)\r\n- \uD83C\uDFA8 Wireframes and designs for Meshery UI in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/SMP3zxOjZztdOLtgN4dS2W/Meshery-UI)\r\n- \uD83D\uDE4B\uD83C\uDFFE\uD83D\uDE4B\uD83C\uDFFC Questions: [Discussion Forum](http://discuss.meshery.io) and [Community Slack](https://slack.meshery.io)\r\n",

But on the web (via `flutter run -d chrome` or dartpad) this method always returns -1.\nI also found two strange behaviors (potential bugs?).\n1. `frameNumber` has the old value until the end of the transientCallbacks phase. If this is not a bug, it should be documented. The picture below shows a different number in different callbacks during a frame. (underlined in blue)\n2.  `scheduleMicrotask` method calls its callback after the frame ends on the web, and not between `onBeginFrame` and `onDrawFrame` as expected (underlined in red). On the desktop (Windows) it works correctly.\n\n### Code sample\n\n<details open><summary>Code sample</summary>\n\n```dart\nimport 'dart:async';\nimport 'dart:ui';\n\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:flutter/scheduler.dart' show SchedulerBinding, Ticker;\n\nvoid main() {\n  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();\n\n  // ignore: invalid_use_of_protected_member\n  SchedulerBinding.instance.ensureFrameCallbacksRegistered();\n\n  final onBeginFrame = PlatformDispatcher.instance.onBeginFrame;\n  final onDrawFrame = PlatformDispatcher.instance.onDrawFrame;\n\n  PlatformDispatcher.instance.onBeginFrame = (Duration elapsed) {\n    print('+' * 30);\n    final frameNumber = PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber;\n    print('frameNumber from onBeginFrame callback: $frameNumber');\n    onBeginFrame!(elapsed);\n    print('___finish onBeginFrame');\n  };\n\n  PlatformDispatcher.instance.onDrawFrame = () {\n    print('___start onDrawFrame');\n    onDrawFrame!();\n    final frameNumber = PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber;\n    print('frameNumber from onDrawFrame callback: $frameNumber');\n    print('-' * 30);\n  };\n\n  runApp(const App());\n}\n\nclass App extends StatelessWidget {\n  const App({super.key});\n\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return const MaterialApp(debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false, home: Home());\n  }\n}\n\nclass Home extends StatefulWidget {\n  const Home({super.key});\n\n  @override\n  State<Home> createState() => _HomeState();\n}\n\nclass _HomeState extends State<Home> with TickerProviderStateMixin {\n  Ticker? ticker;\n\n  @override\n  void initState() {\n    super.initState();\n\n    SchedulerBinding.instance.addPersistentFrameCallback((_) {\n      final frameNumber = PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber;\n      print('frameNumber from the persistent callback: $frameNumber');\n    });\n\n    ticker = createTicker((_) {\n      final frameNumber = PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber;\n      print('frameNumber from the transient callback: $frameNumber');\n      scheduleMicrotask(() {\n        final frameNumber = PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber;\n        print('frameNumber from the microtask callback: $frameNumber');\n      });\n      SchedulerBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback((_) {\n        final frameNumber = PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber;\n        print('frameNumber from the postframe callback: $frameNumber');\n      });\n    })..start();\n\n    Timer(const Duration(seconds: 1), () {\n      ticker?.dispose();\n      ticker = null;\n    });\n  }\n\n  @override\n  void dispose() {\n    ticker?.dispose();\n    super.dispose();\n  }\n\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return const Placeholder();\n  }\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Screenshots or Video\n\n<details open>\n<summary>Screenshots / Video demonstration</summary>\n\nOn the desktop:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abca8f1d-4d88-4d5a-988e-974c58d0052e)\n\nOn the web:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fcfb6c2-ea1e-4c92-b62f-d7a800e01791)\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Logs\n\n\n\n\n### Flutter Doctor output\n\n<details open><summary>Doctor output</summary>\n\n```console\n[???] Flutter (Channel main, 3.33.0-1.0.pre.619, on Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.19045.5965], locale ru-RU)\n[???] Windows Version (????????????????????

      "description" : "# Migrate remaining CLI input methods to use @clack/prompts for consistency\n\n## \uD83C\uDFAF Summary\n\nCurrently, the CLI uses a mix of input libraries (`inquirer`, Bun's global `prompt()`, and `@clack/prompts`). We should standardize on `@clack/prompts` for a consistent user experience and better styling across all CLI interactions.\n\n## \uD83D\uDCCB Current State\n\nMost of the CLI already uses `@clack/prompts` properly, but there are **2 main files** still using other input methods:\n\n### 1. `src/utils/plugin-creator.ts` - Using `inquirer` \uD83D\uDCE6\n\nThis file has multiple `inquirer.prompt()` calls that need to be migrated:\n\n- **Plugin specification collection** (~line 172-290):\n  - Plugin name input\n  - Plugin description input  \n  - Plugin features input\n  - Component selection (checkbox)\n  - Action names input\n  - Provider names input\n  - Evaluator names input\n  - Service names input\n\n### 2. `scripts/generate-unit-tests.ts` - Using global `prompt()` \uD83D\uDD27\n\n- **Test generation confirmation** (~line 165):\n  ```typescript\n  const answer = prompt('Generate tests? (y/n): ');\n  ```\n\n## ??? Benefits of Migration\n\n1. **Consistent UX** - All CLI interactions will have the same look and feel\n2. **Better styling** - Clack provides superior visual design and animations\n3. **Better error handling** - Clack has built-in cancellation handling\n4. **Reduced dependencies** - Can remove `inquirer` from package.json\n5. **Type safety** - Better TypeScript integration\n\n## \uD83D\uDD27 Implementation Examples\n\n### For `plugin-creator.ts`:\n\n**Before (inquirer):**\n```typescript\nconst answers = await inquirer.prompt([\n  {\n    type: 'input',\n    name: 'name',\n    message: 'Plugin name (without \"plugin-\" prefix):',\n    validate: (input: string) => input.length > 0 || 'Plugin name is required'\n  }\n]);\n```\n\n**After (clack):**\n```typescript\nconst name = await clack.text({\n  message: 'Plugin name (without \"plugin-\" prefix):',\n  validate: (input) => input.length > 0 ? undefined : 'Plugin name is required'\n});\n\nif (clack.isCancel(name)) {\n  clack.cancel('Operation cancelled.');\n  process.exit(0);\n}\n```\n\n### For `generate-unit-tests.ts`:\n\n**Before:**\n```typescript\nconst answer = prompt('Generate tests? (y/n): ');\n```\n\n**After:**\n```typescript\nconst answer = await clack.confirm({\n  message: 'Generate tests?',\n  initialValue: true\n});\n\nif (clack.isCancel(answer)) {\n  console.log('Cancelled.');\n  return;\n}\n```\n\n## ??? Reference Files (Already Using Clack)\n\nThese files are already properly implemented and serve as good examples:\n- `src/commands/create/actions/creators.ts`\n- `src/commands/create/index.ts`\n- `src/commands/env/actions/edit.ts`\n- `src/commands/publish/utils/validation.ts`\n- `src/utils/cli-prompts.ts`\n\n## ??? Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Replace all `inquirer.prompt()` calls in `plugin-creator.ts` with clack equivalents\n- [ ] Replace global `prompt()` call in `generate-unit-tests.ts` with clack\n- [ ] Remove `inquirer` dependency from `package.json` if no longer used elsewhere\n- [ ] Ensure all prompts handle cancellation properly (ctrl+c)\n- [ ] Test plugin creation flow works identically to current behavior\n- [ ] Test unit test generation script works identically to current behavior\n- [ ] Maintain existing validation logic and error messages\n- [ ] Update any related TypeScript types if needed\n\n## \uD83C\uDFAF Priority\n\n**Medium** - This improves developer experience and code consistency but doesn't affect core functionality.\n\n## \uD83D\uDCA1 Implementation Notes\n\n- The `generate-unit-tests.ts` part would be a good **beginner-friendly** task\n- The `plugin-creator.ts` part is more complex due to multiple sequential prompts\n- Consider breaking this into two separate PRs if needed\n- Make sure to test the checkbox selection for component types in plugin creation\n\n---\n\n**Note**: The majority of the CLI already uses clack properly - this is just cleaning up the last few stragglers to ensure complete consistency across the entire CLI experience.",

There are just a few more of these left, could you help us finish this?", "@jameslamb sure thing, all of these appear to be fixed except for the final `raises` in `test_dask.py`, which I've just opened a PR for. To help add the corr. PR in the issue [OP](https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/issues/6860#issue-2908975971) to the remaining unchecked `raises` by file:\n\n- `test_basic.py`\n   - Remaining `raises`: https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/pull/6893\n- `test_dask.py`\n   - First two `raises`: https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/pull/6893\n   - Last `raises`: https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/pull/6955\n- `test_sklearn.py`\n   - All `raises`: https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/pull/6929\n\nAlso to enforce error messages when testing for errors in the future I believe we can:\n\n- Python package: Add [ruff's `PT011`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/pytest-raises-too-broad/) to the `pyproject.toml` file\n   - Alternatively, we could enforce the entire [flake8-pytest-style (`PT`)](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/#flake8-pytest-style-pt) collection of linters, though there are currently 27 related errors so if we want to enforce this we'd have to do a little work before updating the linting config for the sake of CI checks (please see \"All PT Errors\" below). Plus, some of these are naturally subjective styling so not sure if we necessarily want to enforce them.\n- R package: Keeping track of adding this linter to `lintr` in https://github.com/r-lib/lintr/issues/2870\n   - Doesn't currently exist for [`testthat` linters](https://lintr.r-lib.org/reference/pkg_testthat_linters.html)\n   - If maintainers deem useful, I can add that in to `lintr` and afterwards update in this project and add that to the list of R linters we use\n\nSo please let me know if you'd like me to make the immediate proposed change to the python linting config (adding `PT011`) and if so, if you'd like me to do it as part of this issue or open up a separate issue.\n\n<details><summary>All PT

I apologize, looks like I was not doing as good a job of keeping the list in the description up to date as I thought. I just updated all of those and approved  + merged #6955.\n\n> _we could enforce the entire [flake8-pytest-style (PT)](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/#flake8-pytest-style-pt) collection of linters_\n> _..._\n> _ let me know if you'd like me to make the immediate proposed change to the python linting config_\n\nThanks so much for the thorough explanation. I love the idea of introducing `ruff`'s `PT011` to help enforce this stuff, and I'd support just immediately doing that (no need to create a new issue).\n\nLooks like it even caught one overly-broad exception that I missed in this issue:\n\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/blob/e7c6c4371b5d725902a09a80b4d6c36e432a4381/tests/python_package_test/test_dask.py#L1233\n\nI'd support PRs (or even a single PR, if you'd prefer) that introduced `PT` in the list here:\n\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/blob/e7c6c4371b5d725902a09a80b4d6c36e432a4381/python-package/pyproject.toml#L141\n\nThese look like some great suggestions... for example, only putting `with pytest.raises()` around the 1 statement that raises the exception is really helpful, and something @StrikerRUS has advised me on before. Would be great to enforce that automatically!\n\nBut please add the following to the `ignore` list\n\n* \"PT007 Wrong values type in `pytest.mark.parametrize` expected `list` of `tuple`\"\n  - *I do not really understand this one... a `tuple` is a little safer because it's immutable*\n* \"PT003 `scope='function'` is implied in `@pytest.fixture()`\"\n  - *I like being able to read the code and knowing it's a function-scoped fixture, not needing to remember what the default is*\n\n> _I can add that in to lintr and afterwards update in this project and add that to the list of R linters we use_\n\nThanks for opening that `{lintr}` issue.\n\nIf that idea is accepted and implemented there, I'd support using it here in LightGBM. I understand and agree with some of the concerns @MichaelChirico raised there, but for `{lightgbm}` (where our `expect_error()` tests are mostly catching our own first-party error messages), I'd like this linter's help and I'd be willing to to pay the slight maintenance cost of `# nolint` comments on any `expect_error()` calls catching errors raised by other libraries.\n\nTotally up to you if working on that in `{lintr}` interests you!", "@jameslamb Sounds good! I've opened up a PR to add \"PT\" to our linting config in #6959.\n\nI intend to work on the `lintr` issue, though I've chosen to automatically close this issue once #6959 is merged, since getting the R linter into `lintr` and having it be released in a new version so we can bump the `lintr` version in this project and use it will likely take some time, so I imagine we could specifically track that in a new issue.\n\nIf you'd instead prefer to keep this existing issue open to track the R linting config changes, just let me know!", "Thanks!\n\nYeah let's let #6959 close this issue. No need to create a new issue here for the `{lintr}` stuff, since that isn't even guaranteed to be merged... It would be ok with me if you just open a PR here in the future introducing the new linter(s) and bumping the version, similar to https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/pull/6471" ],

Please describe.**\nInfinistore supports Ethernet and Infiniband, but LMCache hard-codes the link type to Ethernet when setting up its Infinistore connection. This limits the usefulness of the Infinistore backend.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nI would like to add a configuration parameter (maybe `infinistore_link` or `infinistore_link_type`) that allows choosing Ethernet or Infiniband at runtime.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nCurrently I work around this by editing the hard-coded link type value. This is not a great solution for folks who are not building from source.\n\n**Additional context**\nI am happy to make this change if maintainers agree it should be made.\n",

      "comments" : [ "+1 - we just ran into a problem related the fleet integrations when upgrading our entire stack from 8.15 -> 8.18\n\nI think because of the \"auto update\", the apm server integration got upgraded to 8.18 automatically, this broke our terraform state because it couldn't find the apm server integration 8.15.\n\nWe had to manipulate state to remove it, then found out that `terrafom import` is not supported for this resource type, so we had to manually go in kibana and delete the integration, so then terraform was able to proceed and create it.\n\nThis is really cumbersome\nIt's the first time we've ran into this because it's the first upgrade after we introduced terraform to manage our elastic stack.\n", "Plus, I'm wondering if it's even worth to have the integrations controlled by terraform, because when you bump the version, terraform tries to remove the integration and add a new one, but this fails because you cannot remove integrations that have a policy assigned to it.\n\nThis really breaks the whole point of automating this.\nAs a paying customer, I'm really disappointed that the terraform provider just seem like an afterthought, and there is really no other good alternative to maintain a bunch of elastic/kibana internal resources through IaC ", "It is a reasonable question to be asked, if it does make sense to manage the fleet integrations with Terraform. We do it for one of our setups since roughly 9 months and there are some challenges attached to it. The main reason we still do it is, that it helps us to keep everything under control between the 3 deployments (dev, test, prod).\n\nWhat we find challenging is to perform updates of the fleet integrations. We normally execute the update manually on dev and then \"backport\" the changes to Terraform by analyzing the differences in the execution plan. The main challenge there is rooted in the fact, that some of the properties (for example `vars`, if I recall correctly) are marked as sensitive in Terraform and therefore Terraform refuses to show the differences even if the property might not contain any sensitive value for some of the fleet integrations (where others actually do store sensitive values in this property). Since analyzing the differences in the JSON output of the Terraform plan became very painful (especially, since the values are JSON in JSON), we even built our own tool to assist with this (https://github.com/breml/tfreveal).\n\nThe bottom line is, that with the use of fleet integrations one faces the challange, that there are two different systems (Terraform and the install/update mechanism of Fleet), which change the state and therefore there is always drift, that one needs to handle in Terraform. Sofar we made it work, but compared with other systems, that we manage with Terraform, this is for sure one of the more painful ones." ],

The trade-off being higher confidence we have no flakes.\n\nI  think we can keep local test runs (by default) to continue to run with `-count=1` (the default) ie. `make unit-test`. And so no changes for local dev.\n\nBut given the frequency of flakey test runs, I do think it is worth it to run CI with `-count=2`. It will slow CI down, but flakey/buggy tests will likely fail checks. And if we have access to bigger build workers(?), I think that would help reduce the time (bigger workers = more CPUs = more tests running in parallel).\n\n(ill put this comment on https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/31013#pullrequestreview-2975837738 as well)\n\nThe final option would be to only run with a higher count upon merging to main. If we really don't want to impact CI times by this much. Thoughts?" ],

During the first stage of training, the strong information bottleneck created by the VQ-VAE codebook forces the learned latent actions to capture only the information not inferable from task instructions???resulting in task-irrelevant latent actions.\n\nIn the second stage, with these task-irrelevant latents frozen, the newly initialized latent actions are trained to replace the role of language, allowing them to learn task-centric dynamics.\n\nThis also explains why, in naive latent action learning approaches like LAPA and Genie, latent action tokens mostly encode motion/dynamics???since texture information is already preserved from previous frames for future frame prediction in the decoder.

Explicit contrastive alignment could harm convergence in this case, as it may be more suitable for learning latent actions that represent the entire task rollout rather than individual steps.", "> [@retsuh-bqw](https://github.com/retsuh-bqw) Thanks for your detailed explanation.\n> \n> To support your claims, I think it would be helpful to demonstrate what kind of behavior the latent actions actually exhibit.

While we cannot perform explicit reconstruction (since LAM operates in DINO space rather than raw pixels), we have conducted related analyses:\n\n- Figures 8 & A-1 demonstrate that latent actions exhibit semantic consistency across environments and embodiments.\n\n- Figure A-3 explores the attention patterns between latent actions and DINO features." ],

      "description" : "**1. Overview:**\n\nEnsure robust and up-to-date integration of the OpenAI API as a core LLM provider within the `voltagent` framework, utilizing the official `openai` Node.js SDK. This involves verifying support for the latest OpenAI models (GPT-4, GPT-3.5 variants), features (like tool calling, JSON mode), and ensuring the implementation aligns perfectly with the `LLMProvider` interface and `voltagent` conventions.\n\n**2. Goals:**\n\n*   Implement or verify a dedicated `OpenAIProvider` class adhering to the `LLMProvider` interface.\n*   Support core generation functionalities (`generateText`, `streamText`, `generateObject`, `streamObject`) using OpenAI models.\n*   Utilize the latest official `openai` Node.js SDK.\n*   Correctly map `voltagent` generation options (model, temperature, max tokens, tool choice, etc.) to OpenAI API parameters.\n*   Implement robust support for OpenAI's tool calling mechanism, mapping seamlessly to `voltagent`'s tool definition and execution flow.\n*   Support OpenAI's JSON mode for reliable structured output generation (`generateObject`/`streamObject`).\n*   Handle authentication using OpenAI API keys.\n*   Integrate OpenAI-specific error handling and response parsing.\n\n**3. Proposed Architecture & Components:**\n\n*   **`OpenAIProvider`:** A class (potentially existing but needing review/update) within `agent/providers` implementing `LLMProvider`. It should:\n    *   Use the official `openai` Node.js library.\n    *   Handle API client initialization (API key, potentially base URL for proxies).\n    *   Implement `generateText`, `streamText`, `generateObject`, `streamObject`, correctly formatting requests (messages, tools, model parameters) and parsing responses/streams.\n    *   Specifically handle the `tool_calls` and `tool_results` message flow for tool usage.\n*   **Provider Registration:** Ensure `OpenAIProvider` is correctly registered and selectable.\n*   **Configuration:** Allow users to select 'openai' as the provider, specify models (e.g., 'gpt-4-turbo', 'gpt-3.5-turbo'), and provide API keys.\n*   **Tool Mapping:** Refine the logic that translates `voltagent` tool definitions into the format expected by the OpenAI API's `tools` parameter and processes `tool_calls` responses.\n\n**4. Affected Core Modules:**\n\n*   `agent/providers`: `OpenAIProvider` class implementation/refinement.\n*   `agent/types`: Ensure types accurately reflect OpenAI's request/response structures, especially for tools.\n*   `ToolManager`: Interaction with `OpenAIProvider` for formatting tool definitions and handling tool calls.\n*   `Agent`/`Agent Options`: Configuration for provider selection, models, and credentials.\n*   Requires the `openai` dependency.\n\n**5. Acceptance Criteria (Initial MVP / Refinement):**\n\n*   Users can configure an `Agent` to use `OpenAIProvider` with various GPT models (e.g., GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-3.5 Turbo) and an API key.\n*   `agent.generateText()` and `agent.streamText()` work correctly.\n*   `agent.generateObject()` and `agent.streamObject()` utilize OpenAI's JSON mode successfully.\n*   Agents can reliably use tools defined in `voltagent`, with requests and responses correctly handled via the OpenAI tool calling API.\n*   Relevant options (temperature, max tokens, tool choice) are passed correctly.\n*   Integration uses the current version of the official `openai` SDK.\n*   Documentation reflects the updated/verified OpenAI integration details.\n\n**6. Potential Challenges & Considerations:**\n\n*   Keeping up with frequent updates and changes in the OpenAI API and SDK.\n*   Ensuring the tool calling implementation is robust and handles various edge cases (multiple tool calls, errors).\n*   Mapping `voltagent`'s internal state/history accurately to the sequence of messages expected by OpenAI, especially when including tool results.\n*   Handling differences in behavior or features across different OpenAI models.\n*   Cost management and monitoring token usage for OpenAI API calls.",

      "description" : "Add \"Rename\" Button for Preset Management with Popup Modal\r\n\r\n**Description:**\r\nWe need to add a \"Rename\" button between the ComboBox (for selecting presets) and the \"Delete\" button. When clicked, this button should open a popup modal asking the user to enter a new name for the selected preset. Upon confirming, the preset's name should be updated in the object (`presets.name`) and the associated file. The previous file with the old name should be deleted.\r\n\r\n**Tasks:**\r\n\r\n1. **Add the \"Rename\" button:**\r\n   - Place the \"Rename\" button between the ComboBox (preset selector) and the \"Delete\" button.\r\n   - Ensure the button is clearly labeled and fits within the existing layout.\r\n\r\n2. **Implement the popup modal:**\r\n   - Create a modal that appears when the \"Rename\" button is clicked.\r\n   - The modal should include:\r\n     - An input field for the new preset name.\r\n     - \"Confirm\" and \"Cancel\" buttons.\r\n   - The \"Confirm\" button should only be enabled if the input field is not empty.\r\n\r\n3. **Handle renaming logic:**\r\n   - Update the `presets.name` property with the new name when the user clicks \"Confirm\".\r\n   - Rename the corresponding preset file to match the new name and delete the old file.\r\n   - Ensure the file renaming is done safely, checking for any name conflicts or invalid characters.\r\n\r\n4. **Update the ComboBox selection and display:**\r\n   - Refresh the ComboBox options to reflect the updated preset name.\r\n   - Maintain the current selection in the ComboBox with the new name after renaming.\r\n\r\n5. **Test the renaming functionality:**\r\n   - Verify that the \"Rename\" button opens the modal correctly.\r\n   - Test renaming with various inputs (valid, invalid, empty, conflicting names).\r\n   - Confirm that the file is renamed correctly and the old file is deleted.\r\n   - Ensure the ComboBox updates to reflect the new name without issues.\r\n\r\n6. **Update documentation:**\r\n   - Document the new \"Rename\" functionality.\r\n   - Update any relevant sections of the user guide to explain how to rename presets.\r\n\r\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\r\n- The \"Rename\" button appears between the ComboBox and \"Delete\" button and functions as intended.\r\n- The popup modal asks the user for a new name, and the \"Confirm\" button only works when a valid name is provided.\r\n- The preset's name is updated both in the object (`presets.name`) and the corresponding file.\r\n- The previous file is deleted after renaming.\r\n- The ComboBox correctly displays the updated preset name.\r\n- Documentation is updated to reflect the new feature.\r\n\r\n**Additional Context:**\r\n- The project uses ImGui, and the modal should integrate seamlessly with the existing UI.\r\n- Ensure that renaming presets does not interfere with other functionalities like saving, loading, or deleting presets.",

Additionally, OpenAI seems to strangely bounce you back-and-forth between two equally obscure error messages if you cut-and-paste the error & ask for assistance.\n\nHey Jeremy, sure, as an example, in pyproject.toml the `tool.poetry.source` section must be an array, like `[[tool.poetry.source]]` even if you only specify one source. This makes total sense as arrays with 1 entry are completely valid.  \n\nThe confusion is that poetry will give you the error in my original message, which tells you something should be an array but not _which_ something, so the solution currently is just to review your pyproject.toml file very carefully with respect to what each tool you have using it expects.", "We already replace `data.` with `tool.poetry.` in https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry-core/blob/002aa3e16f98d21645bb9a45f698b55adc40f317/src/poetry/core/factory.py#L606-L609.\n\nWe probably have to do the same in https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/blob/aeaa3d09ce7381bf34ac7e0ac27b929841256c90/src/poetry/factory.py#L335." ],

So you can just simply start working with the issue right away!*\r\n\r\n## How to get started\r\nOpen the `tasks/yaml/medium` directory from the root of your project.\r\nThen open up the `docker-compose.yml` file and once it is properly created according to the YAML syntax and the task in hand, you are done and ready to make a pull request!\r\n*Note: You can test your YAML code in a editor like [this](http://www.yamllint.com/)*.\r\n\r\n## Description:\r\n\r\nYour task is to create a `docker-compose.yml` file that describes a multi-service application. This application should contain:\r\n\r\n-   A web server running on port 8080 using the nginx image.\r\n-   A database server running on the default port using the postgres image.\r\n\r\nThe web server should have access to the database server but not vice versa.\r\n\r\n## Requirements:\r\n\r\n-   Use Docker Compose version 3.\r\n-   Specify service names, image versions, and exposed ports.\r\n-   Set up a custom network and make sure only the web server can communicate with the database.\r\n-   Use environment variables to set the database name, user, and password for the PostgreSQL service.\r\n\r\n## Example Structure:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nversion: '3'\r\n\r\nservices:\r\n  # Define your services here\r\n  \r\nnetworks:\r\n  # Define your networks here\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Evaluation Criteria:\r\n\r\n-   Valid YAML syntax.\r\n-   Correct use of Docker Compose version and features.\r\n-   Correct network setup.\r\n-   The web server should be able to connect to the database, but the database should not have access to the web server.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions and how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

It is clear that many contributors are not reading the contributing.MD or the documentation update readme. \n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nWe are a welcoming community and we would like to include all regardless of their learning methodology. Some read, others watch. So, we would like a video to welcome contributors and walk them through the basics of contributing to KubeStellar. Once completed, we can create a shortcut url and give it to anyone with a question about making a contribution. This saves everyone time.\n\n### Are you willing to contribute?\n\n- [ ] Yes, I'd like to help implement this feature.\n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_",

The actions-user bot will reset the file back to previous state for the next contributor after your commit is merged.

If the available space falls below a certain threshold, the script should send an email alert to a specified email address.\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\n-   Threshold for low disk space should be configurable (e.g., below 20%).\r\n-   The email should contain detailed information about the disk space status.\r\n-   Use the `df` command for getting disk space information.\r\n-   Use `mail` command to send email.\r\n\r\nNext step is optional but if you would like to make this actually functional for email sending, you could use for example the mail command-line utility for that:\r\n\r\nOn Linux/Ubuntu:\r\n```bash\r\nsudo apt-get install mailutils\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn macOS:\r\n```bash\r\nbrew install mailutils\r\n```\r\n\r\n### To run the script:\r\n\r\nMake sure you are in the correct directory with the command:\r\n```bash\r\ncd tasks/bash/medium\r\n```\r\n\r\nEnsure you have the required permissions to execute the script by running this command:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nchmod +x disk_monitor.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nExecute the script:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./disk_monitor.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo work with this issue, you need to have Bash installed to your local machine.\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions of installing Bash and how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

The actions-user bot will reset the file back to previous state for the next contributor after your commit is merged. So you can just simply start working with the issue right away!*\r\n\r\n## How to get started\r\n\r\nFor this task you need to have Python and NumPy installed. Check out [Installing Python](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge#installing-python) section in README if you need to install Python. If you already have Python installed, you can install NumPy using pip (Python's package installer) with the following terminal command:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npip install numpy\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr, if you're using Python 3 specifically and have both Python 2 and Python 3 installed, you may need to use:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npip3 install numpy\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter that you can open the `tasks/python/hard` directory from the root of the project. \r\nThen open `decision_tree.py` file and start working on your solution!\r\n\r\n![python-hard](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/assets/82566656/3fc4a704-a734-4b90-90fc-476ab367b7a1)\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nImplement a Decision Tree Classifier from scratch using Python. Do not use libraries like scikit-learn that have pre-implemented classifiers; instead, use basic libraries like NumPy for numerical calculations.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\n\r\n-   Understand the theory behind Decision Trees.\r\n-   Implement a simple yet functional Decision Tree Classifier.\r\n-   Test the classifier on a dataset.\r\n\r\nUse any freely available classification dataset. Ensure the dataset has at least 3 features and at least 2 classes.\r\n\r\nImplementation Steps:\r\n-   Write functions to calculate Gini impurity or Information Gain.\r\n-   Implement a class DecisionTree with methods for fitting and predicting.\r\n-   Implement a function to print/visualize the tree.\r\n\r\nTesting:\r\n-   Split the dataset into training and test sets and evaluate your classifier.\r\n\r\nAcceptance Criteria:\r\n\r\n-   Successfully implement a Decision Tree Classifier from scratch.\r\n-   Evaluate the classifier on a dataset, showing reasonable performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).\r\n\r\nResources:\r\n\r\n-   [Decision Trees - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning)\r\n\r\n## How to run\r\n\r\nMake sure you are in the right directory:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncd tasks/python/hard\r\n```\r\n\r\nExecute the following command to run your Python script:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npython decision_tree.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected output\r\n\r\nOutput should look similar to this:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nThe predicted class for the sample [0.4, 0.6] is 0.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the output looks correct, you are ready to make a pull request!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo work with this issue, you need to have Python installed to your local machine.\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions of installing Python and how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

      "comments" : [ "<!-- Answer -->\nThis issue is caused by a disconnect between the context available to Jinja templates during regular chart rendering and what is provided during drill-to-detail actions. When you drill, the frontend sends a new request that often lacks the full dashboard/global context (like dashboard filters or URL params) that your Jinja SQL expects, so the template renders incorrectly or with missing values. This is a known limitation and has been discussed in several issues and code reviews ([example](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/33591), [example](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/33579)).\n\nA workaround is to make your Jinja SQL more robust by using `if/else` blocks to provide default values when filters are missing, so the query always returns results and columns don't disappear. For example:\n\n```sql\nWITH calculation as (\n  SELECT count(*), country\n  FROM \"Vehicle Sales\"\n  WHERE 1=1\n  {% if filter_values('product_line') %}\n    and product_line in {{ filter_values('product_line')|where_in }}\n  {% else %}\n    and product_line = 'Classic Cars'\n  {% endif %}\n  GROUP BY country\n)\nSELECT * FROM calculation\n```\n([source](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/33591))\n\nIf your dataset relies on dashboard-level filters or variables, you may need to adjust your Jinja logic to handle cases where those are missing during drill actions.\n\nThere have also been recent changes to how Superset syncs dataset columns and processes Jinja templates, which can impact this behavior ([PR 30903](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/30903)). Make sure your configuration enables `ENABLE_TEMPLATE_PROCESSING` and that your feature flags are up to date.\n\nAt this time, there is no full workaround for preserving all dashboard context in drill-to-detail requests, but making your Jinja SQL more defensive can help avoid empty or broken results.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

Because Longhorn mutator webhook requires providing [the correct `metadata.labels`](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn-manager/blob/16f796214eb359cdb9f9efbe577a2de68144081b/webhook/resources/backup/mutator.go#L63-L67) while the doc does not mention that.\n\nThere are 2 solutions for this:\n- Simply updating the doc by adding `metadata.labels` for the example YAMLs\n- The mutator should figure out and set up the labels automatically based on the input `spec.snapshotName`\n\nNow I may prefer the latter one since this solution can both\n- provide a better user experience\n- and forcibly ask the mutator to check the volume and snapshot existence before backup creation\n\n### To Reproduce\n\n1. Create and attach a volume\n2. Create a random snapshot\n3. Apply the following backup YAML provided by the doc:\n```\napiVersion: longhorn.io/v1beta2\nkind: Backup\nmetadata:\n  name: backup-example\n  namespace: longhorn-system\nspec:\n  backupMode: full\n  snapshotName: <volume snapshot name>\n  labels:\n    app: test\n```\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe backup should be created correctly\n\n### Support Bundle for Troubleshooting\n\n```\nubuntu:~$ kubectl apply -f backup.yaml\nError from server (InternalError): error when creating \"backup.yaml\": Internal error occurred: failed calling webhook \"mutator.longhorn.io\": failed to call webhook: post \"https://longhorn-admission-webhock.longhorn-system.svc:9502/v1/webhook/mutation?timeout=10s\": EOF\n```\n\n### Environment\n\n- Longhorn version: master-head (07/02/2025)\n\n### Additional context\n\nThis issue was found by community contributor @nzhan126  when she tried to test a backup-related fix. \n\n### Workaround and Mitigation\n\nSet up `matadata.labels` for the backup YAML. For example:\n```\napiVersion: longhorn.io/v1beta2\nkind: Backup\nmetadata:\n  name: backup-example\n  namespace: longhorn-system\n  labels:\n    backup-volume: <volume name>\nspec:\n  backupMode: full\n  snapshotName: <volume snapshot name>\n  labels:\n    app: test\n```\n",

      "description" : "<!-- (At least include the following, feel free to add if you have more content) -->\n\n## Feature request\n\nStarRocks support several functions to inspect the metadata of segment files:\n```sql\nselect count(id) from t1 [_META_];\nselect min(id) from t1 [_META_];\nselect max(id) from t1 [_META_];\nselect flat_json_meta(payload) from t1 [_META_];\n```\n\nEssentially it generates a `META_SCAN` operator to scan the metadata of underlying segment files, then aggregate the result with `count/min/max` functions.\n\nWe can leverage this mechanism to inspect the column size of a table, for example:\n\n```sql\nselect column_size(id) from t1 [_META_];\n```\n\nThere are several types of column sizes:  \n- **Uncompressed Size**: Stored in the `ColumnMetaPB` located in the segment footer.  \n- **Compressed Size**: Represents the on-disk size. While it is not explicitly stored in the footer, it can be estimated by analyzing the number of pages via the `OrdinalIndex` and calculating the average page size.  \n\nIt might be worthwhile to include a few functions for inspecting a column's metadata.\n\nFurther more, we can also consider add these column stats into the optimizer statistics system, stored in the `_statistics_.column_statistics` table.\n\n",

As of now, Souvlaki leaves it up to the user to change the URL depending on the platform.\r\n\r\nFor Linux, we follow the MPRIS specification, which actually doesn't say much cover art apart from what's in [here](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/mpris-spec/metadata/#mpris:arturl). It only says that local files should start with `file://` and that it should be an UTF-8 string, which is enforced by Rust. Maybe you can look in the source code of desktop managers such as GNOME or KDE, since these read the field to display it on their media player controls.\r\n\r\nFor Windows, we use the _SystemMediaTransportControlsDisplayUpdater_, which has [a thumbnail property](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.media.systemmediatransportcontrolsdisplayupdater.thumbnail?view=winrt-22621#windows-media-systemmediatransportcontrolsdisplayupdater-thumbnail). It accepts multiple formats, but we choose to create it using an URI. If setting an URL starting with `file://`, the file is automatically loaded by souvlaki.\r\n\r\nFor MacOS, you can look into [these lines](https://github.com/Sinono3/souvlaki/blob/384539fe83e8bf5c966192ba28e9405e3253619b/src/platform/macos/mod.rs#L131-L137) of the implementation. These lines refer to creating an [MPMediaItemArtwork](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mediaplayer/mpmediaitemartwork) object.\r\n\r\nI hope this is of use to you.

      "description" : "Following in the footsteps of the lifecycle publisher, enable the subscription, action server, action client, service server, and service client to have an activate and deactivate method for lifecycle enablement.\n\nThese should be added as managed entities and update the Nav2 Task Servers to call a new method `nav2::LifecycleNode::activateInterfaces()` and complimentary in deactivation so that these are all automatically activated and deactivated behind the scenes. Update the task servers to remove the manual activation and deactivation. We do need to take some care that the instantiation of the interfaces then are ordered since some subscription callbacks might depend on some publishers activation or existence. So we should be creating all exporters (i.e. action clients, service clients, publishers) before  consumers (i.e. actions, services, subscribers) -- and deactivating all consumers before exporters (inverted). \n\nOn top, in the nav2 lifecycle node, we should autoactivate if the node is already activated when an interface is created (see `nav2::Publisher` for example)\n\n",

      "description" : "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\nOn NixOS, process commands are always very long because everything is located in the Nix store under a cryptographically-hashed prefix (see screenshot). Even at a very high resolution (3840x1600 in my case) with btop maximized, and the left panel hidden, it's impossible to see the full command much of the time.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nI'd like to be able to specify a prefix (maybe regex) to exclude some parts of the process command. For example, instead of `/nix/store/<long string>/bin/.firefox-wrapped --name firefox`, I could configure it to just show `bin/firefox-wrapped --name firefox`.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nUsing a different distro would solve this but I don't wanna.\n\n**Additional context**\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c08d3137-e71b-492c-b81c-1c86827c9803)",

Please @MisterJimson provide us a repository to test ", "Hello @MisterJimson, please provide a minimal reproduction. You can use one of the following options:\n\n- Provide a link to [our playground](https://biomejs.dev/playground), if it's applicable.\n- Provide a link to GitHub repository. To easily create a reproduction, you can use our interactive CLI via `npm create @biomejs/biome-reproduction`\n\nIssues marked with `S-Needs repro` will be **closed** if they have **no activity within 3 days**.", "I'm actually on the fence whether this should be considered a false positive at all. Files that either accidentally or intentionally import/export from themselves _are_ creating a cycle, albeit a very small one. In many cases I think people want to be alerted about this, so I think this isn't an issue, although you could open a discussion whether we should have an option for this case.\n\nWhat actually worries me more is why it's not being reported in your IDE \uD83E\uDD14 ", "FYI This case isn't marked as a cycle in eslint. And oxc has the same bug and are fixing it: https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/issues/11646\n\nWe are switching to whichever project fixes it first.", "FYI @arendjr, if we want to keep the existing behaviour, we should change the rule metadata and mark it as inspired. Currently, it is marked as \"the same as\". ", "I just tried it in both node and bun. Both allow the file to import itself without blowing up.\n\nAlthough I tend to agree that this would be a code smell. I imagine the goal of the original rule was to alert for things that would crash and burn.", "Does anyone have a suggested alternative approach that preserves similar syntax?\n\n```ts\nexport function example1() {\n  return 1;\n}\n\nexport function example2() {\n  return 2;\n}\n\nexport * as Example from './test';\n\n// usage example\nimport { Example } from '@package/test'\n\nconst value = Example.example2();\n```\n\nThe goal is to have namespaced functions.", "You could put all the functions in a static class, and then just export the class.", "That's an idea. Would need to disable https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-static-only-class/  though.\n\nThe other thing to consider is tree shaking. If it's purely an import style like I have now, I believe fully unused functions are still able to be removed. Would the same be true for a static class?

This weekend I tried to set up a local IPv6 network by using VirtualBox, but not successful.\r\n\r\nI checked our servers and found the IPv6 address of `docker0` is like `fe80::aaaa:bbbb:cccc:dddd`, not `fe80::1` you showed. I'm not sure if this is an issue?\r\n\r\nFrom the document [IPv6 with Docker | Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/v17.09/engine/userguide/networking/default_network/ipv6/) we can see that the IPv6 address of `docker0` is like `2001:db8::c008/125`.\r\n\r\nSo sorry, I cannot help you now. But I would like to try IPv6 when I have time.\r\n\r\nIf you have any updates please let me know, thanks!", "@chaifeng thank you for your timely response. I took a look at the documentation you mentioned and made the changes that they describe. It now looks like the docker0 interface has two versions of an IPv6 address. I will admit i'm pretty new to firewalls and very new to ufw so i'm not even sure what the best way to debug this would be. I don't really need IPV6 container support and I think it would be better to have the IPV6 requests to my server to be forwarded as IPV4, but i'm not sure how to do that. \r\n\r\nThe reason I found this issue was because I was unable to access my website from my phone when not connected to WIFI. My LTE connection has an IPV6 address which makes my site unreachable.\r\n\r\nifconfig: \r\n```\r\ndocker0: flags=4099<UP,BROADCAST,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500\r\n        inet 172.17.0.1  netmask 255.255.0.0  broadcast 172.17.255.255\r\n        inet6 fe80::1  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>\r\n        inet6 2001:db8:1::1  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x0<global>\r\n        ether 02:42:0e:75:6d:9a  txqueuelen 0  (Ethernet)\r\n        RX packets 0  bytes 0 (0.0 B)\r\n        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0\r\n        TX packets 0  bytes 0 (0.0 B)\r\n        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have updated my after6.rules to reflect the new address:\r\n```\r\n# BEGIN UFW AND DOCKER\r\n*filter\r\n:ufw6-user-forward - [0:0]\r\n:DOCKER-USER - [0:0]\r\n-A DOCKER-USER -j RETURN -s 2001:db8:1::/64\r\n-A DOCKER-USER -p udp -m udp --sport 53 --dport 1024:65535 -j RETURN\r\n\r\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw6-user-forward\r\n\r\n-A DOCKER-USER -j DROP -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,ACK SYN -d 2001:db8:1::/64\r\n-A DOCKER-USER -j DROP -p udp -m udp --dport 0:32767 -d 2001:db8:1::/64\r\n\r\n-A DOCKER-USER -j RETURN\r\nCOMMIT\r\n# END UFW AND DOCKER\r\n```\r\n\r\nI enabled ufw logging and I can still see the request being blocked.

Exactly like the goal of `ufw` is to block network access to processes running on the host from whatever network is attached to the host.\nThe network attached to the host can be public (typical of a public server rented from a provider) or private (typical of a home or company network).\nEven if your network is private, for whatever reason you might want to block access to a container (or to a specific port of that container) from that network and only allow access to it from the docker host.\nThe above is true regardless of whether your docker host has IPv4 or IPv6 (or both) on its network interface(s). You'll have to deal with separate and independent block rules for IPv4 and IPv6.\n\nIf your docker host is on a private network behind a router/firewall and you are happy for whatever container to be accessible from that private network, you may disregard `ufw-docker` completely and only use your router/firewall to control access from the public internet (or other private networks).\nThe above is also true regardless of whether your internet provider provides you with IPv4 or IPv6 (or both) connectivity. With home IPv4 connectivity there is typically NAT between the public internet and your private network that blocks inbound connections by default. If your ISP also provides you with IPv6 connectivity, that's typically not the case (afaik) and you really need to make sure your firewall (OpenWRT) has specific IPv6 rules in place to block all inbound connections by default and only allow the connections you want.", "this pr was merged https://github.com/chaifeng/ufw-docker/pull/92" ],

Issue?????????????????????????????????:)\n- [x] Please do not modify this template :) and fill in all the required fields.\n\n### Dify version\n\n1.3.1\n\n### Cloud or Self Hosted\n\nSelf Hosted (Docker)\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n## Request Configuration\n- model : doubao-1.5-vision-pro\n- api_url: offical\n- input params: one image(file id format) and some string params (for type selection)\n- output params: just text\n- method: workflow API request\n\n## The whole step flow is\n1. upload the file to dify and get the file id\n- method: NextJS fetch method\n- request url : http://{dify-server}/v1/files/upload\n2. request the dify workflow API\n- method: NextJS fetch method\n- request url: http://{dify-server}/v1/workflows/run\n- params: image_url (Dify's id splice)\n3. get the response\n\nThe whole step is automatic. Every epoch the step will request 3 times and wait for 2 seconds.\n\n\n### ?????? Expected Behavior\n\nWhen I request the workflow API, it should give me the text result.\n\n### ??? Actual Behavior\n\nBut Sometimes the request will be error, the fetch response content is \n\n```\nTypeError: fetch failed\n  1 |\n  2 | export const DifyLLMRequest  = async (type: string, file_type: string, id: string)=>{\n> 3 |   const response = await fetch(\"http://{dify-site}/v1/workflows/run\", {\n    |                   ^\n  4 |     method: \"POST\",\n  5 |     headers: {\n  6 |       \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\", {\n  [cause]: [Error [HeadersTimeoutError]: Headers Timeout Error] \n{\n    code: 'UND_ERR_HEADERS_TIMEOUT'\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe dashboard show nothing, just the ???FAILED??? status task. When I try to find the logs, the error step just showed \"running\" status, no other outputs.\n\n\nThen I try to get the docker logs (`docker-plugin_daemon-1`), I found that the plugin is always killed, so when it restart, the related request will be down.\n\nRelated logs\n```\n2025/05/07 07:05:37 stdio.go:166: [ERROR]plugin langgenius/volcengine_maas:0.0.13 has an error on stdout: bufio.Scanner: token too long\n2025/05/07 07:05:37 run.go:132: [ERROR]plugin langgenius/volcengine_maas:0.0.13 exited with error: signal: killed\n```\n\nThe `token` in `token too long` maybe not my prompt token, because I found various size image also have the same error.\n",

This can result in a token length that exceeds the limits set by the system. Here are some steps you can take to address this issue:\n\n1. **Reduce Image Size**: Try reducing the size of the images before uploading them to Dify. This can help prevent the base64 encoded data from exceeding the token limit.\n\n2. **Check Token Limits**: Ensure that the token limits for your model and API requests are configured correctly. Dify imposes a generation length limit of 2k tokens for reasoning models, which might be relevant if your workflow involves such models <sup>[[1]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/17120)</sup>.\n\n3. **Switch Model Provider**: If you're using the `openai_api_compatible` provider, consider switching to a different model provider that might handle larger token sizes more effectively <sup>[[2]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/18657)</sup>.\n\n4. **Review Workflow Configuration**: Double-check your workflow configuration to ensure that all parameters and settings are optimized for handling the data sizes you're working with.\n\nBy implementing these suggestions, you should be able to mitigate the \"token too long\" error and improve the stability of your plugin operations.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To continue talking to [Dosu](https://dosu.dev), mention @dosu.*\n\n---\n<sup>Help Dosu learn!

      "description" : "We are in the process of moving this repository to Read the Docs, and to do that we need to convert our pages from Markdown to RST. This issue is to transfer the Onboarding section: [https://contribute.mautic.org/on-boarding](https://contribute.mautic.org/on-boarding). You can also update and improve the content on these pages if you like - do check with the team leads first to ensure it's relevant.\r\n\r\nYou can do this in the current repo, as we've got a folder set up, `/docs`, which will be used for Read The Docs.\r\n\r\nYou can build this documentation locally by cloning this repository, and following these steps: https://github.com/mautic/user-documentation/tree/5.x?tab=readme-ov-file#build-documentation-locally. Change into the /docs folder and then (assuming you have DDEV and Docker/Colima installed) type `ddev config` and select `build/html `as the root folder when configuring DDEV. Then when complete, type `ddev start` and it'll give you the link to your local testing environment.\r\n\r\nIf you need to make a link file to add an external URL, please use the command line tool 'make link'. This will generate a reference macro and a link file for you.\r\n\r\nFor internal linking check the docs on using the [:ref: role](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/cross-referencing-with-sphinx.html#the-ref-role) for linking within the same document, and using [:doc: to link across pages](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/cross-referencing-with-sphinx.html#the-doc-role).\r\n\r\n**Please note: if you see folders called .revs these are old version control files from Grav. Ignore them! (they should be deleted) and instead work on the actual files.**\r\n\r\nWhen you've converted the file/s, **they need to live within the /docs folder**. We can create a structure using sub-folders to organise the sections. You also need to add the pages to the Table of Contents in the index.rst file for them to show on the menu. Docs on the ToC can be found [here](https://sublime-and-sphinx-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/indices.html).\r\nWe highly recommend that you use VS Code with Vale installed. Let us know if you have any problems.\r\n\r\nSome useful resources: \r\n- https://sublime-and-sphinx-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest guide to Sphinx/RST formatting\r\n- https://sublime-and-sphinx-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/references.html#use-the-external-links-extension how to do external links - always check the /docs/links directory first! You can use the terminal command '`make link`' to create the link file automagically.\r\n\r\nThere are many MD to RST tools out there which can help speed up the process, however you will still need to review your output to ensure it passes our Vale grammar rules. Headings must always be unique, as well.\r\n\r\nWe use the following for headings:\r\n\r\n```\r\nH1 ###\r\nH2 ***\r\nH3 ===\r\nH4 ---\r\nH5 ~~~\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease ask in #t-education on Slack if you get stuck with anything!",

I am sorry if this topic exists already.\r\n\r\nWonderful solves this by providing some tools and some patches on top of GCC to generate `compile_commands.json` files that most IDEs can ingest, however this will further deepen BlocksDS's dependency on Wonderful.

I'm not sure what behavior clangd follows if there are different compile_flags.txt in subdirectories, but that could be a possible solution.\r\n\r\nThere's also the possibility of making a tool that generates compile_commands.json by traversing the specified source directories and creating entries with the proper arm7/arm9 flags, although something like [bear](https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear) could just be used instead (I've found it to be a bit finicky though).\r\n", "Personally, I just went for implementing `-MJ` in GCC; it's convenient but, again, this makes it incompatible with non-Wonderful toolchains, as it's a non-upstreamed patch." ],
