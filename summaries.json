This small error occurs when you first install on a system via a new bat file.\n\n### Steps to help reproduce the behavior\n\nDownload the latest release with ready to run bat-files, unzip, and first run file \"run start_windows.bat\".\n\n### Relevant logs\n\nThe first installation is interrupted. But if you run the bat-file again, the script skips the installation and just correct displays “ Disclaimer”.\n\n(The installation log has been created with the required name).\n[downloader.log](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21023120/downloader.log)\n\n### Operating system/environment\n\nWindows 11 23h2\n\n### Python Version\n\n3.13.5\n\n### Cyberdrop-DL version\n\n7.0.0\n\n### Links, references, and/or additional comments?\n\nThanks for work!",

This increased use should bring more contributions as bug reports and feature proposals.\n\n### Regression test\n(Ensure the feature doesn't cause any regressions)\n- [ ] Write adequate test cases and submit test results\n- [ ] Test results should be reviewed by a person from the team\n\n### Links / references\n\n_Please note that this was taken from GitLab, to be changed accordingly_",

Write a brief description of how you will approach the task (without using ChatGPT).\n3. Add your Telegram handler in your application (e.g., in OnlyDust or similar)\n4. Write ETA in your application\n\n\n\n## What should I do if I have a problem\n1. Try to google it before asking. Googling is taking major part of dev work \n2. If you couldn't find answer your question with Google, text your question to [dev](https://t.me/spotnet_dev/4) group with your question.\n3. Do not send DM to maintainer, it would be better and faster to ask other contributors in chat \n\n\n## How to prepare PR\n1. Check if your code [smell](https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/smells) good\n2. Add `close #<issue number>` to link your issue with your PR\n3. Do not commit changes that are unrelated to your task\n4. Check after you created PR, if you committed everything\n\n\n## Task Description\n1. Add a new service to [`docker-compose.margin.yml`](./blob/main/devops/docker-compose.margin.yml) named `notification_bot`. Configure it to build using the `Dockerfile` located in the [`telegram`](./blob/main/margin/margin_app/app/telegram) directory.\n2. After building the Compose stack, share a screenshot showing that it completed successfully.",

Please explain\n\nParameterization requires a bunch of boilerplate (`_is_parameterized_`, `_parameter_names_`, `_resolve_parameters_`, all of which just check / replace the specified member variables). It seems like something a decorator could handle well.\n\n## Describe the solution you would prefer\n\nIt'd be great if in #5985, the solution could just be \"add the decorator to `QasmUGate`\", something like \n\n```python\n@parameterizable(\"theta\", \"phi\", \"lmda\")\nclass QasmUGate(ops.Gate):\n```\n\n## How urgent is this for you? Is it blocking important work?\n\n<!-- Please choose one of the following options and remove the others -->\n**P3** – I'm not really blocked by it; it's an idea I'm proposing based on principle\n\n## Process Note\n\nFor anyone wanting to take this issue, it's probably worth a mini [RFC](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/main/docs/dev/rfc_process.md) and finding a maintainer (not me) to sponsor it before starting work (assuming this even gets to triage/accepted state). While it's probably below the \"RFC Required\" bar, I think there are enough variables, that having an approved design would be beneficial. (Some things that come to mind: What happens if only some fields are parameterizable? Can/should it work both with dataclasses and with non-dataclasses? Can the implementations be overridden in classes it's applied to? How to apply it in gate class hierarchies (e.g. at the EigenGate level or at each subtype?) Does it interact with mypy typing in any way or are type declarations independent? What's the best way to test it? Is it worth going back and retrofitting existing gates into this model?)",

      "repositoryName" : "osandov/drgn",
      "description" : "## Background\r\n\r\nWhen debugging anything related to a device driver, the first step is often finding the `struct device` that represents the device in the kernel. One way to find a device is by its sysfs path. However, drgn doesn't currently have an easy way to do that. You can _kind of_ do it with something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> path = path_lookup(\"/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:06.0/0000:04:00.0/nvme/nvme0/nvme0n1\")\r\n>>> kn = cast(\"struct kernfs_node *\", path.dentry.d_inode.i_private)\r\n>>> kobject = cast(\"struct kobject *\", kn.priv)\r\n>>> device = container_of(kobject, \"struct device\", \"kobj\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this has a few issues:\r\n\r\n* Clearly it's not convenient at all.\r\n* `path_lookup()` walks the dentry cache, which may not be populated for a particular path depending on memory pressure.\r\n* `path_lookup()` doesn't resolve symlinks (yet, see #216), so you have to use the canonical path instead of a more convenient symlink like `/sys/block/nvme0n1`.\r\n\r\nInstead, we should improve our kernfs helpers and provide sysfs-specific helpers on top of those. This can be broken down into multiple smaller features.\r\n\r\n## kernfs\r\n\r\nsysfs is actually an instance of [kernfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernfs_(Linux)), which is generic infrastructure for pseudo file systems. A kernfs filesystem comprises a tree of [`struct kernfs_node`](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/include/linux/kernfs.h?id=1d227fcc72223cbdd34d0ce13541cbaab5e0d72f#n181), each of which represents a file or directory.\r\n\r\nWe already have a few basic helpers for inspecting kernfs: https://drgn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/helpers.html#kernfs. I would like two extensions to those:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add a `kernfs_children()` helper that returns an iterator over the children of a directory in kernfs. Children are represented by [`struct kernfs_node::dir::children`](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/include/linux/kernfs.h?id=1d227fcc72223cbdd34d0ce13541cbaab5e0d72f#n156).\r\n- [ ] Extend the `kernfs_walk()` helper to follow symlinks. These are represented by [`struct kernfs_node::symlink::target_kn`](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/include/linux/kernfs.h?id=1d227fcc72223cbdd34d0ce13541cbaab5e0d72f#n171). We should probably also have a `follow_symlinks` parameter that controls what we do if the last component of a path is a symlink, similar to the Python [`os`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#files-and-directories) module.\r\n\r\n## sysfs\r\n\r\nOnce we have the kernfs changes, we can add sysfs-specific helpers that use the new kernfs features.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add a `sysfs_lookup_node()` helper that returns the `struct kernfs_node *` at a given path.\r\n- [ ] Add a `sysfs_lookup()` helper that returns the actual object (e.g., `struct device *`, `struct bus *`, etc.) represented by a given path.\r\n- [ ] Add a `sysfs_listdir()` helper that lists the names of the children of a sysfs directory at a given path.",

It also provided ability for companies to run scripts on the EC2 machines securely using it's RunCommand feature. Adding SSM RunCommand Operator to the Amazon provider package will unlock migration to Airflow from legacy job scheduling frameworks like AutoSys\n\n### Use case/motivation\n\nI work with a few customers that are in the process of migrating jobs from AutoSys and other legacy frameworks to Airflow. For these customers, a lot of their existing jobs are in shell scripts running on EC2. When they migrate to Airflow, they are looking for an easy way to lift those scripts and run on Airflow. SSHOperator could be an option for this but in many corporate environments, SSH is disabled for security reasons. One of the secure ways AWS recommends executing a remote script on EC2 is by using SSM RunCommand.\n\n### Related issues\n\n_No response_\n\n### Are you willing to submit a PR?\n\n- [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n",

So I know in the Install file for OSL it says it will work with v2_5, but wanted to check and make sure that if it's at the tail end of it, there wouldn't be issues (I wouldn't believe so, since this is the version that works with Blender currently).", "This is not an issue in your CI work, it's an actual problem in OSL where building shared libs is broken currently, oslexec does not link oslcomp, but does [something a bit naughty](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenShadingLanguage/blob/main/src/liboslexec/CMakeLists.txt#L143) and gets to the symbols it needs by including the required cpp files from oslcomp into the oslexec build. And seemingly it needs more symbols now, than it needed previously. \r\n\r\nWe ran into this today with the blender deps build (no fix as of yet), but this broke somewhere between 1.13.7.0 and the 1.14 beta \r\n\r\n", "Presumably caused by #1890.", "Potential fix in #1918, can someone check if it works?", "works\r\n ", "Okay sweet, and thanks. I will try pulling in the latest changes soon, and seeing if my CI completes it's build with that fix. How should I go about getting permission to push my commit with the updated CI? And I assume the one that uses the version of OpenImageIO that doesn't require boost, is the commit I should be pushing.", "Sorry for the wait on this. After getting the release version of the build setup and working, I moved onto the debug version but ran into some issues which came to a head at pybind11's debug build. This issue gave me a lot of trouble, and I meant to come back to it eventually for a better look later but got caught up in other work. \n\nAnyway I made mention of the issue in the commit I made on my own fork of the repo, but essentially a repeating error of \"IMPORTED_LOCATION not set for important target\" is given for a variety of targets such as: \"pybind11::module\", \"pybind11::thin_lto\", \"pybind11::windows_extras\", \"pybind11::pybind11\", etc.\n\nI believe the reason for this error may be resolved by editing the CMake code regarding pybind11, but if that is the solution then that is something I don't feel comfortable editing. Since all of my focus has been within the build_install directory, when I have had the time to work on this issue.\n\nI continued the debug build past pybind11 by removing it from the list of dependencies to build, and the other dependencies were able to build just fine including the final OSL build. There is one additional error regarding glut.h not being copied into the proper folder, but I gave a list of steps to follow regarding copying the file into it's correct folder (in the Readme). That file is needed by Partio, during it's build.\n\nBesides that I updated various versions of the dependencies, added IMath to build_osl.py, and updated the ReadMe for the build with this new information, including what dependencies needed to be installed by the user and which would automatically be installed by running the Release and Debug versions of the build_osl.bat script. Let me know if there's any other information you need, or anything regarding procedure In need to do for the commit of this issue.\n\nThanks,\nNate" ],

      "description" : "### Proposal summary\n\nWe like to extend the existing evaluation metrics to include a new metric called \"Trajectory Accuracy\". Esentially we are evaluating ReAct style agents by reasoning about the sequence of actions taken and their outcomes. Based on the paper “ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models” https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629. You can also see the Langchain implementation here:\n- https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/evaluation/langchain.evaluation.agents.trajectory_eval_chain.TrajectoryEvalChain.html\n- https://github.com/langchain-ai/agentevals/tree/main/python/agentevals/trajectory\n\nExample of an existing judge metric (Hallucination) is defined here:\n- Docs: https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/evaluation/metrics/hallucination\n- Docs Code: https://github.com/comet-ml/opik/blob/main/apps/opik-documentation/documentation/fern/docs/evaluation/metrics/hallucination.mdx\n- Python SDK: https://github.com/comet-ml/opik/tree/main/sdks/python/src/opik/evaluation/metrics/llm_judges/hallucination\n- Python Examples: https://github.com/comet-ml/opik/blob/main/sdks/python/examples/metrics.py\n- Frontend: https://github.com/comet-ml/opik/blob/main/apps/opik-frontend/src/constants/llm.ts\n\nIdeally this is implemented as an LLM-as-a-judge. Expectation is the new judge is added to the frontend for using LLM-as-a-judge from the UI (Online Evaluation tab) as well as in the Python SDK. The appropriate docs needs to be updated and a video attached of the metric working.\n\nReturn should be float (0-1), and if its using LLM as a eval then should also contain a \"reason/explanation\"\n\n### Motivation\n\nI would like to see more robust set of metrics and evaluations based on recent research.",

It clearly states that EOS and image deprecation date for tis image is May 2025. \n\nI suspect the error can be easily fixed by updating [this line](https://github.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-apps/blob/55d09c01704909e1142fd14e2a91d5525872efd0/server_manager/www/gcp_account.ts#L275), but I'm not sure what image is to be used (otherwise I could try to open a PR). \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. open Outline Manager\n2. connect to GCP account\n3. create a project using \"ADD SERVER\" tab\n4. create server using on of the locations (same behaviour is observed for multiple server locations)\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\nSuccessfully completed addition of new server as it was before.\n\n### What actually happened?\n\nI've tried to create a new GCP server using the respective option in \"ADD SERVER\" tab. \n\n### Outline Version\n\n1.17.2\n\n### What operation system are you using?\n\nmacOS\n\n### Operating System Version\n\nSonoma 14.6.1\n\n### Screenshots and Videos\n\n_No response_",

This is great.\n\nI've noticed in my own experimentation, plus reviewing these PRs, that my biggest concern is that we just don't have enough tests. A lot of code is untouched by the test suite. Codecov is not the perfect tool here, because it has a little trouble parsing fypp -> f90, so it marks some lines as not covered that are actually covered. Still, there are things like the output files, the probes, data transfer between simulation -> post_process, and so on. \n\nThe code is not so hard to refactor, but there are some areas that are concerning. I suspect that #914 is a side effect of me or someone else's PR (I could be wrong). This case simply wasn't tested in CI appropriately.\n\nThere is a tango required to get decent tests without overfitting to specific computers or spending 10 hours in CI running (plus another 10 hours queuing in some cases). But I would rather have good tests so we can more confidently refactor and add features than be cavalier about merging quite important changes into the code. \n\nAn example is #907 from @XZTian64 or #855 (and similar) from @Malmahrouqi3 and #901 from me. I'm not fully confident that nothing will go wrong in merging these, despite the tests. The ones that involve writing probes or post_process are most concerning at the moment, I think." ],

This causes:\n\n- Confusing validation errors\n- Two conflicting rollout sources\n- A broken mental model\n\n---\n\n### Proposed Fix (shown in the prototype)\n\n1. User adds a scheduled rollout via the **Schedule** tab.\n2. Only after selecting a date and time, the release condition fields appear (progressive disclosure).\n3. The **Overview** tab updates to clearly show the scheduled rollout date and percentage.\n\nThis makes the state clear, avoids user errors, and reinforces the schedule as the single source of truth.\n\nLet me know your thoughts! Happy to refine it!", "I like it! However, we don't allow editing a schedule. So after you click \"Schedule\", we should probably reset the state of the form so a person can schedule their next change should they so choose. Keeping the rollout field around is confusing." ],

      "description" : "Add \"Rename\" Button for Preset Management with Popup Modal\r\n\r\n**Description:**\r\nWe need to add a \"Rename\" button between the ComboBox (for selecting presets) and the \"Delete\" button. When clicked, this button should open a popup modal asking the user to enter a new name for the selected preset. Upon confirming, the preset's name should be updated in the object (`presets.name`) and the associated file. The previous file with the old name should be deleted.\r\n\r\n**Tasks:**\r\n\r\n1. **Add the \"Rename\" button:**\r\n   - Place the \"Rename\" button between the ComboBox (preset selector) and the \"Delete\" button.\r\n   - Ensure the button is clearly labeled and fits within the existing layout.\r\n\r\n2. **Implement the popup modal:**\r\n   - Create a modal that appears when the \"Rename\" button is clicked.\r\n   - The modal should include:\r\n     - An input field for the new preset name.\r\n     - \"Confirm\" and \"Cancel\" buttons.\r\n   - The \"Confirm\" button should only be enabled if the input field is not empty.\r\n\r\n3. **Handle renaming logic:**\r\n   - Update the `presets.name` property with the new name when the user clicks \"Confirm\".\r\n   - Rename the corresponding preset file to match the new name and delete the old file.\r\n   - Ensure the file renaming is done safely, checking for any name conflicts or invalid characters.\r\n\r\n4. **Update the ComboBox selection and display:**\r\n   - Refresh the ComboBox options to reflect the updated preset name.\r\n   - Maintain the current selection in the ComboBox with the new name after renaming.\r\n\r\n5. **Test the renaming functionality:**\r\n   - Verify that the \"Rename\" button opens the modal correctly.\r\n   - Test renaming with various inputs (valid, invalid, empty, conflicting names).\r\n   - Confirm that the file is renamed correctly and the old file is deleted.\r\n   - Ensure the ComboBox updates to reflect the new name without issues.\r\n\r\n6. **Update documentation:**\r\n   - Document the new \"Rename\" functionality.\r\n   - Update any relevant sections of the user guide to explain how to rename presets.\r\n\r\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\r\n- The \"Rename\" button appears between the ComboBox and \"Delete\" button and functions as intended.\r\n- The popup modal asks the user for a new name, and the \"Confirm\" button only works when a valid name is provided.\r\n- The preset's name is updated both in the object (`presets.name`) and the corresponding file.\r\n- The previous file is deleted after renaming.\r\n- The ComboBox correctly displays the updated preset name.\r\n- Documentation is updated to reflect the new feature.\r\n\r\n**Additional Context:**\r\n- The project uses ImGui, and the modal should integrate seamlessly with the existing UI.\r\n- Ensure that renaming presets does not interfere with other functionalities like saving, loading, or deleting presets.",

      "description" : "### \uD83D\uDE80 The feature, motivation and pitch\n\nI want to add a unit test for AOTI testing if user_managed weights works with load_state_dict.\n\nIt can follow a similar test https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/test/inductor/test_aot_inductor.py#L5733-L5835, but the new test is supposed to be simpler. \n\nUser managed is the last bool passed into update_constant_buffer:\nhttps://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/d5d14ee823e70224a154884a5c2912643d648094/torch/_C/_aoti.pyi#L28\n\n# Motivation:\n\nAOTI will take in an eager (i.e. un-compiled)model and spit out a AOTI Model that is compiled. update_constant_buffer is an api to update the weights of such model. If we set user_managed=True, the new weights that we are passing in should just point to the tensors (i.e. no copy is done). So ideally, if we update the tensors we passed it, the changes should reflect on the AOTI model. This is already tested in test_update_user_managed_buffer.\n\nWhat I want to see tested is if we:\n1. pass in the model weights to AOTI model with user managed\n2. Update the eager model weights with load_state_dict\n3. Check if the update is reflected on the AOTI model.\n\n### Alternatives\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\ncc @chauhang @penguinwu @avikchaudhuri @gmagogsfm @zhxchen17 @tugsbayasgalan @angelayi @suo @ydwu4 @desertfire @chenyang78 @yushangdi @benjaminglass1",

Is it still relevant or not?", "From what I can tell, we could introduce a new configuration option to truncate large data fields within the ValueObject property. A good place to implement this might be here:\n\uD83D\uDC49 https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/blob/master/pkg/apis/application/v1alpha1/values.go#L34.\n\nIf the serialized data at this point (https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/blob/master/pkg/apis/application/v1alpha1/values.go#L20) is too large, we could truncate it accordingly.\n\nAdditionally, I'm considering introducing levels of truncation for deeply nested JSON structures. For this, we could add a --log-json-max-depth configuration flag. For example, if --log-json-max-depth=2, everything deeper than 2 levels would be replaced with a placeholder like \"...(truncated)\".\n\nGiven the following example:\n```\n{\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"name\": \"app\",\n    \"labels\": {\n      \"env\": \"prod\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"spec\": {\n    \"containers\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"nginx\",\n        \"resources\": {\n          \"limits\": {\n            \"cpu\": \"500m\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\nWith --log-json-max-depth=2, it would become:\n```\n{\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"name\": \"app\",\n    \"labels\": \"...(truncated)\"\n  },\n  \"spec\": {\n    \"containers\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"nginx\",\n        \"resources\": \"...(truncated)\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\nThis would allow users to control how much detail they want to include in logs, preventing overly verbose output while retaining useful context.

To improve maintainability and keep styles organized, we should move these styles into the appropriate `.scss` file and remove the inline style block from the HTML.\n\nThis is a fast follow from this [PR](https://github.com/Techtonica/techtonica.org/pull/615#pullrequestreview-2711350658)\n\n# Tasks:\n\n- [ ] Move all `<style> `block content from `templates/app-form-details.html` into the SCSS file\n- [ ] Remove the entire `<style>` block from the HTML file once verified\n- [ ] Extract shared styles across application forms into reusable mixins or partials\n- [ ] Test to make sure no styles have changed\n- [ ] Move form styles to a new partial `_form.scss` file\n\nBe sure to follow the [CSS SCSS Styling Instructions Wiki](https://github.com/Techtonica/techtonica.org/wiki/CSS-SCSS-Styling-Instructions-Wiki) to adequately make these changes.\n\n# Out of Scope:\n- Refactoring javascript to its own file\n- Refactoring styles of other forms\n- Style changes or updates - all styles should be visually unchanged",

I was able to figure out that, this component is the one rendering the button  \"⋮\" https://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/apps/studio/components/interfaces/Auth/Users/UserDropdown.tsx\r\n\r\n2. While doing going through the code base, I was able to detect the code that is rendering the UserDropdown.tsx \r\nhttps://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/apps/studio/components/interfaces/Auth/Users/UsersListItem.tsx \r\n\r\nI noticed it is possible to check if the user is already confirmed from this line \r\nhttps://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/apps/studio/components/interfaces/Auth/Users/UsersListItem.tsx#L29\r\n\r\nI think I can either passed the isUserConfirmed to the UserDropdown.tsx component or create another derive state  inside the UserDropdown.tsx as it is derived from UsersListItem.tsx and then render the text inside https://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/apps/studio/components/interfaces/Auth/Users/UserDropdown.tsx#L160 using the state. \r\n\r\n3. For the two bonuses. I think, I was able to locate the part that renders them\r\nhttps://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/apps/studio/components/interfaces/Auth/AuthTemplatesValidation.tsx \r\n\r\nIf I get the first bonus part, this line https://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/apps/studio/components/interfaces/Auth/AuthTemplatesValidation.tsx#L151 should be  *Password Recovery*\r\n\r\nFor the second bonus, I think using the \"Magic Link\" format is okay. \r\n\r\nThough, I was able to build the project on my local system. I need a little guidance on recognising on how I can get to this pages.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n", "Hi @Hallidayo, I am looking for my open source contribution.\r\nCan I pick this issue?

", "Hi @Unique-Usman - Thank you for taking a look into this one.\r\n\r\nYep thats the correct component to use. I think its good to just have the one item displayed so if the user is awaiting an invite the button should be:\r\n\r\n`Send Invite Link`\r\n\r\nIf the user is confirmed then the default button should be displayed:\r\n\r\n`Send Magic Link`\r\n\r\nFor the headings in the Email Templates that is the correct file. Its the `title` key in each object that needs to be checked. Its probably best to uppercase the start of each word so `Invite user` to `Invite User`.\r\n\r\nAre you able to view the Email Templates locally? ", "@Hallidayo, thanks for your reply. I was unable to view the Email Template Locally, I could not figure out the link. \r\n\r\nIs it *Send Invite Link* or *Confirm SignUp Link*. \r\nAlso the user can be checked if already confirmed through  `const isUserConfirmed = user.email_confirmed_at || user.phone_confirmed_at`, in this scenerio, we just havae to check for the `user.email_confirmed_at` ?\r\n", "@Unique-Usman - If you go to http://localhost:8082/project/default/auth/templates you should then get the templates showing for you locally.\r\n\r\nSorry yes it should be Confirm Sign Up Link.\r\n\r\nYeah you should be able to use the `isUserConfirmed` constant to switch between the two items.\r\n\r\nFeel free to reach out if you need anything!", "@Hallidayo, I have a first PR for the resolvement of the issues https://github.com/supabase/supabase/pull/27759, kindly check thank you.

A feature like this would allow us to efficiently send a warning to one or more players, which would then justify us to take actions with more confidence and with a longer punishment time.\n\nWith the current solutions, there's no effective way of communicating with the player in a way that proves, without denial, that we are authenticated as a moderator. Currently, players may ignore chat messages or even completely disable the chat, which would make any form of communication hopeless. A form of communication like this would be important before taking more aggressive actions, such as kicking or banning.\n\nA feature like this would allow us to scare most players who aren't fully aware of the consequences. Allowing us to send a message to a group of players, regardless of whether they are blocking or not, without consequences. This can be applied in chaotic cases that casual methods of moderation wouldn't be feasible, such as in Linear and Multeasymap servers.",

Out of convenience, people began plucking out values and using them in non-dataviz use cases.\n\nThis topic will inevitably lead toward _\"Do we still need the palettes then?\"_\n- I would hash that out with the data viz experts.\n- Note that these palettes are also exposed to users when building visualizations so, in that regard, we may need to keep the component but be more restrictive on its use and guidelines." ],

Why not reformat this to make it more consistent and informative?\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n I'm envisioning a table, listing the same info for each app:\n\n- Name (which links to the app, as currently)\n- Perhaps a small screenshot\n- Brief description of what it does\n- Platform(s) supported\n\nAlso, we currently have one page for Briefcase and one for Toga; they have some apps in common and some unique, and there's no mechanism to sync these. Considering how often people ask about examples, I think it might make more sense to put one combined page on the main site, and potentially link to it from both docs. It would also then make sense, I imagine, to add a column for \"BeeWare component(s) used\". \n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nWe could still maintain separate pages, but I'm not sure if there's a good way to make sure they stay in sync with each other. It's also not clear, currently, from just looking at one, which of the apps also use the other.\n\nIf we do keep the individual pages, it seems redundant to mention that each app uses the tech in question.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

I disabled Windows search indexing on my Nextcloud directory because windows kept on downloading files I wanted to only keep online every time I searched for something in the parent folder.\n\nThe search function in the Nextcloud tray menu is able to find the desired sub folder, but clicking the folder only opens the containing folder and not the folder itself. This is useless to me because, as said, there are a lot of different folders and the folder names are too similar.\n\nIt looks like Nextcloud just opens the containing folder for folders or files. It would be nice if there was at least a context open to allow opening folder or files.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nOpen folder or file by default and have open containing folder the context menu option, but that risks messing with other people's workflow since open containing folder is the current behavior.",

However, the page doesn't do anything outside of stopping the spinner to show the request finished. No error message is shown to direct me to how to fix the issue.\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n1. Take an offer\n2. Send the collateral\n3. Attempt to submit an invoice with a small PPM to force failure\n4. Notice no message comes up\n5. Check the dev console and look at the failed call in the Network tab.\n6. Cry a little\n\n**Expected behavior**\nI expected that a failure would show a toast or something to tell me how to fix the problem. The message returned from the API has the information I would need. It just should be surfaced in the UI so I don't have to go looking through the Network tab to find the solution.\n\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\n - OS: PopOS\n - Browser: Tor Browser\n - Version: 14.5.4\n",

However, if I set up a rule to append to a note, no space is added between the note and added text. I'm ok with either behavior, but would prefer it to be consistent.\n\n### How can we reproduce the issue?\n\nSelect a transaction, bulk edit note, prepend or append, type anything in. You will notice a space is placed in between the old and new text.\n\nCreate a rule (or just use the rule editor to bulk edit) that prepends or appends to a note, run it, you'll see that no space is added.\n\n### Where are you hosting Actual?\n\nDocker\n\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\n\nChrome, Firefox\n\n### Operating System\n\nWindows 11",

      "comments" : [ "DataFlex uses a lot of different file extensions, some of which will likely have conflicts. Modern DataFlex uses a common workspace structure, such as `AppSrc/cMyClass.pkg`. Searching for [NOT is:fork path:Appsrc/**.pkg](https://github.com/search?type=code&q=NOT+is%3Afork+path%3AAppsrc%2F**.pkg\n) narrows it down to effectively DataFlex source code files and provides 900+ results. Many of the other file extensions are nowhere near that many, so it won't meet the minimum usage requirements.\n\nGiven that there are so many file extensions in use, maybe a better initial approach could be to add support for DataFlex without specifying `extensions` or `filenames` to avoid conflicts. And DataFlex source repositories can use `.gitattributes` overrides for the relevant extensions instead. Obviously not ideal, but it would at least provide recognition for the DataFlex language, and that's a great starting point.\n\nI see there is some precedence for languages without specifying file extensions, such as for Elvish transcripts from PR #6302, which is mainly used inside markdown files. @lildude and @NilsSve, I can help and put up a PR for adding the DataFlex language without specifying any file extensions, would that work?\n", "Hi Sonny,\n\nIf you are asking me, yes, that would help! The current repositories at @NilsSve are using .gitattributes exactly as suggested.", "> I see there is some precedence for languages without specifying file extensions, such as for Elvish transcripts from PR [#6302](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/pull/6302), which is mainly used inside markdown files. [@lildude](https://github.com/lildude) and [@NilsSve](https://github.com/NilsSve), I can help and put up a PR for adding the DataFlex language without specifying any file extensions, would that work?\n\nIt would \"work\" but it won't be accepted. The Elvish exception is because there isn't a common extension as it's predominantly used in a markdown files. This is not the case with DataFlex.\n\nI know nothing about DataFlex but wikipedia says \"DataFlex is an object-oriented high-level programming language and a fourth generation visual tool for developing Windows, web and mobile software applications on one framework-based platform.\"\n\nWe do not add support for frameworks, hence we support Ruby, but not Rails, so the right thing to do is concentrate on only the language files. I'd expect the language to have a common extension and structure that can be identified.  This should be what is added first, assuming usage meets requirements, and then users can use the overrides to classify the other extensions if they want.\n\nIf the language predominantly uses a generic extension like `.pkg` (poor design decision IMO), this can be added the `generic.yml` file and a heuristic will be used to identify the language, but be warned: this heuristic _must_ be very accurate to only identify DataFlex files and must be linear and performant. It's better for this regex to under identify DataFlex files than misidentify other languages.", "> It would \"work\" but it won't be accepted. The Elvish exception is because there isn't a common extension as it's predominantly used in a markdown files. This is not the case with DataFlex.\n\nI see. That makes sense. DataFlex is an old language that's been around in its current object-oriented form for 20+ years. Its use is mainly for database business applications, for Windows and web apps. It unfortunately doesn't have a single dedicated file extension, and the convention is to use one of a set of extensions representing the main purpose of the specific DataFlex source file. Such as `.vw` for a view, and other extensions for database business logic etc. The `.pkg` extension is typically used for reusable classes, which is why it's the predominant extension seen on GitHub.\n\n> If the language predominantly uses a generic extension like .pkg (poor design decision IMO), this can be added the generic.yml file and a heuristic will be used to identify the language, but be warned: this heuristic must be very accurate to only identify DataFlex files and must be linear and performant. It's better for this regex to under identify DataFlex files than misidentify other languages.\n\nThat sounds like a great idea, thanks! I will pursue this strategy for the `.pkg` file extension since it's the most commonly used extension. I'll follow the instructions and add it to `generic.yml` with heuristics and tests. Thanks again!", "And may I add that DataFlex has two frameworks. One for Windows and one for the Web, with overlaps between them for datadictionaries for consistent database behaviour.\n\nHowever, the frameworks are not optionals/add-ons like in many other languages. Instead they are an integrated part of the DataFlex language. And they are written in the DataFlex language.\n\nSure, a web-based DataFlex application also uses javascript libraries and many other parts needed for a modern webapp, but those files are not part of the frameworks. The build in frameworks are more guided towards how to develop applications more easy, fluently and make the code more robust and easier to follow." ],

      "description" : "# \uD83C\uDFAF Triple-Feature Mission – UX Enhancements\n\nLet’s tackle **three small but impactful user experience improvements** in one go! These enhancements aim to improve how citizens interact with the issue reporting and tracking flow.\n\n---\n\n## 1. \uD83D\uDCCB Copy Issue Link Button\n\n### Problem\nThere’s currently no easy way to share a direct link to a specific issue.\n\n### Solution\n- Add a **copy-to-clipboard** button (copy icon) near each issue title.\n- Clicking it should copy the full permalink of the issue (e.g., `https://civix.app/issues/42`) to the user’s clipboard.\n- Display a **toast notification** confirming the action.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```jsx\n<IssueHeader>\n  <h2>{issue.title}</h2>\n  <CopyLinkButton issueId={issue.id} />\n</IssueHeader>\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2. \uD83C\uDF89 Submission Confirmation\n\n### Problem\nAfter reporting an issue, users aren’t clearly informed about success or what to do next.\n\n### Solution\n- Show a **modal popup** confirming successful submission.\n- Include the **new issue ID** (e.g., Issue #42).\n- Offer two clear next steps:\n  - ✅ View the reported issue\n  - ➕ Report another issue\n\n### Mock Layout\n\n```\n+-----------------------------+\n|  \uD83C\uDF89 Thank You!             |\n|  ✓ Issue #42 reported!     |\n|                             |\n|  [ View Issue ] [ Report Another ] |\n+-----------------------------+\n```\n\n---\n\n## 3. \uD83D\uDD22 Smart Character Counters\n\n### Problem\nUsers can’t see how many characters they’ve typed or how close they are to a limit.\n\n### Solution\n- Add **live character counters** to all long-text input fields (e.g., description).\n- Use color indicators:\n  - \uD83D\uDFE2 Normal (< 80%): gray text (`text-gray-500`)\n  - \uD83D\uDFE0 Near Limit (≥ 80%): orange text (`text-orange-500`)\n  - \uD83D\uDD34 Over Limit: red text (`text-red-600`)\n- Set configurable limits (e.g., 500 characters).\n\n### Example UI States\n\n| State       | Color         | Example        |\n|-------------|---------------|----------------|\n| Normal      | Gray          | `45 / 500`     |\n| Near Limit  | Orange        | `410 / 500`    |\n| Over Limit  | Red           | `502 / 500`    |\n\n---\n\n## \uD83E\uDDEA Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] All features work correctly in **both Light and Dark modes**\n- [ ] Fully **mobile-responsive**\n- [ ] No regressions or broken functionality\n- [ ] (Optional) Components added to **Storybook** if applicable\n- [ ] Code includes clear, maintainable structure with reusable components\n\n---\n\n## \uD83E\uDDF0 Tech Notes\n\n- Copy button may use [`navigator.clipboard.writeText()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clipboard/writeText)\n- Toasts can use an existing toast component or [React Hot Toast](https://react-hot-toast.com/)\n- Character counter can be a custom hook or inline logic for now\n\n---\n\n## \uD83D\uDCCC Related Areas\n\n- `IssueDetail.jsx`\n- `NewIssueForm.jsx`\n- `components/ui/Toast.jsx`\n- `components/ui/Modal.jsx`\n- `components/CharacterCounter.jsx` (to be created)\n\n---\n\n**Let’s ship these delightfully helpful improvements \uD83D\uDE80**\n",

Usually this occurs when an app is buggy and only sends the leaf certificate without its chain, and explicitly trusting the leaf's issuing intermediate CA seems to fix the problem for them. Crucially, when that intermediate is then rotated their app will break.\r\n\r\nWe could add a toggle, defaulting to false, such as `allowIntermediateCertificates`. If false, it would parse every certificate and ensure that it's self-signed. There might be other ways of achieving the same goal.\r\n\r\nHaving this in from the start could prevent so many misconfigurations by unsuspecting cluster admins.\r\n\r\n(Complication: If we added a list of publicly trusted certs it'd probably need to default to allowing intermediates in that list by default - but we could definitely default to disallowing intermediates everywhere else)",

Crucially, when that intermediate is then rotated their app will break.\r\n\r\nWe could add a toggle, defaulting to false, such as `allowIntermediateCertificates`.

      "description" : "<!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->\n<!--- If you believe the issue may have security implications, please report it as a vulnerability -->\n<!--- Report a vulnerability: https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/security -->\n\nWe are currently re-working our network policies by introducing GlobalNetworkSets. We have labeled each network set with something like `networking.our.internal.stuff/networkset: <name>` to be able to select a single network set in our network policies. We are concerned that someone accidentally adds the same label to a pod or another resource and thus undermines our network policies.\n\n## Expected Behavior\n<!--- If you're describing a bug, tell us what should happen -->\n<!--- If you're suggesting a change/improvement, tell us how it should work -->\n\nIt would be cool if something similar to `projectcalico.org/orchestrator` exists that lets us specify the resource type we want to select. \n\n## Current Behavior\n<!--- If describing a bug, tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->\n<!--- If suggesting a change/improvement, explain the difference from current behavior -->\n\nWe can use `global()` to select across all global resources, but cannot limit this to just GlobalNetworkSets. We can use an external policy agent, like OPA or kyverno, to disallow setting our networkset labels on resources that are not network sets but this requires an additional system to be deployed.\n\n## Possible Solution\n<!--- Not obligatory, but suggest a fix/reason for the bug, -->\n<!--- or ideas how to implement the addition or change -->\n\nCalico could automatically add a new label, e.g. `projectcalico.org/kind` to each calico resource so that we can select resources by kind and their labels within the same selector. In our case, we could write a selector like `networking.our.internal.stuff/networkset == \"some-name\" && projectcalico.org/kind == \"GlobalNetworkSet\"`\n\nAnother solution would be something like a `kind(GlobalNetworkSet)` expression that does the same, but does not require an extra label.\n\n## Context\n<!--- How has this issue affected you? What are you trying to accomplish? -->\n<!--- Providing context helps us come up with a solution that is most useful in the real world -->\n\nWe want to be as strict as possible in our network policies and close any potential loophole that might exist in our setup.\n",

Their labels are not. It is possible to add the same label to two different network sets potentially allowing much more than expected. Something like `kind(GlobalNetworkSet) && name(Something)` as an expression would perfectly express what we want without allowing any potential misconfiguration.\n\nAgain, we can work around this using additional tooling (VAP/OPA/Kyverno) that verifies that the value of our `networking.our.internal.stuff/networkset` label exactly matches the name of a global network set, but built-in support for more precision when declaring network policies would be really nice!", "Hey guys,\n\nI'd love to try and work on this one. Do you have a general advice where I should start with this?", "Thanks @ivnhk ! \n\nI'd start by familiarizing yourself with how to build and run Calico and its tests. There's a general contribution guide here: https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md (although I'll admit, it might be a tad out of date...)\n\nYou might also want to poke around to see how the (very similar) `orchestrator` label is handled for kubernetes pods. Here's a hint: https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/blob/f3da524b7c6e4cfdf9874b2cddd0233213a1d8f3/libcalico-go/lib/backend/k8s/conversion/workload_endpoint_default.go#L163\n\nWe convert pods into an internal type called \"WorkloadEndpoint\" and when we do, we force a label to be set on it for selection. \n\nFor NetworkSets, you could probably do something similar - or even better since it's an API that we control, you could also add it to the defaulting and validation code for that API - here are some hints on that part:\n\n- https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/blob/master/libcalico-go/lib/clientv3/networkset.go\n- https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/blob/f3da524b7c6e4cfdf9874b2cddd0233213a1d8f3/libcalico-go/lib/validator/v3/validator.go#L269-L270 " ],

      "description" : "## Bug Report\n\nPlease answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\n\n### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)\n\n1.  Open https://www.kcl-lang.io/ on a mobile device (or resize your browser window to a mobile viewport width).\n2.  Scroll down to the \"Subscribe to Newsletter\" section.\n\n### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)\n\nThe email input field and the \"SUBSCRIBE\" button should ideally be horizontally aligned, or at least optimized for a tidier and more integrated appearance on mobile screens.\n\n### 3. What did you see instead (Required)\n\nThe email input field and the \"SUBSCRIBE\" button are currently displayed vertically (one above the other), resulting in an untidy and less integrated appearance on mobile devices.\n\n**Screenshots:**\n**Current Mobile Layout:**\n<img width=\"120\" alt=\"Mobile - before\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0a8aba4-28e1-4d38-81b5-b3877e3c110a\" />\n*Description:* Shows the input field and button stacked vertically.\n\n### 4. What is your KCL components version? (Required)\n\nN/A. This issue pertains to the User Interface (UI) of the `kcl-lang.io` website on mobile, not to a KCL component or runtime.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Information\n\nI have a local fix that adjusts the CSS/layout of the subscribe form to align the email input field and the \"SUBSCRIBE\" button horizontally on mobile viewports. This change significantly improves the form's appearance and responsiveness.\n\n**Screenshot of Proposed Layout (Local Fix Example):**\n<img width=\"120\" alt=\"Mobile - after\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab312215-2880-4d00-9fb8-16e539437abd\" />\n*Description:* Shows the input field and button horizontally aligned, demonstrating a cleaner look.\n\nI am ready to open a Pull Request (PR) with the proposed changes if this improvement is a good fit for the project. Please let me know if you would like me to proceed with a PR.\n\nThank you for your consideration.",

As of now, Souvlaki leaves it up to the user to change the URL depending on the platform.\r\n\r\nFor Linux, we follow the MPRIS specification, which actually doesn't say much cover art apart from what's in [here](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/mpris-spec/metadata/#mpris:arturl). It only says that local files should start with `file://` and that it should be an UTF-8 string, which is enforced by Rust. Maybe you can look in the source code of desktop managers such as GNOME or KDE, since these read the field to display it on their media player controls.\r\n\r\nFor Windows, we use the _SystemMediaTransportControlsDisplayUpdater_, which has [a thumbnail property](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.media.systemmediatransportcontrolsdisplayupdater.thumbnail?view=winrt-22621#windows-media-systemmediatransportcontrolsdisplayupdater-thumbnail). It accepts multiple formats, but we choose to create it using an URI. If setting an URL starting with `file://`, the file is automatically loaded by souvlaki.\r\n\r\nFor MacOS, you can look into [these lines](https://github.com/Sinono3/souvlaki/blob/384539fe83e8bf5c966192ba28e9405e3253619b/src/platform/macos/mod.rs#L131-L137) of the implementation. These lines refer to creating an [MPMediaItemArtwork](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mediaplayer/mpmediaitemartwork) object.\r\n\r\nI hope this is of use to you.

      "description" : "## Background\nThe PID class is a base implementation for lots of controllers. Therefore, we should thrive for full test coverage\n\nHaving a look at the [coverage report](https://app.codecov.io/gh/ros-controls/control_toolbox/tree/ros2-master/control_toolbox), we see that some methods have no coverage, e.g., \n\n- `void PidROS::reset()`\n- `void PidROS::reset(bool save_i_term)`\n- `double PidROS::compute_command(double error, double error_dot, const rclcpp::Duration & dt)`\n- `void PidROS::set_current_cmd(double cmd) { pid_.set_current_cmd(cmd); }`\n- `double PidROS::get_current_cmd() { return pid_.get_current_cmd(); }`\n- `void PidROS::print_values()`\n\nand in general, we have little coverage in testing the input validations.\n\nImprove that by additional tests/test-cases.\n\n## Instructions\nHi, this is a `good-first-issue` issue. This means we've worked to make it more legible to people who either **haven't contributed to our codebase before, or even folks who haven't contributed to open source before**.\n\nWe're interested in helping you take the first step, and can answer questions and help you out along the way. Note that we're especially interested in contributions from underrepresented groups!\n\nWe know that creating a pull request is the biggest barrier for new contributors. This issue is for you \uD83D\uDC9D\n\nIf you have contributed before, **consider leaving this PR for someone new**, and looking through our general [bug](https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_control/labels/bug) issues. Thanks!\n\n### \uD83E\uDD14 What you will need to know.\n\nNothing. This issue is meant to welcome you to Open Source :) We are happy to walk you through the process.\n\n### \uD83D\uDCCB Step by Step\n\n- [ ] \uD83D\uDE4B **Claim this issue**: Comment below. If someone else has claimed it, ask if they've opened a pull request already and if they're stuck -- maybe you can help them solve a problem or move it along!\n\n- [ ] \uD83D\uDDC4️ **Create a local workspace** for making your changes and testing [following these instructions](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Tutorials/Workspace/Creating-A-Workspace.html), for Step 3 use \"Download Source Code\" section with [these instructions](https://control.ros.org/master/doc/getting_started/getting_started.html#building-from-source).\n\n- [ ] \uD83C\uDF74 **Fork the repository** using the handy button at the top of the repository page and **clone** it into `~/ws_ros2_control/src/ros-controls/ros2_control`, [here is a guide that you can follow](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) (You will have to remove or empty the existing `ros2_control` folder before cloning your own fork)\n\n- [ ] **Checkout a new branch** using `git checkout -b <branch_name>`\n\n- [ ] \uD83E\uDD16 **Apply `pre-commit`** auto formatting, by running `pip3 install pre-commit` and running `pre-commit install` in the ros2_control repo.\n\n- [ ] \uD83D\uDCBE **Commit and Push** your changes\n\n- [ ] \uD83D\uDD00 **Start a Pull Request** to request to merge your code into `master`. There are two ways that you can start a pull request:\n1. If you are not familiar with GitHub or how to create a pull request, [here is a guide you can follow](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) on how GitHub works.\n\n- [ ] \uD83C\uDFC1 **Done** Ask in comments for a review :)\n\n### Is someone else already working on this?\n\n\uD83D\uDD17- We encourage contributors to link to the original issue in their pull request so all users can easily see if someone's already started on it.\n\n\uD83D\uDC65- **If someone seems stuck, offer them some help!**\n\n### \uD83E\uDD14❓ Questions?\n\nDon’t hesitate to ask questions or to get help if you feel like you are getting stuck. For example leave a comment below!\nFurthermore, you find helpful resources here:\n* [ROS2 Control Contribution Guide](https://control.ros.org/master/doc/contributing/contributing.html)\n* [ROS2 Tutorials](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Tutorials.html)\n* [Robotics Stack Exchange](https://robotics.stackexchange.com)\n\n**Good luck with your first issue!**\n",

That would take you to major.minor release section of the download page. That would require those sections' URLs to be long-term stable URLs. If not, alternative URLs are needed.\r\n\r\n@kythant @gabbybilka @MikeHillberg are those URLs long-term stable? If not is there a long-term stable alternative? If not could we make that?", "This issue can be reproduced using unpackaged sample apps from the [WindowsAppSDK-Samples](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK-Samples/tree/release/experimental/Samples/Unpackaged) repository.\n\uD83D\uDEE0️ Resolution Guidance\nThe error dialog currently directs users to the latest Windows App SDK downloads page, rather than the specific version required by the application, which can lead to confusion—especially when older versions are hosted separately.\n✅ Expected Behavior\nEnsure the error dialog redirects users to atleast the correct major/minor version of the required installer.\n\uD83D\uDD17 Linking Strategy\n\t• Collaborate with the Docs team to determine whether redirection links can be hosted entirely on the docs site. For example, link to version 1.7 could initially point to the main downloads page and later redirect to the archive page. Or, whether we need to create stable links for each version\n\uD83E\uDDE9 Code Changes\n\t• Confirm that the correct major and minor version numbers are accessible—or can be made accessible—in code at the point where the error dialog is invoked (see [Initialize_OnError_ShowUI](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK/blob/5ce1f09f8ed314dd647c12be1d910ef894645168/dev/Deployment/DeploymentManager.cpp#L661) and [MddBootstrapInitialize_ShowUI_OnNoMatch](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK/blob/5ce1f09f8ed314dd647c12be1d910ef894645168/dev/WindowsAppRuntime_BootstrapDLL/MddBootstrap.cpp#L1153))\n\t• Construct a version-specific URL using the major and minor version numbers and pass it to the ShellExecute call.\n\uD83D\uDD2E Future-Proofing\n\t• Consider fallback behavior if a version-specific link is unavailable (low priority)." ],

We think that KubeStellar works in more configurations, and they should be tested.\r\n\r\n- Things other than `kind` providing Kubernetes clusters.\r\n- The WDS and/or ITS role played by the hosting cluster.\r\n- The WDS and/or ITS role played by some other pre-existing cluster.\r\n- One new ControlPlane playing both ITS and WDS roles.\r\n\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nDo something. Without expanding the gating CI tests too much (note: I am not asserting exactly how much is too much).\n\n### Want to contribute?\n\n- [ ] I would like to work on this issue.\n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_",

link\n\nhttps://biomejs.dev/playground/?code=aQBtAHAAbwByAHQAIAB0AHkAcABlACAAewB9ACAAZgByAG8AbQAgACcAQABtAHUAaQAvAHgALQBkAGEAdABhAC0AZwByAGkAZAAvAHQAaABlAG0AZQBBAHUAZwBtAGUAbgB0AGEAdABpAG8AbgAnADsA\n\n### Expected result\n\nFor certain libraries like MUI, we have imports purely for type augmentation like this:\n\n```ts\nimport type {} from '@mui/lab/themeAugmentation';\n```\n\nWe use `import type {}` so that it will only utilize the type information and nothing else during bundling.\n\nIn Biome v1 there was no error, but Biome v2 triggers an error for `lint/correctness/noUnusedImports` and the fixer actually removes the statement which causes other issues. \n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow Biome's Code of Conduct",

I'm so excited to apply my skills and learn a lot! \uD83D\uDE0A", "Could I take on this issue?", "Hi, I'm Josue Soto from the Dojo Coding community, graduate software engineer, I have 3 years of experience working in databases and IT industry.\n\n**How I plan to solve it:**\n\n- Analyze the database schema and all the relationships.\n- Fix naming discrepancy between owner_id and kinder_id.\n- Update all instances in the database.\n- Update all related documentation to reflect the correct nomenclature conventions.\n- Test the tables and verify that everything works correctly.\n\n", "May I take this issue on?", "Hi, I'd like to take this issue. I have experience handling schema consistency tasks and ensuring naming conventions are properly updated across database, code, and documentation. I’ll make sure all instances are corrected carefully to avoid any confusion or future bugs. Let me know if you'd like me to start with a quick PR!", "I've already handled some tasks in #Supabase in this project. I'm confident I can deliver this on time. Let me handle it.\n\nHave push access on a new branch, ready for signed commits and all other best practices. ", "Hi team,\n\nI'd like to work on Issue #448 regarding the renaming of `owner_id` to `kinder_id` to align with KindFi's internal terminology and avoid confusion across the system.\n\nHere’s how I plan to approach it:\n\n### 1. Schema Refactor (Supabase)\n- Identify all instances of `owner_id` across the Supabase schema (tables, relationships, foreign keys).\n- Rename the columns to `kinder_id`, preserving existing constraints.\n- Create a properly versioned SQL migration file using Supabase CLI and place it under `services/supabase/migrations/`.\n- Validate database consistency after the rename through Supabase CLI and dashboard tools.\n\n### 2. Backend Adjustments (`services/supabase`)\n- Refactor all code references to `owner_id` across query logic, types, and service utilities.\n- Ensure all affected endpoints and mutations behave as expected with the updated schema.\n\n### 3. Frontend Integration (`apps/web`)\n- Update Supabase queries, types, and hooks that reference `owner_id`.\n- Refactor relevant components or forms handling project ownership or user metadata.\n- Run and update any impacted unit tests or mocks accordingly.\n\n### 4. Documentation\n- Update schema diagrams, ERD references, and technical documentation under `docs/` to reflect the updated field naming and align with project terminology.\n\n###  Deliverables\n- Fully working PR with schema + code changes.\n- A Supabase CLI-compatible SQL migration script.\n- Clear changelog and commit breakdown.\n- Optional: Schema diff or notes for internal dev reference.\n\n**ETA:** I estimate 36–48 hours for full implementation, testing, and documentation updates.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to take it! \nHappy to help standardize and improve the DB structure.\n", "# Hi there, @4c1d-V \uD83D\uDC4B You've been assigned this issue.\n\nOne invite is waiting for you in your email.

It is clear that many contributors are not reading the contributing.MD or the documentation update readme. \n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nWe are a welcoming community and we would like to include all regardless of their learning methodology. Some read, others watch. So, we would like a video to welcome contributors and walk them through the basics of contributing to KubeStellar. Once completed, we can create a shortcut url and give it to anyone with a question about making a contribution. This saves everyone time.\n\n### Are you willing to contribute?\n\n- [ ] Yes, I'd like to help implement this feature.\n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_",

Here are the steps to install `sudo` on Windows:\n\n### Installing `sudo` on Windows\n\n1. **Using Chocolatey:**\n   - If you don't have Chocolatey installed, you can install it by following the instructions on the [Chocolatey website](https://chocolatey.org/install).\n   - Once Chocolatey is installed, open a command prompt as an administrator and run:\n     ```bash\n     choco install gsudo\n     ```\n\n2. **Using Scoop:**\n   - If you don't have Scoop installed, you can install it by following the instructions on the [Scoop website](https://scoop.sh/).\n   - Once Scoop is installed, open a command prompt as an administrator and run:\n     ```bash\n     scoop install gsudo\n     ```\n\n3. **Using WinGet:**\n   - If you don't have WinGet installed, you can install it by following the instructions on the [WinGet website](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli).\n   - Once WinGet is installed, open a command prompt as an administrator and run:\n     ```bash\n     winget install gerardog.gsudo\n     ```\n\n## Installation Instructions for KubeFlex\n\n1. **Download the KubeFlex CLI:**\n   - Download the latest KubeFlex CLI binary release for your OS/Architecture from the [release page](https://github.com/kubestellar/kubeflex/releases) and copy it to `/usr/local/bin` or another location in your `$PATH`.\n\n   For example, on Linux amd64:\n   ```bash\n   OS_ARCH=linux_amd64\n   LATEST_RELEASE_URL=\\$(curl -H \"Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json\" https://api.github.com/repos/kubestellar/kubeflex/releases/latest | jq -r '.assets[] | select(.name | contains(\"linux_amd64\")) | .browser_download_url')\n   sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 <(curl -L \\$LATEST_RELEASE_URL) /usr/local/bin/kfle\n\n\n2.**Alternative Installation Command:**\nYou can also use the following command, which will automatically detect the host OS type and architecture:\n\n```\nsudo bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubestellar/kubeflex/main/scripts/install-kubeflex.sh) --ensure-folder /usr/local/bin\n\n```\n", "@Krishna-mishra-26 ty for your help here. This document would probably work best as a PR in the KubeFlex documentation. @pdettori where would you like this to be placed in source?  Once the PR is created, maintainers can make suggestions for changes and updates.

This means that, when executing the `createapp` command, new projects generated with this command use ESLint.\r\n\r\nBut the framework monorepo itself has not yet been migrated to ESLint. This is a technical debt that should be resolved.\r\n\r\n# Guidelines\r\n\r\n- ~If [this PR](https://github.com/FoalTS/foal/pull/1260), which updates the way dependencies are managed in monorepo, has not yet been merged, the new branch should be created from `v4-5-0`. Otherwise, it should be created from `master`. Not only will this facilitate the migration to ESLint, it will also avoid the need for additional work later on to manage ESLint dependencies with the new dependency system.~\r\n- Migration to ESLint should not change the style of the framework code (we don't want thousands of line changes to commit). A lot of work had been done at the time in [this PR](https://github.com/FoalTS/foal/pull/561) to make ESLint rules consistent with TSLint rules. There's probably a lot to be learned from this PR.\r\n- When opening the framework repository with VSCode with the ESLint plugin enabled, VSCode should correctly highlight ESLint errors and correct them when saving (if the plugin is configurer to do so).\r\n\r\n# Notes\r\n\r\n- There *might* be useful information [here](https://typescript-eslint.io/getting-started/typed-linting/monorepos/).\r\n- The files `packages/cli/src/generate/specs/app/.eslintrc.js` and `packages/cli/src/generate/templates/app/.eslintrc.js` used by `foal createapp` to generate new projects may cause problems.",

I'll let you choose what you think is the best solution.\n\nThe ideal solution where we want to go is this:\n- the method used in the monorepo framework should be the same as that used in new projects generated by `foal createapp`,\n- and the linting rules used in the monorepo framework should be the same as those used in new projects generated by `foal createapp`.\n\nIn this way, when we write documentation and copy-paste code from the framework, the examples are always correctly “linted” when users then copy-paste the same code into their projects.\n\n**Note 1:** if we have this ideal solution with the same rules and the `createapp` rules are still the same and there are linting errors that appear from the framework code, then we can fix them all. Go for it \uD83D\uDC4D \n\n**Note 2:** in tests of the directory `acceptance-tests/`, there are pieces of code that are between comments such as `======== DOCUMENTATION BEGIN =======` and `====== DOCUMENTATION END =======`. In this case, this means that these codes are present in the documentation and should be updated as well in the markdowns in case of modification. You can ignore files in `docs/versioned_docs/` and `docs/i18n/`.\n\nThank you so much, for taking care of this.

There are also tools like https://github.com/pejuko/i18n-translators-tools to convert the default Rails yaml into other formats for easier translation. We could also consider future versions of OnDemand using gettext. gettext doesn't use keys like the Rails yaml does, and just takes the full sentence and provides a translation for it. Most TMS support this out of the box, though there may also be examples of TMS projects that work with the Rails yaml formats. Another benefit of the gettext PO format is that its language/framework independent so if at some point we drop Rails or still have a mixture of Rails and other language/framework for apps in OnDemand, or want to translate error strings in Apache and/or NGINX as well, we can handle all of that in an language independent way.\r\n\r\nExamples: http://pootle.translatehouse.org/, http://zanata.org/ (RedHat product with free open source project support)\r\n\r\nSearch for \"open source translation management systems\" to see many options.", "Still thinking about this.

For some operators (e.g., GridSample, Gather, Reshape, Where, etc), shape inference may fail due to incomplete or complex shape logic, even when type inference could succeed. \nThis tight coupling prevents users from recovering type information when shape inference is unsupported or fails. For example, when users attempt to inject cast nodes or quantize nodes and propagate the type information downstream.\n\n\n**Request:**\nPlease consider adding an option to ONNX’s shape inference API to:\n- Run type inference independently of shape inference, so that type information can be propagated even when shape inference fails or is not implemented for an operator.\n- Alternatively, relax the requirement that shape inference must succeed for type inference to run.\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Enables users and downstream tools to recover and validate type information in more models, improving robustness and usability.\n- Reduces manual workarounds (such as manually setting types for affected nodes).\n- Makes ONNX models more portable and easier to analyze, even when shape logic is incomplete.\n\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n1.

Adding SHA-512 support would enable Trivy to fully process these SBOMs and preserve important security metadata.\n\n### Current limitations:\n- **CycloneDX**: SHA-512 hashes are ignored and the hashes field becomes `null`\n- **SPDX**: SHA-512 checksums are completely omitted from the output\n\n\n## Current Behavior\n\n### CycloneDX\nIn `pkg/sbom/cyclonedx/unmarshal.go:251-268`, the `unmarshalHashes` function only supports:\n- SHA1\n- SHA256\n- MD5\n\nAny other algorithm (including SHA-512) logs a warning but still creates a digest with an empty algorithm prefix (e.g., `:hashvalue` instead of `sha512:hashvalue`), resulting in malformed digest strings.\n\n### SPDX\nIn `pkg/sbom/spdx/marshal.go:501-522`, the `spdxChecksums` function has the same limitation, returning `nil` for unsupported algorithms.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe limitation stems from `pkg/digest/digest.go` which only defines three algorithms:\n```go\nconst (\n    SHA1   Algorithm = \"sha1\"\n    SHA256 Algorithm = \"sha256\"\n    MD5    Algorithm = \"md5\"\n)\n```\n\n## Desired Behavior\n\nTrivy should support SHA-512 hash algorithm alongside the existing SHA-1, SHA-256, and MD5 support. This would enable Trivy to:\n- Preserve SHA-512 hashes when processing SBOMs from NPM and other tools\n- Generate SBOMs with SHA-512 hashes when appropriate\n- Maintain full compatibility with CycloneDX and SPDX specifications\n\n\n## Impact\n\n- Loss of package integrity verification data\n- Generated SBOMs may be invalid or incomplete\n- Affects tools that rely on SHA-512 for security validation\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n1. Add SHA512 constant to `pkg/digest/digest.go`:\n   ```go\n   const (\n       SHA1   Algorithm = \"sha1\"\n       SHA256 Algorithm = \"sha256\"\n       SHA512 Algorithm = \"sha512\"\n       MD5    Algorithm = \"md5\"\n   )\n   ```\n\n2. Add SHA-512 calculation support in the digest package\n\n3. Update `unmarshalHashes` in CycloneDX:\n   ```go\n   case cdx.HashAlgoSHA512:\n       alg = digest.SHA512\n   ```\n\n4. Update `spdxChecksums` in SPDX:\n   ```go\n   case digest.SHA512:\n       alg = spdx.SHA512\n   ```\n\n## References\n\n- NPM SBOM documentation: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npm-sbom\n- CycloneDX hash algorithm specification: https://cyclonedx.org/docs/1.6/json/#components_items_hashes\n- SPDX checksum specification: https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/package-information/#79-package-checksum-field\n\n## Test Data\n\n### CycloneDX Example\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"http://cyclonedx.org/schema/bom-1.5.schema.json\",\n  \"bomFormat\": \"CycloneDX\",\n  \"specVersion\": \"1.5\",\n  \"components\": [\n    {\n      \"bom-ref\": \"lodash@4.17.21\",\n      \"type\": \"library\",\n      \"name\": \"lodash\",\n      \"version\": \"4.17.21\",\n      \"hashes\": [\n        {\n          \"alg\": \"SHA-512\",\n          \"content\": \"bf690311ee7b95e713ba568322e3533f2dd1cb880b189e99d4edef13592b81764daec43e2c54c61d5c558dc5cfb35ecb85b65519e74026ff17675b6f8f916f4a\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### SPDX Example\n```json\n{\n  \"spdxVersion\": \"SPDX-2.3\",\n  \"packages\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"lodash\",\n      \"SPDXID\": \"SPDXRef-Package-lodash-4.17.21\",\n      \"checksums\": [\n        {\n          \"algorithm\": \"SHA512\",\n          \"checksumValue\": \"bf690311ee7b95e713ba568322e3533f2dd1cb880b189e99d4edef13592b81764daec43e2c54c61d5c558dc5cfb35ecb85b65519e74026ff17675b6f8f916f4a\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Discussed in https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy/discussions/9082\n",

Add a standalone text link inside a link item\n2. See the broken alignment of the three-dot menu button\n3. Opne three-dot menu and select 'preview'\n4. See broken list\n\n**Expected behavior**\nEither disable the menu to switch between text and preview link inside lists, or fix both showing previews in lists and alignment of the button in lists.\n\n**Server details:**\n- Nextcloud version: 29\n",

The comment above `self.param` may also be relevant here.\n\n### Version\n\nty 0.0.1-alpha.11",

Instead of only considering bindings for attribute assignments, we need to consider both bindings and declarations. Declarations are already correctly recorded in the semantic index, but in type inference, we currently only access the bindings. The patch below may be useful as a reference to see which places in the source code need to change. It switches everything from bindings-only to declarations-only (which would fix the issue here), but of course that needs to be extended to consider both.\n\nJust like when resolving references to normal variables, declarations should take precedence over bindings. That is, even if we see conflicting definitions such as `self.x: int` and `self.x = \"a string\"`, the type of the `x` attribute should just be `int`.\n\n<details>\n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/semantic_index.rs b/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/semantic_index.rs\nindex d4f848e69d..9be2b157d7 100644\n--- a/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/semantic_index.rs\n+++ b/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/semantic_index.rs\n@@ -108,7 +108,7 @@ pub(crate) fn attribute_assignments<'db, 's>(\n     db: &'db dyn Db,\n     class_body_scope: ScopeId<'db>,\n     name: &'s str,\n-) -> impl Iterator<Item = (BindingWithConstraintsIterator<'db, 'db>, FileScopeId)> + use<'s, 'db> {\n+) -> impl Iterator<Item = (DeclarationsIterator<'db, 'db>, FileScopeId)> + use<'s, 'db> {\n     let file = class_body_scope.file(db);\n     let index = semantic_index(db, file);\n \n@@ -116,7 +116,7 @@ pub(crate) fn attribute_assignments<'db, 's>(\n         let place_table = index.place_table(function_scope_id);\n         let place = place_table.place_id_by_instance_attribute_name(name)?;\n         let use_def = &index.use_def_maps[function_scope_id];\n-        Some((use_def.public_bindings(place), function_scope_id))\n+        Some((use_def.public_declarations(place), function_scope_id))\n     })\n }\n \ndiff --git a/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/semantic_index/use_def.rs b/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/semantic_index/use_def.rs\nindex 8ac7f91811..978ce2de7a 100644\n--- a/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/semantic_index/use_def.rs\n+++ b/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/semantic_index/use_def.rs\n@@ -463,10 +463,10 @@ impl<'db> UseDefMap<'db> {\n             .is_always_false()\n     }\n \n-    pub(crate) fn is_binding_reachable(\n+    pub(crate) fn is_declaration_reachable(\n         &self,\n         db: &dyn crate::Db,\n-        binding: &BindingWithConstraints<'_, 'db>,\n+        binding: &DeclarationWithConstraint<'db>,\n     ) -> Truthiness {\n         self.reachability_constraints.evaluate(\n             db,\ndiff --git a/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/types/class.rs b/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/types/class.rs\nindex 3cd7bffa5b..371291a94a 100644\n--- a/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/types/class.rs\n+++ b/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/types/class.rs\n@@ -1744,10 +1744,10 @@ impl<'db> ClassLiteral<'db> {\n                     let method = index.expect_single_definition(method_def);\n                     let method_place = class_table.place_id_by_name(&method_def.name).unwrap();\n                     class_map\n-                        .public_bindings(method_place)\n-                        .find_map(|bind| {\n-                            (bind.binding.is_defined_and(|def| def == method))\n-                                .then(|| class_map.is_binding_reachable(db, &bind))\n+                        .public_declarations(method_place)\n+                        .find_map(|decl| {\n+                            (decl.declaration.is_defined_and(|def| def == method))\n+                                .then(|| class_map.is_declaration_reachable(db, &decl))\n                         })\n                         .unwrap_or(Truthiness::AlwaysFalse)\n                 } else {\n@@ -1762,7 +1762,7 @@ impl<'db> ClassLiteral<'db> {\n             let mut unbound_binding = None;\n \n             for attribute_assignment in attribute_assignments {\n-                if let DefinitionState::Undefined = attribute_assignment.binding {\n+                if let DefinitionState::Undefined = attribute_assignment.declaration {\n                     // Store the implicit unbound binding here so that we can delay the\n                     // computation of `unbound_reachability` to the point when we actually\n                     // need it.

This limits the reach and visibility of the content, making it harder for readers to promote the blogs organically to a broader audience.\n\n### How will this change help?\n\nThis change will ease the sharing of blog amongst social platforms.\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### How could it be implemented/designed?\n\nAdd social sharing buttons to each blog post. These buttons should allow users to share the post on popular platforms such as:\n\n    Twitter\n    LinkedIn\n\nEach button should generate a pre-filled sharing link, including the blog post title, URL, and possibly hashtags. For example:\n\n```Twitter: https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Check+out+this+blog!&url=https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/2024-annual-summary#social-media```\n\nThe buttons should be visually appealing, lightweight, and non-intrusive. They can be displayed at the top or bottom of each blog post.\n\n### \uD83D\uDEA7 Breaking changes\n\nYes\n\n### \uD83D\uDC40 Have you checked for similar open issues?\n\n- [x] I checked and didn't find a similar issue\n\n### \uD83C\uDFE2 Have you read the Contributing Guidelines?\n\n- [x] I have read the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/asyncapi/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n### Are you willing to work on this issue?\n\nYes I am willing to submit a PR!",

      "description" : "Part of #12048\n\n## Issue\nAfter most of the Unit Test migration in #12048, there are a lot of inconsistencies in access control test methods. This is because we did not migrate the many convenient, abstracted, and commonly used access control test methods from `ui/webapi/BaseActionTest.java` to `sqlui/webapi/BaseActionTest.java`.\n\nAfter merging #13254, all of the access control test methods in `BaseActionTest.java` have been migrated. Hence, this issue aims to refactor the unit test access controls to use these convenient test methods.\n\n## Progress\nThe progress for this refactoring can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IcB-viJMrIOknYoBYasBuRBK9qnwY0-doEK4_Eb24IA/edit?gid=0#gid=0). I (the author) will update it when completed PRs are merged proactively.\n\n## Steps to Contribute\n\n1. Choose test(s) to work on in the above Google Sheets link\n2. Check that no on else have claimed the test cases to work on within the last 2 weeks, or that it has been completed by follow up PRs (but not updated in the sheets)\n3. Comment on this issue to indicate that you'd like to contribute on the chosen test(s). Update your comment if you need more than 2 weeks so that other contributors don't overlap with your work.\n4. Create a PR to refactor the unit test(s).\n5. Submit the PR, with a link to this issue by starting the description with \"Part of #13304\"## Tips\n\n- Understand the access control test methods in `sqlui/webapi/BaseActionTest.java`, follow the refactoring in #13254\n- Most of the access control testing logic in the migrated unit tests under `sqlui/webapi` follows the old unit tests under `ui/webapi`, so you may wish to reference the old unit test for help",

(In that, it seems a little inconsistent to accept one but not the other)", "Hey! \uD83D\uDC4B\n\nI needed `isEmpty` to be fully type-safe and handle `null`, so I wrapped `remeda's` version like this (with a little help from GPT):\n\n```ts\n\nimport { isEmpty as REmpty } from \"remeda\";\n\ntype IterableContainer<T = unknown> = ReadonlyArray<T> | readonly [];\n\n// Overload: string | undefined | null\nexport function isEmpty<T extends string | undefined | null>(\n    value: T,\n): value is\n    | (\"\" extends T ? \"\" : never)\n    | (undefined extends T ? undefined : never)\n    | (null extends T ? null : never);\n\n// Overload: iterable containers (like array)\nexport function isEmpty(\n    value: IterableContainer | undefined | null,\n): value is [] | undefined | null;\n\n// Overload: plain object\nexport function isEmpty<T extends object>(\n    value: T | undefined | null,\n): value is Record<keyof T, never> | undefined | null;\n\n// Implementation\nexport function isEmpty(value: unknown): boolean {\n    if (value === null) return true;\n    return REmpty(value as any);\n}\n\n```", "> In Remeda, we prefer the input types be as strict as possible so that you get compile-time errors if a change upstream causes a mismatching type.\n\nI agree with this, but there can be unexpected cases (like human errors), that can make the input be null.

      "description" : "### Steps to reproduce\n\nUse the code below or try dartpad:\n[https://dartpad.dev/?id=06c010125e651e2bfadeecbff2db181a](https://dartpad.dev/?id=06c010125e651e2bfadeecbff2db181a)\nI tested it on the main branch and on the stable one.\n\n### Expected results\n\n`PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber` should return actual frame number on the Web, just like on other platforms.\n\n### Actual results\n\nOn the web `PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber` returns always -1.\nI have tested the code below on the desktop (Windows) and it returns the correct ascending frame numbers. But on the web (via `flutter run -d chrome` or dartpad) this method always returns -1.\nI also found two strange behaviors (potential bugs?).\n1. `frameNumber` has the old value until the end of the transientCallbacks phase. If this is not a bug, it should be documented. The picture below shows a different number in different callbacks during a frame. (underlined in blue)\n2.  `scheduleMicrotask` method calls its callback after the frame ends on the web, and not between `onBeginFrame` and `onDrawFrame` as expected (underlined in red). On the desktop (Windows) it works correctly.\n\n### Code sample\n\n<details open><summary>Code sample</summary>\n\n```dart\nimport 'dart:async';\nimport 'dart:ui';\n\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:flutter/scheduler.dart' show SchedulerBinding, Ticker;\n\nvoid main() {\n  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();\n\n  // ignore: invalid_use_of_protected_member\n  SchedulerBinding.instance.ensureFrameCallbacksRegistered();\n\n  final onBeginFrame = PlatformDispatcher.instance.onBeginFrame;\n  final onDrawFrame = PlatformDispatcher.instance.onDrawFrame;\n\n  PlatformDispatcher.instance.onBeginFrame = (Duration elapsed) {\n    print('+' * 30);\n    final frameNumber = PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber;\n    print('frameNumber from onBeginFrame callback: $frameNumber');\n    onBeginFrame!(elapsed);\n    print('___finish onBeginFrame');\n  };\n\n  PlatformDispatcher.instance.onDrawFrame = () {\n    print('___start onDrawFrame');\n    onDrawFrame!();\n    final frameNumber = PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber;\n    print('frameNumber from onDrawFrame callback: $frameNumber');\n    print('-' * 30);\n  };\n\n  runApp(const App());\n}\n\nclass App extends StatelessWidget {\n  const App({super.key});\n\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return const MaterialApp(debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false, home: Home());\n  }\n}\n\nclass Home extends StatefulWidget {\n  const Home({super.key});\n\n  @override\n  State<Home> createState() => _HomeState();\n}\n\nclass _HomeState extends State<Home> with TickerProviderStateMixin {\n  Ticker? ticker;\n\n  @override\n  void initState() {\n    super.initState();\n\n    SchedulerBinding.instance.addPersistentFrameCallback((_) {\n      final frameNumber = PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber;\n      print('frameNumber from the persistent callback: $frameNumber');\n    });\n\n    ticker = createTicker((_) {\n      final frameNumber = PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber;\n      print('frameNumber from the transient callback: $frameNumber');\n      scheduleMicrotask(() {\n        final frameNumber = PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber;\n        print('frameNumber from the microtask callback: $frameNumber');\n      });\n      SchedulerBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback((_) {\n        final frameNumber = PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber;\n        print('frameNumber from the postframe callback: $frameNumber');\n      });\n    })..start();\n\n    Timer(const Duration(seconds: 1), () {\n      ticker?.dispose();\n      ticker = null;\n    });\n  }\n\n  @override\n  void dispose() {\n    ticker?.dispose();\n    super.dispose();\n  }\n\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return const Placeholder();\n  }\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Screenshots or Video\n\n<details open>\n<summary>Screenshots / Video demonstration</summary>\n\nOn the desktop:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abca8f1d-4d88-4d5a-988e-974c58d0052e)\n\nOn the web:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fcfb6c2-ea1e-4c92-b62f-d7a800e01791)\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Logs\n\n\n\n\n### Flutter Doctor output\n\n<details open><summary>Doctor output</summary>\n\n```console\n[√] Flutter (Channel main, 3.33.0-1.0.pre.619, on Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.19045.5965], locale ru-RU)\n[√] Windows Version (Њ ©Єа®б®дв Windows 10 Pro 64-а §ап¤­ п, 22H2, 2009)\n[√] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 34.0.0)\n[√] Chrome - develop for the web\n[√] Visual Studio - develop Windows apps (Visual Studio Build Tools 2022 17.6.5)\n[√] Android Studio (version 2022.2)\n[√] VS Code (version 1.101.1)\n[√] Connected device (4 available)\n[√] Network resources\n\n• No issues found!\n```\n\n</details>\n",

But on the web (via `flutter run -d chrome` or dartpad) this method always returns -1.\nI also found two strange behaviors (potential bugs?).\n1. `frameNumber` has the old value until the end of the transientCallbacks phase. If this is not a bug, it should be documented. The picture below shows a different number in different callbacks during a frame. (underlined in blue)\n2.  `scheduleMicrotask` method calls its callback after the frame ends on the web, and not between `onBeginFrame` and `onDrawFrame` as expected (underlined in red).

If you want to contribute something relatively small feel free to update one (or more) and make a pull request.

This should be a fairly easy cleanup/replacement as well.\n- [ ] tricontourf\n- [ ] spy\n- [ ] scatterlines\n\nSome recipes may require some more refactoring, like breaking up an `onany` that updates multiple observables.

We just display the price and so on.\n- We should display the category (mandatory), the origins (optional), the labels (optional) and the \"price per\" (unit/kg) (mandatory)\n\n### Steps to reproduce the behavior\n1. Go to a price list like \"My prices\"\n2.

The goal of this project is to evaluate and implement GPU support using Docker.\n\n## Goals\n\n- Demonstrate that a model can run inside a Docker container with GPU access.\n- Build the foundation to support GPU in the Ersilia infrastructure (template, CLI, metadata, CI/CD).\n- Benchmark performance between CPU and GPU runs.\n\n## Step 1: Manual GPU Docker Test (Top-Down)\n\nWe will first verify that models can run in a GPU-enabled Docker container, without relying on Ersilia's internal infrastructure (e.g., CLI or model template).\n\n- [ ] Select two test models:\n  - [ ] One **GPU-only** model (TBD).\n  - [ ] One **GPU/CPU-compatible** model (suggested: FAISS-based).\n- [ ] Set up the new GPU workstation.\n- [ ] Choose and test an appropriate CUDA base image (e.g., `nvidia/cuda:...`).\n- [ ] Ensure image size is acceptable (<~4GB ideally).\n- [ ] Run tests on:\n  - [ ] At least two local GPU workstations.\n  - [ ] One cloud instance (e.g., AWS GPU instance).\n\n## Step 2: Integrate GPU Support into Ersilia Infrastructure\n\n### \uD83E\uDDF1 At the [Ersilia Template](https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos-template) level\n\n- [ ] How should `install.yml` indicate GPU requirements?\n- [ ] If model code differs between CPU/GPU, how should this be reflected in the `framework/`?\n\n### ⚙️ At the [Ersilia CLI](https://github.com/ersilia-os/ersilia) level\n\n- [ ] Add support for `--gpu` or `--cpu` flags in the `ersilia serve` command.\n- [ ] Decide whether GPU/CPU mode should be:\n  - Explicit (user-defined via flag), or\n  - Automatic (detect from hardware?)\n- [ ] Assess: Can one image support both CPU and GPU, or do we need separate ones?\n\n### \uD83D\uDCE6 At the [Ersilia Metadata](https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos5axz/blob/main/metadata.json) level\n\n- [ ] Add `runtime: GPU` / `CPU` or similar field.\n- [ ] Consider `requirements` or `compatibility` sections if needed.\n\n### \uD83D\uDC33 On [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/ersiliaos)\n\n- [ ] Should GPU-compatible images use a separate tag (e.g., `model:gpu`) or separate repo?\n- [ ] Define tagging convention early.\n\n## Step 3: GitHub Actions & CI Integration\n\nIn the [Ersilia Model Workflows](https://github.com/ersilia-os/ersilia-model-workflows):\n\n- [ ] Detect whether a model supports GPU.\n- [ ] Build and push a GPU-compatible Docker image (using `nvidia-docker`).\n- [ ] Ensure existing workflows are not broken.\n\nIn the [Ersilia CLI CI/CD](https://github.com/ersilia-os/ersilia):\n\n- [ ] Add at least one unit test to check GPU execution (on GitHub-hosted runners or self-hosted runner with GPU).\n\n## Step 4: Benchmarking & Validation\n\n- [ ] Run performance benchmarks:\n  - CPU vs GPU execution time.\n  - Memory consumption and constraints.\n- [ ] Record any limitations or environment-specific requirements.",

For example : \n\n```nvidia/cuda:12.9.0-runtime-ubuntu24.04```\n\nThis comes to ~ 2 GB/3 GB depending on the exact CUDA and Ubuntu Version being used. \n\nIdeally run automated tests/builds for different combinations of Ubuntu (or other distributions?) and CUDA  versions. \n\n## CPU vs GPU preliminary testing\n\nA very simple test on TabPFN using a [Sci-Kit Learn Breast Cancer Dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html) showed approximately 3x-4x speed ups when GPU access to the process was enabled, compared to CPU only runs (on the Norrsken GPU Workstation).\n\nMore detailed tests using a [Dataset of approximately 2 Million Compounds](https://github.com/ersilia-os/sars-cov-2-chemspace/blob/main/data/reference_library_inchikeys.csv) showed overwhelming speed-ups with GPU Accelerated similarity searches using [FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss), the difference between search times of GPU and CPU implementations scaled/diverged with the Index size. **It is clearly worth trying to accelerate models using GPU Acceleration.**\n\nWe built indices out of Count Fingerprints of the compounds (converted the SMILES to 2048 Vectors). Cosine Similarity was used as a metric. \n\nFAISS does not support cosine by default, so we use  an `Inner Product` index and perform L2 (Euclidean) Normalisation on the vectors before adding to them to the index (or before searching), which is the equivalent of using Cosine similarity.\n\nTests were ran with index sizes of `10,000`, `100,000`, `500,000` and `1,000,000`. Nearest 100 Neighbours. \n\n### Index size 100,000:\n| Number of Searches | CPU (s) | GPU (s) |\n|--------------------|---------|---------|\n| 100                | 1       | 0.01    |\n| 1,000              | 7.08    | 0.04    |\n| 10,000             | 67.49   | 0.11    |\n| 100,000            | >350    | 1.30    |\n| 500,000            | -       | 5.50    |\n\n### Index size 1,000,000\n\n| Number of Searches | CPU (s) | GPU (s) |\n|--------------------|---------|---------|\n| 100                | 9.42    | 0.02    |\n| 1,000              | 71      | 0.10    |\n| 10,000             | 711     | 1.03    |\n| 100,000            | -       | 10.45   |\n| 500,000            | -       | 52.50   |\n\n\n\n### \n\n<img width=\"765\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e39adae0-7c06-43ba-ba5f-3da89037da02\" />\n\n_NOTE: GPUs are typically higher latency but have higher parallel throughput and memory bandwidth than CPUs. It is best to use batch queries with the CPU or GPU as this amortises the touching of index memory across all of the queries and this is when GPU speed ups are convenient. We will most likely not see any improvements in GPU search times with single queries (if anything it might be slower because of GPU overhead)._\n\n\nThe examples of inference time comparisons and a 3D plot (inference time against index and query sizes), clearly demonstrate **GPUs provide absolutely non-trivial speed ups for the right tasks.**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "# Very Heavy Index (FAISS Flat)\n\nFlat (IP and L2 for example) indices are extremely large (because FAISS only supports Float32 vectors, hence each Fingerprint vector is 32 * 2048 = 65,536 Bits or 4 * 2048=8,192  Bytes), scaling up to millions of vectors means we are dealing with indices that are 10s of GBs.\n\nTried FPSim2 but there are no benefits to GPU accelerating since it does not support batch queries (could be worth looking into CUDA Programming and tuning it to support batch queries, as it supports Sparse Vectors and Tanimoto Search on GPU)\n\n## Promising alternative to Flat FAISS Index: **Approximate Nearest Neighbour (ANN) search**\n\nMost methods for ANN require index training and parameter tuning which makes building the index more complex. We also need to ensure that the training sample is diverse. \n\nPlease note the difference between training and adding to Indices. And index cannot be trained incrementally but can be incrementally added to.\n\nMemory bottlenecks are also an issue so I first train the index and then add vectors to it incrementally in batches. (Although, it is suggested, If possible at all,  add more compute at index build time. (Especially if the index does not change a lot over time))\n\nThe following ANN methods are explored and suggested (compared to ~16 GB with a flat index of around 1.99 million Vectors)\n\n### **_IVFPQ (Inverted File Index with Product Quantisation):_** \n\n#### **_I am yet to do Accuracy tests on IVFPQ but with computational performance (inference time), models seem to enjoy GPU Acceleration speed ups similar to those mentioned above for FAISS Flat indices._**\n\nThis creates very light indices: `~93 MB for an index of around 1.99 Million Vectors`, but there might be a non-trivial loss of accuracy. \n\nNote: For some reason after the index is trained and incrementally built, FAISS takes a lot of time to write it to disk which makes it look like the process is frozen but isn't actually frozen - it goes into an \"uninterruptible sleep\" because of Disk IO, as indicated by the \"D\" state in htop. \n\n### **_HNSWSQ (Hierarchical Navigable Small World Index with Scalar Quantisation)_**\n\nTraining is reasonably fast (with GPU) but adding vectors is computationally intensive and needs to batched appropriately.\n\n#### **_I am yet to do Accuracy tests on HNSWSQ but with computational performance , HNSW seem to enjoy GPU Acceleration only with at Training time as indices are pretty compact and are VERY FAST with CPU and FAISS does not have a GPU search for this yet._**\n\nWhen choosing the strength of quantisation, there is a trade off between memory and accuracy:\n\nIndex of **1.99 million Vectors**:\n\n```\n4.63 GB (~2KB Per Vector + overhead) with a  8-Bit Quantiser while maintaining around 95-98% Accuracy^\n\n\n\n2.59 GB (~1.15KB Per Vector + overhead) with a 4-Bit Quantiser  while maintaining around 90-95% Accuracy^\n```\n\n\nAdding vectors to this kind of index is slow.\n\n_^accuracy according to official documentation and third party tests_\n", "# Metric Learning - Embedding Model\n\nAnother alternative to using vanilla flat indices with 2048 dimensional fingerprints we explore is the use of a metric learning model to create embeddings that are lower dimensions. We use these embeddings to create flat FAISS indices that are much lighter than the standard fingerprint indices (512, 256, 128, 100 dimensional embeddings vs 2048 dimensional fingerprints). We uses torch's GPU version and enjoy non-trivial speed-ups at training time, while creating embeddings and inference time (FAISS Search using a GPU index).\n\nNote: The searches are performed on a flat index, hence are exact searches, but the using of the embedding model means there is an approximation.", "We are aiming to create compound similarity search models with 4 compound libraries:\n\n- ChemDiv (100k)\n- A representative of Enamine  (~9 million)\n- DrugBank (~11k)\n- COCONUT (should be between 500k and 1 Million)\n\nWe also create a _Metric Learning Embedding Model_ out of a [reference library of 2 million compounds.](https://github.com/ersilia-os/sars-cov-2-chemspace/blob/main/data/reference_library_inchikeys.csv).\n\nFor each of the above libraries the aim is to have 3 variants of indices:\n\n- _A flat IP index with L2 Normalisation_\n    - This is going to be very large for libraries with 500k+ compounds)\n\n- _A compressed IVFPQ IP index  with L2 normalisation (FAISS compression)_\n   - This creates very light indices but as mentioned above there is a loss of search accuracy\n\n- _A flat index created with embeddings from the above mentioned model._\n   - This is lets us create indices that are lighter than vanilla flat indices and also lets us have control and confidence over the accuracy of the search (given that we are confident in the embedding model, which is arguably simpler to benchmark).\n \n", "Implemented a metric learning pipeline that creates learned embeddings from existing flat FAISS index. \n\n### Transforms 2048-dimensional fingerprints → _256/128/100-dimensional learned embeddings_ with cosine similarity\n\n### Triplet sampling: Uses existing 2M compound FAISS index for mining hard positives/negatives\n\nEvaluations: ROC-AUC, AP, distance distributions, t-SNE visualizations\n\nThe pipeline maintains L2 normalization throughout for FlatIP cosine similarity and includes model checkpointing + SMILES mapping for deployment.\n\nCreated with PyTorch + FAISS GPU.

      "repositoryName" : "ONEARMY/community-platform",
      "description" : "> Do you have attention to detail and would like to work on making the UI nicer? This issue is then for you! :))\n\n## Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.\n1. Comment section is still not matching the designs. The whitespace is lacking between the nested comments and the visually it looks tight, packed and overwhelming.\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6340e9d-7671-4308-acd0-10bf42bffd4b)\n\n2. Additionally the comment on mobile has spacing from the left, leaving the space not being utilised and making the text unnecessarily squeezed.\n<img width=\"361\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28e206b7-fbe6-471c-a2c4-8f09b1284eeb\" />\n\nEspecially with nested comments it becomes obvious:\n<img width=\"361\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86610c32-e365-414c-868e-02621ca54564\" />\n\n3. If the comment has some enters for new line and the the Show more button shows, it creates an awkward space. There is also gap applied.\n<img width=\"918\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a76486ea-e490-4860-940e-c49498ebeb1e\" />\n\n## Describe the solution you'd like\n\nGenerally I think this will need not only adjusting the numbers, but some minor restructuring of the divs. So, let me try to number the improvements:\n\n---\n\n1. Improving the spacings between the nested comments. In the designs there are also the useful buttons in each comment, that are not yet implemented. In the design however, the spacing occurs naturally because of the useful buttons, so I did not need to add a big margin-bottom. I will leave the solution here up to you, but account for the fact that one day in the future we will introduce the useful button for the comment.\n<img width=\"670\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00f1a492-0cfe-4a26-a6d4-a25e9f1e81d2\" />\n\nDon't be afraid to be generous with the spacings, in the devtools i tried 50px as in my designs\n<img width=\"978\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f23db889-05ba-4607-bedc-25d4a4abc321\" />\n\n---\n\n2. Mobile improvement. Here I upload a gif of the solution that I utilised in the Figma designs - it was to hide the left column with the avatar, allowing the text to stretch and then showing the avatar next to the username in 30x30px size.\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/329f7267-8bdb-4d18-a47c-73b7e44d5478)\n\nDon't forget to make sure that the author's badge is working \n<img width=\"502\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b3012c1-567c-4e5e-b781-5f81852bbe28\" />\n\n\n---\n\n3. Putting the Show More button directly under the comment, trimming the whitespaces. \n<img width=\"947\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c07017f7-60f7-4c1c-92f4-859c1267736f\" />\n\n\n---\n\n4. Decreasing the gap here to 5px from 10px\n<img width=\"404\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a1c56f9-11f3-4bd0-9e52-239948b15c2f\" />\n\n\n\n---\n\n5. As you can see, on mobile it gets quite tight. I would suggest removing the word Published from the \"Published x time ago\" information for the comments.\n<img width=\"322\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe06174a-b402-452b-a18b-eefd38b03192\" />\n\n\n---\n\n6. OPTIONAL - In case you would want to act on the point 5. above even more, I would suggest for mobile screens shortening the formulation even more, saying for example 1h ago, 3mo ago or 2yr ago. Reddit does it this way as well.\n\n<img width=\"182\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c194f4c-a4ee-42a1-9c59-dcd5c6b77e42\" />\n\n---\n\n7. OPTIONAL - In case you would still be up for a challenge, having these 2 aligned on the baseline would be a nice achievement, however I didn't manage to get the desired result, since as you can see below, the align-items:baseline does not align them.\n<img width=\"742\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27968c77-de84-400a-8d3f-22e88b37b627\" />\n\n\n\n##  Additional context - [FIGMA FILE HERE](https://www.figma.com/design/XYV3fr8UVOdkNyBmKHHR7f/CP---Comments-Useful---Mobile?node-id=48-79)\nYou can find the figma file above. You can see the components, the desktop and the mobile versions. These design include the correct answer feature or the useful buttons, which are not yet implemented, so feel free to ignore those.\n\n<img width=\"761\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/119c7345-44cf-4baa-9ef6-feed6a05d7ad\" />\n\nIf you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask. :))",

Cool to see that you are up for tackling these design improvements. \n\nJust yesterday we were talking with Ben, that this issue was in his opinion hard to follow and that the screenshots I included could be a bit confusing (some of them with the useful button, some without), so I thought about rewriting it. Is the issue clear to you though? If so, than let's keep it and if you find anything even slightly unclear you can tag me in the comments at any time and I'll be happy to give more clarification. :))\n\nAlso Ben mentioned that he does not have the capacity to prioritise this at the moment, so this would actually be really really helpful and valuable contribution from you. <3\n\nBen was also wrote yesterday that some of the points I mentioned were implemented already. After checking, it was only the point 5. - removing the word \"Published\" from the timestamp.\n\nI will ask the team about implementing the useful counter and let you know. :))", "@dalibormrska  - I think I understand it, but here let me try to summarize and let me know if I am understanding your requests correctly.\n\n\nRequest 1: Increase spacing between the nested comments.\nSolutions:\n- Long Term Solution: Add the Useful Counter to comments which will naturally add whitespace between the comments\n- Easier Solution: Manually add whitespace between the nested comments (which is the space the Useful Counter will take up later)\n\nRequest 2: When viewing comments (especially reply comments) in mobile, the comment text is extremely narrow.\nSolution: Remove the left side margin (make the comment text and profile image be on the same vertical line). Use the smaller version of the profile picture. Basically try to get to this design:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4045704-088e-4a7c-a7ff-bf3d1c5535b3)\n\nRequest 3: If a comment has alot of line breaks, there could be an awkward gap between the comment text and the 'Show more' button\nSolution: Remove line breaks from the end of the comment when hiding the rest of the comment behind the 'Show more' button\n\nRequest 4: Decrease Gap between profile/upload date line and comment body from 10px to 5px\nSolution: This is straight forward :), just decrease gap from 10px to 5px\n\nRequest 5: Remove the 'Published ... time ago' part of the upload date to save space\nSolution: Already Done :)\n\nRequest 6 (OPTIONAL): The upload date still takes alot of space on mobile\nSolution: Use time short hand in mobile. For example, use '5h ago' instead of '5 hours ago' or '4mo ago' instead of '4 months ago'\n\nRequest 7 (OPTIONAL): The user flag, user name, and upload date are not aligned\nSolution: Align the 3 on the baseline", "Cool, well summarised, it's pretty much spot-on. :)) \n\nThe only thing that got trickier since then is the Request 4. If you run the project locally or are a beta-tester, you will see that now the three-dots menu next to the top-comment has been implemented. The three-dots button is huge however, which makes the whole header of the top-comment taller than the replies and therefore makes it hard to achieve consistent gap.\n\nI don't know however what makes the most sense from the coding best practices - but I imagine if you tackle the Request 2. and include the avatar image in the comment header, then the whole header will get the height of the image. I would then suggest trying to make the image size and the three-dots menu size the same - let's try 35x35px and adjusting the gap accordingly.\n\n<img width=\"747\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be0d2dc1-70f8-41db-b36a-7eda73e85eb2\" />\n\nOther than that we just wait for @benfurber to assign. :))", "I'm sceptical of making the avatar too small, otherwise what's the point of showing it.\n\nIt's yours @JCSergent.\n\nOne thing to note, I'm about to implement some icon changes which includes the pointing down arrow in these screenshots." ],

      "description" : "**Describe the enhancement or change**\nFrom the 9/16/2024 design share session, there was a question brought up regarding the PF [sortable table demo](https://www.patternfly.org/components/table/react-demos/sortable---responsive/). Basically it seems like when the \"Servers\" column is sorted in ascending order, the column is actually sorting in a sort of reverse alphabetical order (\"US-Node-1\" comes first instead of \"Bangalore-Node 1\"). The other columns sort in the expected order based on the sort type.\n\nAs part of this we should take stock of other sortable demos/examples to ensure they're sorting correctly as expected (ignoring columns that don't utilize text, i.e. a \"favorites\" column that only has a star icon button; this will be handled by https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/issues/11006)\n\n**Is this request originating from a Red Hat product team? If so, which ones and is there any sort of deadline for this enhancement?**\n\n**Any other information?**\n",

Although you say it didn’t work, were there any techniques that says it detected? \n\nIn the meantime, I’ll try to find something that could be used as a detection in UTM-VM, but there’s no guarantees. It’s a hard process and the codebase for that project is huge.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that MacOS techniques aren’t our speciality. Although we support it, we don’t really maintain it as Linux and Windows are the most demanded platforms for this sort of project.", "@kernelwernel Thanks for the response, \n\n\nBut I think I have found the solution for that, I have added one more check for detection of Hypervisor in MAC and it helped me.\n\n`sysctl kern.hv_vmm_present` \n\nit helped me to detect UTM.", "@AdnanAhad That’s incredibly useful to know, thanks!

While I don't have a fix yet, we've previously encountered a very similar issue before (https://github.com/kernelwernel/VMAware/issues/359) and all we've done to fix it was by detecting binary translation environments and blacklisting (if found) for those specific techniques, and I'm pretty sure this is the path we'll take but I need to consult with my co-dev (@NotRequiem) who manages these techniques. I assume he's sleeping at the moment, but I'll let him know about the issue.\n\n> You can see in that all hypervisor registers are all zeroes.\n\nThat technique isn't really relevant in this scenario, it's relatively common to have that output.\n\n> I know that a normal hypervisor will return a bendstring when calling CPUID EAX=0x40000000. However, it is a bit strange to see that it is detected as a VM even though it is all 0.\n\nI assume you meant \"brand string\" instead of bendstring, but this is also not surprising since it's a binary translator. I *assume* you have Microsoft PRISM doing the x86 to ARM translation, which isn't really accurate to call it an emulator in itself but that's besides the point.\n\nA lot of funky stuff happens when the binary is being translated to a different ISA, but we still do our best to keep it as compatible as possible with the same core mechanisms we've done for real x86 hardware. We'll let you when there's a fix available.\n\n\n", "I see now that the issue was more complex than I initially thought. It seems I was looking in the wrong direction.

I'm not sure if a diff is the best way to go or not (presumably that would go into benchmarking since it would have to be PR vs. Master). \n\nThe easiest way to get a merge in, that could possibly be migrated to benchmarking later, would be to just run the nsys command with appropriate flags, and it will tell you what the most expensive subroutines are. We have some documentation on nsight profiling in the MFC docs `./mfc.sh run <...> --profile` should work I think. But I think that will just create a report file you look at in the GUI.

Write a brief description of how you will approach the task (without using ChatGPT).\n3. Add your Telegram handler in your application (e.g., in OnlyDust or similar)\n4. Write ETA in your application\n\n\n\n## What should I do if I have a problem\n1. Try to google it before asking. Googling is taking major part of dev work \n2. If you couldn't find answer your question with Google, text your question to [dev](https://t.me/spotnet_dev/4) group with your question.\n3. Do not send DM to maintainer, it would be better and faster to ask other contributors in chat \n\n\n## How to prepare PR\n1. Check if your code [smell](https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/smells) good\n2. Add `close #<issue number>` to link your issue with your PR\n3. Do not commit changes that are unrelated to your task\n4. Check after you created PR, if you committed everything\n\n\n## Task Description\n1. In the [handlers folder](./blob/main/margin/margin_app/app/telegram/handlers), create a new file named `admin.py`. Inside, add a handler called `/assets`. Use the [`Admin Filter` from this issue](https://github.com/djeck1432/spotnet/issues/915) to verify the user is an admin. Then, call the [`Assets statistic` method from this issue](https://github.com/djeck1432/spotnet/issues/906) to retrieve the data. Format the response using Telegram Markdown so it displays neatly.\n2. Provide a screenshot demonstrating that the handler works as expected.\n",

It makes sense for DagRun with multiple versions, but I don't think we should be able to explore DagVersions that are not part of the selected dagrun at all. \n\nIt makes it hard to follow when we start playing with the `version selector` when a DagRun is selected. (Is the DagVersion that I have selected part of the DagRun.dag_versions, or am I watching a completely unrelated structure)\n\n\nFor instance in the following image I have the `v2` structure displayed for a DagRun that actually only has `v4` part of his versions. The output graph doesn't make much sense.\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb45d6a5-514f-464e-b756-39c8b0a70c39)\n\n\nI do not know yet what is the best way to address this, any idea is welcome.\n### Committer\n\n- [x] I acknowledge that I am a maintainer/committer of the Apache Airflow project.",

While it is not explicitly stored in the footer, it can be estimated by analyzing the number of pages via the `OrdinalIndex` and calculating the average page size.  \n\nIt might be worthwhile to include a few functions for inspecting a column's metadata.\n\nFurther more, we can also consider add these column stats into the optimizer statistics system, stored in the `_statistics_.column_statistics` table.\n\n",

The actions-user bot will reset the file back to previous state for the next contributor after your commit is merged. So you can just simply start working with the issue right away!*\r\n\r\n### How to get started:\r\n\r\nStart by navigating inside of the directory used in this project with the command:\r\n```bash\r\ncd tasks/react/medium/traffic-light\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen run `npm i` to install Vite, React and all the necessary dependencies for the project.\r\n\r\nAfter installing the dependencies you can open the `src` directory and the `TrafficLight.tsx` file, and start implementing your solution!\r\n\r\n![react-medium](https://github.com/fork-commit-merge/fork-commit-merge/assets/82566656/e154750d-41fd-4db4-bcc6-9dd52c7e55d6)\r\n\r\n### Description:\r\n\r\nCreate a React component using TypeScript that simulates a traffic light. The component should display three lights (red, yellow, and green) and switch between them automatically in the order of a typical traffic light sequence.\r\n\r\n### Requirements:\r\n\r\n-   Implement a `TrafficLight` component in `src/TrafficLight.tsx`.\r\n-   Use TypeScript for type safety.\r\n-   The component should render three circles, colored red, yellow, and green.\r\n-   The traffic light should start with the red light.\r\n-   After a few seconds, it should change to green, then yellow, and then back to red in a continuous loop.\r\n-   Only one light should be \"active\" (brighter) at a time.\r\n\r\nThere are some CSS classes already added for you in the `src/App.css` file, which you can use if you like, or write your own custom CSS.\r\nThere is for example a helper pseudo-class selector for every light that is not active, which will set the light color to gray if the light does not have the `active` class:\r\n\r\n![react-medium-css](https://github.com/fork-commit-merge/fork-commit-merge/assets/82566656/052aaf61-e4d9-40b9-8876-bf96aa2ada9c)\r\n\r\n### Example:\r\n\r\nThe traffic light should cycle as follows:\r\n\r\n-   Red (active) for 4 seconds.\r\n-   Green (active) for 3 seconds.\r\n-   Yellow (active) for 1 second.\r\n-   Repeat the cycle.\r\n\r\n## How to run:\r\nAfter you are done with the card, make sure you are in the `tasks/react/medium/traffic-light` in your terminal and run `npm run dev` to start the Vite server. Then, open \"http://localhost:5173/\" in your browser to check how the app looks.\r\n\r\nIf it looks to be working fine, you are ready to make a pull request!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo work with this issue, you need to have npm and NodeJS installed to your local machine.\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions of installing npm and NodeJS as well as how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Why use Vite?\r\n\r\nThis React project uses Vite for near-instant server start-ups and incredibly fast hot module replacements, providing a smooth and efficient development experience.\r\nAlso Vite requires minimal setup, allowing us to focus on writing React code without getting bogged down in complex configurations.\r\nIf you want to learn more about Vite, check out the documentation:\r\n[Vite Official Documentation](https://vitejs.dev/)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

Often, these lists will be short (<5 arguments), but there is no guarantee that the JVM will unroll their loops automatically.\n\nFunctions that perform relatively simple operations may benefit from manually unrolled variants that skip loop and conditional checks, and instead have a straight bytecode path for the calculations.\n\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\n\nReview var-args functions, particularly those with numeric arguments and basic calculations. If they are a candidate for loop unrolling, implement and benchmark to prove it is faster.\n\nExamples of var-args functions:\n\n- greatest/least\n- IN\n- CASE\n- coalesce\n- ~l2price~\n- concat\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Full Name:\n\nNick Woolmer\n\n### Affiliation:\n\nQuestDB\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

      "description" : "## Summary\n\nAdd a ```blob([mimeType: string])``` method to ```DotNetStreamReference``` in Blazor, allowing developers to obtain a Blob from a .NET stream in JavaScript, without fully loading the stream into memory. We chose this specific issue, because it is a \"good-first-issue\" and we are participating in a germany wide competition, where the subject is to work on issues in open source projects. \nLink to issue: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/47685\n\n## Motivation and goals\n\nBlazor developers can currently pass .NET streams to JavaScript using ```DotNetStreamReference```, which exposes two main methods:\n- ```stream()``` (returns a ReadableStream)\n- ```arrayBuffer()``` (loads the full stream into memory)\n\nThe problem:\n- There is no direct way to obtain a Blob, which is required for many web APIs (like ```<video>``` elements, file downloads or drag-and-drop functionality).\n- ```arrayBuffer()``` is not suitable for large files (like videos) because it fully buffers the stream in memory before use.\n- Using ```stream()``` gives a ReadableStream, but many APIs (like ```<video src=...>```, ```URL.createObjectURL()```) require a Blob, not a stream, and converting a ReadableStream into a Blob in JS is non-trivial and inefficient.\n\nAdding a ```blob()``` method would:\n- Allow efficient handling of large files (like video or audio) without consuming excessive memory.\n- Simplify developer workflows by aligning with common web APIs that expect a Blob.\n- Close a usability gap in the current Blazor-JS interop system.\n\n## In scope\n\n- A new method ```blob([mimeType: string])``` on ```DotNetStreamReference``` that returns a Blob representing the .NET stream.\n- Ensuring the Blob can be used with standard web APIs (e.g., ```<video>```, ```<audio>```, ```URL.createObjectURL()```).\n- Keeping performance and memory usage efficient for large streams.\n\n## Out of scope\n\n- Changes to the existing stream() or arrayBuffer() methods.\n- Polyfills for browsers that lack Blob support (modern browsers are assumed).\n- Enhancements to streaming APIs beyond providing the Blob.\n\n## Risks / unknowns\n- **Browser behavior**: While Blobs are widely supported, the implementation detail of\nstreaming data into a Blob without full buffering might depend on browser internals.\nSome browsers may still buffer the entire Blob in memory before making it available.\n\n- **Memory use**: Even if we avoid buffering in .NET or JS, the underlying browser may still\nend up consuming memory when the Blob is accessed, especially for very large files.\n\n- **Implementation complexity**: Creating a Blob from a .NET stream across JS interop\nmight require platform-level work to ensure true streaming behavior rather than just\nbuffering and converting.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Blazor usage example\n```blazor\n<video @ref=\"videoPlayer\" controls autoplay></video>\n\n<button @onclick=\"PlayVideo\">Play Streamed Video</button>\n\n@code {\n    private ElementReference videoPlayer;\n\n    private async Task PlayVideo()\n    {\n        using var fileStream = File.OpenRead(\"bigvideo.mp4\");\n        var streamRef = new DotNetStreamReference(fileStream);\n\n        // JS call to create a blob URL from the .NET stream\n        var videoUrl = await JS.InvokeAsync<string>(\"createVideoBlobUrl\", streamRef);\n\n        // Set the video source\n        await JS.InvokeVoidAsync(\"setVideoSrc\", videoPlayer, videoUrl);\n    }\n}\n```\n### JavaScript interop\n```JavaScript\nwindow.createVideoBlobUrl = async function (streamRef) {\n    const blob = await streamRef.blob(\"video/mp4\");\n    return URL.createObjectURL(blob);\n};\n\nwindow.setVideoSrc = function (videoElement, src) {\n    videoElement.src = src;\n};\n```\n",

It is also extremely useful for testing, tbh, but also some potential future privacy/security concerns.

      "description" : "# Background\nHi community,\n\nShardingSphere's parser engine enables users to parse SQL into AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) and convert it into SQLStatement objects. \nThis issue focuses on enhancing MySQL stored procedure parsing capabilities to support complex database programming logic.\n\nMore details:\nhttps://shardingsphere.apache.org/document/current/en/reference/sharding/parse/\n\n# Issue Background Explanation\n\nThese SQL statements are from the official MySQL test set. \nYou can find the corresponding stored procedure SQL statements in the following website: https://github.com/mysql/mysql-server/tree/8.0/mysql-test/t \nThese SQL cases are then passed to ShardingSphere's parsing engine for analysis. \nFor SQL cases that fail to be parsed successfully, every 3 to 5 SQL cases are grouped together as an issue.\n1. It cannot be guaranteed that all SQL cases are correct. Please follow the following process to handle this pull request (PR).\n2. Some SQL cases may have already been fixed in other PRs. For cases that can already be executed successfully, simply leave a comment to ignore them.\n3. If a SQL case can be executed successfully without any code changes, there is no need to add a corresponding test assert file.\n\n# Task\nThis issue requires adding support for the following MySQL stored procedure syntax:\n```sql\n-- The original file and line number of the sql: analyze:85 \nCREATE PROCEDURE p() ANALYZE TABLE v UPDATE HISTOGRAM ON w\n```\n\n```sql\n-- The original file and line number of the sql: change_user_deadlock:35 \nEND |\nCREATE PROCEDURE p_processlist()\nBEGIN\nDECLARE x INT DEFAULT 3000\n```\n\n```sql\n-- The original file and line number of the sql: change_user_deadlock:26 \nCREATE PROCEDURE p_flush_status()\nBEGIN\nDECLARE x INT DEFAULT 3000\n```\n\n```sql\n-- The original file and line number of the sql: clear_diag_area:254 \nCREATE PROCEDURE p7_show_warnings ()\nBEGIN\nSHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'foo';\nSHOW WARNINGS;\nSELECT \"(SHOW WARNINGS does not have to come last)\";\nEND\n```\n\n```sql\n-- The original file and line number of the sql: clear_diag_area:263 \nCREATE PROCEDURE p8b_show_warnings ()\nBEGIN\nSHOW WARNINGS;\nEND\n```\n\n\n# Overall Procedure\nIf you intend to participate in fixing this issue, please feel free to leave a comment below the issue. Community members will assign the issue accordingly.\nFor example, you can leave a comment like this: \"Hi, please assign this issue to me. Thank you!\"\n\nOnce you have claimed the issue, please review the syntax of the SQL on the official website of the corresponding database. \nExecute the SQL on the respective database to ensure the correctness of the SQL syntax.\n\nYou can check the corresponding source of each SQL case on the official database website.\nNext, execute the problematic SQL cases mentioned above in the database (you can quickly start the corresponding database using the Docker image for that database, and then connect to it using a client you are  familiar with), to ensure that the SQL syntax itself is correct.\n\n\nOnce you have confirmed the correctness of the SQL syntax, you can validate and fix the grammar parsing issue in ShardingSphere.\n>If you are using IntelliJ IDEA, you will need to install the ANTLR plugin before proceeding.\nIf it is an ANTLR parsing error message, try to repair the `.g4` file by comparing it with the official database syntax until the SQL can be correctly parsed by ANTLR.\nWhen there is no error message in the ANTLR Preview window, it means that ANTLR can correctly parse the SQL.\n\n\nAfter ANTLR parses SQL into an abstract syntax tree, ShardingSphere will access the abstract syntax tree through Visitor and extract the required information.\nIf you need to extract Segments, you need to first execute:\n```shell\nmvn -T 2C clean install -DskipTests\n```\nUnder the shardingsphere-parser module to compile the entire parser module.\nThen rewrite the corresponding visit method in SQLStatementVisitorr as needed to extract the corresponding Segment.\n\n\nAfter the above SQL parsing problem is repaired, the corresponding Test needs to be added.\nThe steps are as follows:\n1. Add the corresponding `sql-case` in the `sql/supported` directory.\n2. Add case assertions in the case directory of the `shardingsphere-test-it-parser` module.\n3. Run `org.apache.shardingsphere.test.it.sql.parser.internal.InternalSQLParserIT`\nAfter SQL Parser IT runs successfully, you can submit a PR.\n\n\n1. Master JAVA language\n2. Have a basic understanding of Antlr g4 file\n3. Be familiar with MySQL SQLs",

The actions-user bot will reset the file back to previous state for the next contributor after your commit is merged. So you can just simply start working with the issue right away!*\r\n\r\n## How to get started\r\n\r\nStart by opening the `tasks/python/medium` directory from the root of the project. \r\nThen open `bubble_sort.py` file and start working on your solution!\r\n\r\n![python-medium](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/assets/82566656/b32978ed-2a26-48d8-9bd4-322cf1916586)\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThe goal of this issue is to implement the bubble sort algorithm in Python. The function should be able to sort an array of integers in ascending order. You should create a function called `bubble_sort` to accomplish this.\r\n*Note: Do not use the `sort` function or any similar methods to solve this task.*\r\n\r\n## How to run\r\n\r\nMake sure you are in the right directory:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncd tasks/python/medium\r\n```\r\n\r\nExecute the following command to run your Python script:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npython bubble_sort.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected output\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nOriginal array: [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]\r\nSorted array: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the output looks correct, you are ready to make a pull request!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo work with this issue, you need to have Python installed to your local machine.\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions of installing Python and how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

Validate the stored context before using it\n2. Add proper fallback logic when an invalid context is detected\n3. Provide clear user feedback about what's happening\n\nIs this approach aligned with what you're looking for?

This is either an upstream issue or we might need to switch over to using [proxy-agent](https://www.npmjs.com/package/proxy-agent) from the same maintainer, which proxies \uD83D\uDE02 calls based on the set env-variables.\n\nMid/Long-term, Bitwarden CLI will likely benefit moving over to using native NodeJS fetch support and proxy via [undici](https://github.com/nodejs/undici). I looked into this a while ago, but it hasn't been a priority to migrate.\n\nMarking this as good first issue, in case anyone would like to start investigating.\n\nKind regards,\nDaniel", "@djsmith85 @frq-asgard-josi\n\nI did some digging, and here's my theory.\n\n[proxy-agent](https://github.com/TooTallNate/proxy-agents/blob/main/packages/proxy-agent) depends on [proxy-from-env](https://github.com/Rob--W/proxy-from-env) to process proxy-related environment variables.\n\nThe [logic](https://github.com/Rob--W/proxy-from-env/blob/master/index.js#L64) in `proxy-from-env` for interpreting `NO_PROXY` may be the root cause.\n\n```js\nfunction shouldProxy(hostname, port) {\n  var NO_PROXY =\n    (getEnv('npm_config_no_proxy') || getEnv('no_proxy')).toLowerCase();\n  if (!NO_PROXY) {\n    return true;  // Always proxy if NO_PROXY is not set.\n  }\n  if (NO_PROXY === '*') {\n    return false;  // Never proxy if wildcard is set.\n  }\n}\nfunction getEnv(key) {\n  return process.env[key.toLowerCase()] || process.env[key.toUpperCase()] || '';\n}\n```\n\n`npm_config_no_proxy` has higher priority, and if set, `no_proxy` or `NO_PROXY` won't be effective. This [issue](https://github.com/Rob--W/proxy-from-env/issues/13) and [fix](https://github.com/Rob--W/proxy-from-env/pull/27) are still open.\n" ],

      "description" : "This is a top-level issue for tracking the manual porting of ethereum/tests test cases to execution-spec-tests:\r\n\r\n> **Contributions to manually port individual test cases are very welcome!**\r\n\r\n**If you're already familiar with ethereum/tests and execution-spec-tests, jump to the issue tracker below!**\r\n\r\n#### Background\r\n[ethereum/tests](https://github.com/ethereum/tests) was the repository used to define EVM test cases from [Frontier](https://ethereum.org/en/history/#frontier) up to and including [The Merge](https://ethereum.org/en/history/#paris). The test cases are defined as YAML (and sometimes JSON) files in the [./src/ sub-directory](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/tree/develop/src) and the JSON \"test fixtures\" (fully-populated tests that can be executed against clients) are generated using [ethereum/retesteth](https://github.com/ethereum/retesteth). These JSON artifacts are regenerated when required and added to the repository, for example, in the [./GeneralStateTests/ sub-directory](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/tree/develop/GeneralStateTests).\r\n\r\nFrom [Shanghai](https://ethereum.org/en/history/#shapella) on, new test cases (in particular for new features included in hard-forks) have been defined in Python in this repository (execution-spec-tests). The existing test cases are still important to execute against clients, however, and porting ethereum/tests to execution-spec-tests ensures that the test cases can be continually maintained and filled (generated) for newer forks. It also has the advantage that client teams will only need to obtain test fixture releases from one source.\r\n\r\n#### Automated Port to Python\r\nAlthough there will be an effort to automate (\"transpile\") the remaining test cases from YAML (respectively JSON) to Python; contributions to manually port individual test cases can be very beneficial and are welcome! \r\n\r\nThe benefits of manual porting are:\r\n1. Reduce the number of test cases by combing multiple YAML (resp. JSON) test cases in one Python test function (via parametrization).\r\n2. Potentially improve coverage by parametrizing the Python version.\r\n3. Code/docstrings are likely higher quality than an automated conversion.\r\n4. The test can be better [organized within the `./tests` folder](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-spec-tests/main/writing_tests/adding_a_new_test/) in execution-spec-tests by the fork and the EIP in which the functionality was introduced.\r\n\r\n#### Process\r\n1. Pick a single or a set of YAML test cases in ethereum/tests to port and create an issue in this repository - optional, but definitely recommended if porting tests from the tracker below to avoid duplicate work.\r\n2. Create a PR with the ported tests:\r\n    a. Add the list of ported YAML files to [converted-ethereum-tests.txt](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/blob/1b30c336eae6b0746ea4db441ac74406f2fb2322/converted-ethereum-tests.txt).\r\n    b. If the tests can't currently be filled, please explain the issue (feel free to also [open a Discussion](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/discussions/new?category=general)).\r\n\r\n#### Help with ethereum/tests\r\n\r\nThe test formats are described in the [ethereum/tests online docs](https://ethereum-tests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/blockchain-ref.html). Note that state filler test cases in YAML can be parametrized, see the [docs here](https://ethereum-tests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/test_filler/state_filler.html#the-indexes).\r\n\r\n#### Hints to Get Started with ethereum/execution-spec-tests\r\n\r\n0. Start here: [Getting Started → Installation](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-spec-tests/main/getting_started/installation/).\r\n1. Use `uv run et make test` to create a template test module (currently a WIP in #950).\r\n2. Where to put the test? See how tests are organized in [Writing Tests → Adding a New Test](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-spec-tests/main/writing_tests/adding_a_new_test/).\r\n3. State vs Blockchain test? If in doubt try to write a state test, see [Writing Tests → Types of Tests → Deciding on a Test Type](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-spec-tests/main/writing_tests/types_of_tests/#deciding-on-a-test-type).\r\n4. Tests are filled via EELS by default (no further installation necessary; it's a Python dependency and got installed in Step 0), see [Filling  → Getting Started](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-spec-tests/main/filling_tests/getting_started/).\r\n5. Parametrizing test functions is encouraged, see [Writing Tests → Writing a New Test → Parametrizing Tests](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-spec-tests/main/writing_tests/writing_a_new_test/#parametrizing-tests).\r\n6. The Opcode mini-lang defined in this repository is the preferred way to define bytecode in tests (if feasible). For a very simple example, see [`test_chainid()`](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/blob/85393456e75f5f3b476cb5e61c35d48172f9d543/tests/istanbul/eip1344_chainid/test_chainid.py#L28) - there are other examples in the tests.\r\n\r\nFeel free to reach out for help or guidance in the Ethereum R&D discord or via DM; see [Getting Help](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-spec-tests/main/getting_started/getting_help/) in the docs.\r\n\r\n```[tasklist]\r\n### Test Cases\r\n- [ ] Add test cases for any single opcode (porting an entire test case from ethereum/tests can be overwhelming;

It would be great to have lower cost for `equalsData`, but implementing it properly is quite challenging, so we should first check if the impact is worth the trouble.\n\nThis issue is for replaying all the on-chain evaluation events using the #7138 branch recording the budget and success results.
