If you imagine a 3rd party project wanting to utilise libartifact wouldn't have use for the event logic. ", "I lean towards option 2, using a similar mechanism to what we use for libimage - https://github.com/containers/container-libs/blob/main/common/libimage/runtime.go#L70\n\nWe have a channel to send events. That channel can be set up when you initialize the library, but it doesn't need to be. Podman will pass a channel, other users will not.\n\nThis is the best way as the `pkg/domain/infra/abi` endpoints do not guarantee that events are always emitted. If I have a codepath in, say, `play kube` that calls directly into libartifact, there would be no event - despite an artifact being created.", "> I lean towards option 2, using a similar mechanism to what we use for libimage - https://github.com/containers/container-libs/blob/main/common/libimage/runtime.go#L70\n> \n> We have a channel to send events.

If I have a codepath in, say, `play kube` that calls directly into libartifact, there would be no event - despite an artifact being created.\n\nOhh that's a great point about the channel being optional @mheon , I forgot about that!", "I was missing the complete picture of the event processing architecture for each component. Thanks! \uD83D\uDE47 This approach looks better, as it guarantees that other code paths using `container-libs/common/pkg/libartifact` can receive events through the channel, if one is provided.\n\n@mheon Would it be okay if I ask a couple of questions to check if we are on the same page?\n\n(1) To use a similar mechanism, we would need to have a goroutine for receiving artifact events, right? https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/905721cae54adb755605a545fb2c6a5dd6404b1a/libpod/runtime.go#L687\n\n(2) For the same reasons, it seems the `Network` event handling would potentially benefit from a similar refactoring in the future, given that it also depends on https://github.com/containers/container-libs/blob/97d630e8ce5b090c45c646f8669866b8958722c3/common/libnetwork/netavark/network.go#L24\n", "Point 1 is accurate; the channel needs something reading it. Shouldn't be a big deal resource-wise as the channel will just block until events happen and won't be scheduled otherwise.\n\nFor point 2, I would generally agree. I believe @ashley-cui is working on a refactor of some of that code now that could include this?", "Thanks! Got it. I want to work on this issue, through below the process. If there are something different with your thought, please tell me. This is the biggest task I've ever worked on in `Podman` so I want to get a confirmation from you. ???I'd appreciate your guidance when you have a moment. \uD83D\uDE47 \n\n**1. container-libs**\n  - Making a issue for this\n  - common/pkg/libartifact/events.go\n    - Adding required event type, struct, function\n    - E.g. https://github.com/containers/container-libs/blob/main/common/libimage/events.go\n  - common/pkg/libartifact/store/store.go\n    - Adding eventChannel as a member variable\n    - Adding event sending logics at each method such as Add\n    - E.g. https://github.com/containers/container-libs/blob/36964d15757a4c8abea44e5fdac0cb31d98f3684/common/libimage/push.go#L106\n\n**2. podman**\n- docs/source/markdown/podman-events.1.md\n  - documentation\n- libpod/runtime.go\n  - Adding `Runtime` method, which make a goroutine for getting artifact events through the channel. \n  - This method is called when initializing runtime.ArtifactStore\n- libpod/events.go, libpod/events/config.go, libpod/events/events.go, libpod/events/journal_linux.go, libpod/events/logfile.go\n  - Adding codes for handling artifact events in podman\n- test/e2e/events_test.go\n  - Adding e2e test for checking artifact events working properly." ],

This only occurs when you open the picker and do not change the value. I'm guessing there are some internal text fields when `Editable` is `true` and validation is failing on those for whatever reason.\n\n### Reproduction link\n\nhttps://try.mudblazor.com/snippet/ckGfEiPHqXExJHsx\n\n### Reproduction steps\n\nThe following steps assume you've navigated to the try.mudblazor.com link posted in this issue.\n1. Click calendar picker adornment.\n2. Click outside of calendar picker without selecting a new date range to close it\n3. Click validate button\n4. See validation error\n\n# Video Example\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2476973-e686-42d7-a9c6-f0cfd48c0d04\n\n### Version (bug)\n\n8.7.0\n\n### Version (working)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Environment\n\nChrome\n\n### Blazor rendering mode\n\nServer",

A user, charlesninane94, has flagged a JavaScript error with `MudFocusTrap`, specifically \"Unable to focus an invalid element.\" This is occurring in production environments using Blazor Hybrid, though they can't replicate it in development. The issue has the labels `bug`, `has workaround`, `needs: reproduction`, and `blazor: hybrid`.\nFirst, I need to check the labels against our Assistant Behavior Policy. The `bug` label seems accurate, given the unexpected JS error. The `has workaround` label is justified since a maintainer linked to a potentially related issue, and another contributor offered detailed JS patches. The key here is the `needs: reproduction` label. The original reporter hasn't provided one, and a contributor has *explicitly* requested it.\nThe `blazor: hybrid` label, however, is a potential issue. The policy is very clear; we should only apply an environment label if the impact is exclusive to that environment. Here, the author only stated that they're *using* Blazor Hybrid, not that the problem only exists there. They mention a difference between development and production, but that doesn't define Hybrid vs. Server/WASM. The bot's earlier addition of this label was likely incorrect based on this strict interpretation. I will remove this label.\nNow, let's consider the inactivity aspect.  The last human comment was from a contributor, over 28 days ago, who requested a reproduction. Since it's been more than 28 days with the `needs: reproduction` label, and no new information, the \"stale\" rule applies.\nBased on this, my plan is: Keep `bug`, `has workaround`, and `needs: reproduction`. Remove the `blazor: hybrid` label.  Add the `stale` label. And post the required \"stale\" comment to the issue: \"This issue has been marked as stale due to inactivity. If you have any updates or additional information, please comment below. If no response is received, it will be automatically closed.\"\nThat should triage this issue appropriately and align with the policy.\n-->", "I got the error too, and I am able to reliably reproduce the bug.\nThe heart of the issue lies in MudFocusTrap.razor.cs OnAfterRenderAsync.\n\nIn short, if you have pressed \"Ok\" (closed) on the dialog quickly enough and lucky enough for the race condition to occur, then InitializeFocusAsync will be called after disposal, causing the crash. By lucky enough to occur, it needs to be still in OnAfterRenderAsync for the firstRender. So most likely it will only occur on slower machines, which is why most people only see it in production once published etc... There already is a `if (_disposed) return;` at the top of the method before the saving of focus, but this is not enough.\nThe fix is extremely simple, there needs to be another `if (_disposed) return; ` before the second part of OnAfterRenderAsync. This is because we are awaiting SaveFocusAsync, and when the method continues, disposal could have already happened.\n\nTo reproduce this reliably, you can modify OnAfterRenderAsync and put a delay in.\n\n```\n protected override async Task OnAfterRenderAsync(bool firstRender)\n {\n     await base.OnAfterRenderAsync(firstRender);\n\n     if (_disposed) return;\n     if (firstRender)\n     {\n         await SaveFocusAsync();\n     }\n\n     Debug.WriteLine(\"Delay by 3 seconds to test issue\");\n     await Task.Delay(3000);\n\n     if (!_initialized)\n     {\n         await InitializeFocusAsync();\n     }\n }\n```\n\nThen simply open a dialog, and press Ok straight away to close it. Then wait a second or two, and the server will crash.\n\nTo fix, it's as simple as:\n```\nprotected override async Task OnAfterRenderAsync(bool firstRender)\n{\n    await base.OnAfterRenderAsync(firstRender);\n\n    if (_disposed) return;\n    if (firstRender)\n    {\n        await SaveFocusAsync();\n    }\n\n    // need to check _disposed again because it could have changed during await\n    if (_disposed) return;\n    if (!_initialized)\n    {\n        await InitializeFocusAsync();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nDo I submit code for this, or is it handled by the team?\n\nThanks for all your work! MudBlazor is great.\n\n", "Hello @jpacc260,\n\nThank you for the excellent and detailed analysis, including the reliable reproduction steps and a proposed fix.

If I missed something or made a mistake, please let me know in a reply!*\n\n<!--\n**Here's the plan:**\nAlright, I've got this one.  A user's reported a JavaScript error in `MudFocusTrap`, and they've given us a reproduction and a suggested fix. My analysis is as follows:\n1.  **Understand the issue and timeline:** This is about a focus trap error in Blazor Hybrid.  The issue has been open for a while, originally tagged as needing reproduction, which now is no longer the case.\n2.  **Evaluate the new information:** A new comment from `jpacc260` offers a solid reproduction and pinpoints a race condition in `OnAfterRenderAsync` with a `Task.Delay`. They've even provided the fix, which involves a simple null check.\n3.  **Cross-reference with the policy:** The 'needs reproduction' is no longer accurate, and the 'stale' label is now irrelevant due to the new comment. The 'bug' and 'has workaround' labels still apply.\n4.  **Decide on actions, guided by policy:**\n    *   I'll remove the 'needs reproduction' and 'stale' labels, and add the 'good first issue' label. The fix seems straightforward and contained.\n    *   I'll thank `jpacc260` for the detailed analysis and invite them to submit a pull request, providing helpful resources. I'll make sure to use their user name in the reply to directly address their question.\n5.  **Construct the comment:** I'll draft a helpful and encouraging response, thanking them for the investigation and suggesting a PR.\n    *   I'll add the standard footer as well.\nThis seems like a straightforward and beneficial update to this issue. It allows this information to be easily addressed by another team member. Let's get this done.\n-->" ],

      "description" : "### Problem Description\nWhen playing the **InkDrinker 1** level (*scene: `ink_combat_round_1`*) with an aspect ratio different from **16:9** (for example, *21:9* or *4:3*), the camera bounds allow parts of the scene to be visible that were not meant to be seen.  \nThis happens when the game window expands horizontally or vertically, exposing areas outside the region \"dressed\" by the level designer.\n\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Open the project in the **Godot** editor.  \n2. In **Project Settings**, enable **Debug Aspect Ratio**.  \n3. Start the level **InkDrinker 1** (*scene: `ink_combat_round_1`*).  \n4. Resize the window (for example, make it wider or taller).  \n5. Observe that the camera shows undesigned or empty areas outside the intended playable region.\n\n\n### Expected Result\nThe camera should remain within the designed playable area and not display regions outside the intended environment.\n\n---\n\n### Suggested Fix\nThis issue could be resolved by **adding more decoration (e.g., water)** around the edges of the scene and **adjusting the camera limits** so that the view stays centered on the action.  \n\n>[!NOTE]\n>- Found while testing the main issue #1083 .\n>- Scene path: `res://scenes/quests/lore_quests/quest_001/2_ink_combat/ink_combat_round_1.tscn`",

      "description" : "## Proposal for `rows_hide()` function\r\n\r\nAfter the gt object has been created and formatted, it is possible to hide particular columns. There are cases were hiding rows would also be useful. \r\n\r\nThis is especially important for groups of data scientists where `gt` is the basis of table formatting. For example, complex report tables with titles, footnotes, and other styling choices might get made by some centralized process, but then individuals might want to grab the stylized table, select just certain rows and columns, and then update the title but *not* have to worry about copying over the footnotes or other formatting details.\r\n\r\n    # Some function has produced a table\r\n    my_table <- iris |>\r\n      group_by(Species) |>\r\n      summarize(across(where(is.numeric), mean)) |>\r\n      gt(rowname_col = 'Species') |>\r\n      # Now have a bunch of formating\r\n      gt::tab_header('Some Title')\r\n    \r\n    # And now I need to take extract just a subset of the rows/colums\r\n    # for a report, but we shouldn't copy/paste all of the formatting\r\n    # code\r\n    \r\n    my_table |>\r\n      cols_hide(contains('Sepal')) # this works to hide extraneous columns...\r\n    \r\n    # But why isn't there a rows_hide() equivalent? What if I need to \r\n    # hide the setosa row?\r\n    my_table |>\r\n      cols_hide(contains('Sepal')) |>\r\n      rows_hide(Species == 'setosa')   # This function doesn't exist.\r\n\r\nI would expect that `rows_hide()` would be able to specify a body row in all the usual ways that `cells_body(rows=)` can select rows.\r\n\r\nLooking into the code for `cols_hide()`, it appears that there is a flag being set that marks if the column is to be displayed. Is it reasonable to create a corresponding rows flag that will control if a particular row is displayed?\r\n\r\nA design question is \"What to do if there are summary rows?\" Because we are *hiding* (and not removing), I think that the summary rows shouldn't be changed. However, there should be a way to also hide the `summary_row()` output.  ",

The two offenders I know off are:\n\n- https://github.com/go-git/go-git/blob/0ba20950388d620d0c5de4d5e09e590c4e4f7099/internal/transport/test/receive_pack.go#L23\n- https://github.com/go-git/go-git/blob/0ba20950388d620d0c5de4d5e09e590c4e4f7099/internal/transport/test/common.go#L9\n\nHowever, there may be more.", "@pjbgf I've been looking into the above about only having to download go-git-fixtures when it comes to testing but to me it looks like from a go stand point, it doesn't actually seem possible. Go just seems to add everything to go.mod file regardless of being within a *_test.go file or test only package `package common_test`. Go does seem to know its a test only import, you can use following command `go list -json` to find `\"TestImports\"`.\n\nI think its safe to assume when a binary built it isn't linked despite requiring a download when imported. I did come across a example of using different go.mod files for the final package and one for testing. However, it seems quite hacky. Basically having an external package within same the repository testing your main package with the same repository, which means it only has access to public interfaces that the main packages exports.\n\nI don't know enough about go-git-fixtures but if the data/ being serializable for each test, maybe it could be moved out of repository and downloaded at runtime from a different location when `go test` is run?" ],

      "comments" : [ "# :wave: Important: PLEASE READ :wave:\n\nThis issue has been labeled as a **good first issue** and is available for anyone to work on.\n\nIf this is your first time contributing to an open source project, some aspects of the development process may seem unusual, arcane, or some combination of both.\n\n1.  **You cannot \"claim\" issues.** People new to open source often want to \"claim\" or be assigned an issue before beginning work. The typical rationale is that people want to avoid wasted work in the event that someone else ends up working the issue. However, this practice is not effective in open source, as it often leads to \"issue squatting\", in which an individual asks to be assigned, is granted their request, and then never ends up working on the issue. Accordingly, you are encouraged to communicate your intent to address this issue, ideally by providing a rough outline as to how you plan to address the issue or asking clarifying questions, but, at the end of the day, we will take running code and rough consensus in order to move forward quickly.\n2.  **We have a very high bar for contributions.** We have very high standards for contributions and expect all contributions???whether new features, tests, or documentation???to be rigorous, thorough, and complete. Once a pull request is merged into stdlib, that contribution immediately becomes the collective responsibility of all maintainers of stdlib. When we merge code into stdlib, we are saying that we, the maintainers, commit to reviewing subsequent changes and making bugfixes to the code. Hence, in order to ensure future maintainability, this naturally leads to a higher standard of contribution.\n\nBefore working on this issue and opening a pull request, please read the project's [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md). These guidelines and the associated [development guide](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/docs/contributing/development.md) provide important information, including links to stdlib's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), license policy, and steps for setting up your local development environment.\n\nTo reiterate, we **strongly** encourage you to refer to our contributing guides **before** beginning work on this issue. Failure to follow our guidelines significantly decreases the likelihood that you'll successfully contribute to stdlib and may result in automatic closure of a pull request without review.\n\nSetting up your local development environment is a critical first step, as doing so ensures that automated development processes for linting, license verification, and unit testing can run prior to authoring commits and pushing changes. If you would prefer to avoid manual setup, we provide pre-configured [development containers](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/tree/develop/.devcontainer) for use locally or in GitHub Codespaces.\n\nWe place a high value on consistency throughout the stdlib codebase. We encourage you to closely examine other packages in stdlib and attempt to emulate the practices and conventions found therein.\n\n-   If you are attempting to contribute a new package, sometimes the best approach is to simply copy the contents of an existing package and then modify the minimum amount necessary to implement the feature (e.g., changing descriptions, parameter names, and implementation).\n-   If you are contributing tests, find a package implementing a similar feature and emulate the tests of that package.\n-   If you are updating documentation, examine several similar packages and emulate the content, style, and prose of those packages.\n\nIn short, the more effort you put in to ensure that your contribution looks and feels like stdlib???including variables names, bracket spacing, line breaks, etc???the more likely that your contribution will be reviewed and ultimately accepted. We encourage you to closely study the codebase **before** beginning work on this issue.\n\n:sparkles: Thank you again for your interest in stdlib, and we look forward to reviewing your future contributions. :sparkles:\n" ],

There is no other recovery then manually rebooting the ESP32.\nThis is a catastrophic bug for any production deployement.\n\nThis behavior is new in firmware 1.14.xxx and worked just fine in 1.12.xxx.\n\nIn 1.12.xxx the WebSocket Client is throwing an exception that can be handled. \nIn 1.12.xxx the ESP hangs! All parallel threads are hanging, too, the ESP is no longer doing anything.\n\n\n\n### How to reproduce\n\n 1. Create a small websocket server on a PC\n 2. Create a small websocket client on the ESP\n 3. Connect the client to the server and have it POST data every 1-3 seconds.\n 4. Stop the websocket server on the PC\n 5. The ESP hangs! No exception is fired, all parallel threads are hanging too\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nan Exception should be thrown if the server cannot be reached anymore.\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Sample project or code\n\nSetting up the client:\n```\nvoid SetupWS()\n{\n                //setup WebSocketClient\n                websocketClient = new ClientWebSocket(new ClientWebSocketOptions()\n                {\n                    //Change the heart beat to a 30 second interval\n                    KeepAliveInterval = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30),\n                    ServerTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(3)\n                });\n\n                //Handler for receiving websocket messages. \n                websocketClient.MessageReceived += WebsocketClient_MessageReceived;\n                websocketClient.ConnectionClosed += WebsocketClient_ConnectionClosed;\n                //Setup custom header\n                var headers = new ClientWebSocketHeaders();\n                headers[\"userId\"] = \"nano\";\n\n                websocketClient.Connect($\"ws://{SomeValidWSServer}/\", headers);\nwhile (1)\n{\n  Thread.Sleep(3000);\n WSRespondToHost(\"ping...\");\n}\n}\n        private void WebsocketClient_ConnectionClosed(object sender, EventArgs e)\n        {\n//THIS IS NEVER CALLED in FW 1.14.xxx but works fine in FW 1.12.xxx\n            Thread.Sleep(100);\n            SetupWebSockets();\n        }\n\n        private void WebsocketClient_MessageReceived(object sender, MessageReceivedEventArgs e)\n        {\n            try\n            {\n                if (!e.Frame.IsFragmented && e.Frame.MessageType == WebSocketMessageType.Text)\n                {\n                    Debug.WriteLine($\"-----> Recvd Bytes: {e.Frame.MessageLength}\");\n                }\n                else\n                {\n                    Debug.WriteLine(\"Fragmented messages are not allowed\");\n                }\n            }\n            catch (Exception ee)\n            {\n                Debug.WriteLine($\"Error in WS Message: {ee}\");\n            }\n        }\n\n        public void WSRespondToHost(string bytes)\n        {\n            if (websocketClient == null) return;\n           try\n           {\n                websocketClient.SendString(bytes);\n            }\n            catch (Exception e)\n             {\n//THIS IS NEVER CALLED in FW 1.14.xxx but works fine in FW 1.12.xxx\n                        Debug.WriteLine($\"POST to host excepted:\\n{e.Message}\");\n             }\n}\n```\n\n\n\n\n### Aditional information\n\n_No response_",

A couple of these search topics all relate to function calls available in Helm's template calls. tojson, b64enc, concat, haskey, trimsuffix and randalphanum all resolve to their function definitions, so that knocks a few off the list.\r\n\r\nif you search for \"image pull secrets\" instead of \"imagepullsecrets\", https://helm.sh/docs/howto/charts_tips_and_tricks/#creating-image-pull-secrets comes up. Is there a way to create aliases for search terms with algolia?\r\n\r\nFor \"atomic\", they're probably looking for documentation on the `--atomic` flag. A code search query on github only shows this as documentation for `helm help`. This looks like a good area to document: https://github.com/helm/helm-www/search?q=--atomic&unscoped_q=--atomic\r\n\r\nFor \"proxy\", I'm assuming they're referring to HTTP_PROXY or other related proxy setup environment variables, which may also be useful to document.\r\n\r\nNot sure what we can do about \"nameoverride\".\r\n\r\nAs for the other search terms, it looks like users are trying to look for information on specific charts.

They will continue trying to send data to your old port until that peer has announced to the tracker to get your new IP:Port. This could be 30 minutes or longer. Whilst it wouldn't be a big issue with a large swarm, it would impact torrents with a smaller swarm, and might have users complaining about slow speeds.\r\n\r\nI think this caveat should be stated in the docs, but the average user doesn't read docs, (All those guilty, say I \uD83D\uDE09) and may enable it regardless. My suggestion is to have a small note in the same style as the \"Automatically map port\" setting, pointing out that caveat below the option in the Network GUI.\r\n\r\n\"May impact download speeds in certain cases\"\n\n### Which application of Transmission?\n\nmacOS app\n\n### Which version of Transmission?\n\n4.0.0-dev (671f835228)",

Review the file to identify sections of code that are being ignored by Codecov or are not covered by tests.  \n2. Create or update test cases to ensure 100% coverage for the file.  \n3. Remove any `/* istanbul ignore */` or equivalent statements that bypass code coverage reporting, unless absolutely necessary.  \n\n# Resources  \n1. Refer to the foundational documentation on writing test cases in the repository.  \n1. Check the [Codecov report](https://app.codecov.io/gh/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa-admin/tree/develop?displayType=list) for details on the uncovered lines.  \n\n# Acceptance Criteria  \n1. All sections of the file are covered by tests.  \n1. Code coverage for the file reaches 100%.  \n1. PR created with necessary updates, passing all checks and reviews.\n1. All tests must be valid\n\n# If the file is not used in the code base:\n\n1. Remove the file and its test cases\n1. Submit a PR with the removed file(s) as the PR for this issue\n\n# Other\nIf you are new to testing, refer to [past test code coverage improvement PRs](https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa-admin/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Amerged%20in%3Atitle%20test%20) \n\n\n",

By default, clang does not build ClangIR support. You can find instructions for building with ClangIR enabled [here](https://llvm.github.io/clangir/GettingStarted/build-install.html).\n\nSecond, after building but before starting any other work, you should verify that you see an error when compiling the suggested minimal test case with ClangIR enabled. You should see an error (in this case, ``) when you compile the test case using the following options: `-fclangir -emit-cir`. The error may be followed by other errors or a stack dump. If you do not see an error, either someone else has already implemented this feature, or you are using the wrong repository (perhaps you built the ClangIR incubator repository?).\n\nThird, the code to implement this feature should be based on the classic codegen handling of the builtins. The task here is to find the correct code, copy it to the CIR/CodeGen/CIRGenBuiltinX86.cpp file, and update it to generate CIR instread of LLVM IR. As part of the migration process, you may need to update the code to conform to the coding standards used in CIR, which are slightly different from the usual clang standards (mostly, variable identifiers start with lowercase in CIR code). You will also need to create or migrate a LIT test that exercises the new code.\n\nDon't hesitate to ask for help if you need it. The entire point of \"good first issue\" is to help new people get involved with our project.\n", "@Thibault-Monnier @woruyu @HendrikHuebner @siddu0660 FYI", "@Priyanshu3820 It looks like @Thibault-Monnier has covered most of the builtins for https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/167752, but there is more work to be done here.\n\nIf we end up burning through all of these quickly, there are still many builtins to be handled for other targets." ],

Then if they use Brave or a similar browser that prompts them to allow legacy oauth, the page will refresh and they'll have to do that click through process again. This is a very frustration workflow for someone who just wants to see their calendar, and will result in drop-offs from existing users. \n\n### Solutions\n- [ ] Allow user to click through the initial onboarding screen (instead of having to wait until the screen text finishes rendering)\n- [ ] Add a Skip Intro button to the onboarding flow starting on the first page\n- [x] If a user already signed up, redirect them to the oauth page immediately (rather than loading the welcome screen)\n- [ ] Add a message telling users that they need to reauthenticate with google (in order to keep their account safe)\n- [x] Fix onboarding test `act` warnings\n\nImprove styes\n- [x] Next buttons\n\n### Use Case\n\nThis'll make it easier for newcomers to get started, and for existing users to keep using the app.\n\nMaking these steps cumbersome is leading to drop-offs in adoption\n\n### Additional Context\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\n**Add flag to the API response**\n- Differentiate between a user not being able to authenticate because\n  - They've never signed up\n  - They signed up, but their google access token is expired\n- Consider returning a 200-level response instead of a 401 depending on the above case",

I???d like to test the UI locally without actually calling the Gemini API, just to quickly check how the command text is displayed after `npm start`.  \n   However, it always triggers a real API call, and when tokens run out, it slows down the process a lot.\n\n2. I tried using React DevTools to trace which files correspond to each UI component, but it throws an error when launched (I???ve attached a screenshot).\n\n3. Currently, `Ctrl + D` already works as an exit command.  \n   Should I make it so that pressing `Ctrl + D` *once* during command execution shows the full command, or should I assign a different key?\n\n4. Should the key event be handled globally (like the existing `Ctrl + D` exit behavior) or locally inside  \n   `/packages/cli/src/ui/components/messages/ToolConfirmationMessage.tsx` ??? similar to how `'d'` is handled?\n\nI???d really appreciate any guidance or advice you can share to help me move forward.\nThank you.", "1. /auth gemini disable will prevent it from calling gemini. It shouldn't call gemini wtihout a prompt\n2. this is more sophisticated than my process. Haven't really used React DevTools\n3. CTRL-D was a suggestion - assign whatever you think a good key would be. maybe see what other tools might use and people might be familiar with\n4. That is a really interesting question. Which makes it most useful to you? However the point is for NON-confirmed tools. So if you're in yolo mode and its doing shell commands it truncates them with ... at the end. for Tool confirmation it expands it when you hit d. So maybe it will just turn off truncation and do expansion for all? Or maybe it will just be the tool that is currently running? I think doing it for all would be simpler --but you might need to limit to what is being displayed if you do (in case it tries to do EVERY tool ever in that session)" ],

We should additionally allow setting a pixel value. \n\n### Why?\n\nI had a few situations where I wanted a tiny gap of only a few pixels. `None` felt to small and `\"small\"` felt too big. \n\n### How?\n\nJust accept an integer in addition to the existing values, similar to `width` or `height` parameters we have elsewhere. \n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_",

      "comments" : [ "CC @ziqifan617 @kthui @tanmayv25 ", "Thanks for opening this issue ??? I???d be happy to help recreate the benchmarking guide.\n\nMy plan is to rebuild the documentation by referencing the old `examples/llm/benchmarks/README.md` as a baseline and aligning it with the current `benchmarks/llm` structure (including updated scripts like `perf.sh`, `plot_pareto.py`, and related examples). The goal is to make the new guide easier to follow for both local and multi-node benchmarking setups and to focus on the scripts currently located at `benchmarks/llm`.\n\nSince I don???t have access to multi-GPU or cluster hardware, I???ll be testing portions of the workflow locally on an Apple M1 Pro system. The initial draft will concentrate on verifying documentation accuracy, updating deprecated references (like old `dynamo serve` usage), and adding clear notes about hardware prerequisites, data paths, and script functionality (e.g., `perf.sh` options and expected outputs).\n\nAfter the first pass, I???ll request review specifically from maintainers familiar with the benchmarking workflow to confirm integration across supported backends (vLLM, TensorRT-LLM, etc.) and add notes for high-performance environments.\n\nDoes this plan sound aligned with what you???re expecting for this doc restoration?\n\n@rmccorm4 @hhzhang16 \n", "@AsadShahid04 this makes sense to me, would love to review! you can also use smth like brev.nvidia.com to test if it makes sense\n\ncc: @BenHamm @hhzhang16 who can also review with me", "Yup, sounds good to me too! Please tag me in any MRs, happy to review. Thanks for working on this!", "## Testing Update & Issue Found\n\nI've successfully restored the benchmarking guide and tested it on brev.dev. The documentation is working well, but I discovered an issue with the `perf.sh` script that affects the `plot_pareto.py` workflow.\n\n### Issue: Directory Structure Mismatch\n\n**Problem:** The `plot_pareto.py` script expects benchmark results to be organized in subdirectories like:\n`artifacts_0/`\n`-concurrency1/`\n`profile_export_aiperf.json`\n`-concurrency2/`\n`profile_export_aiperf.json`\n`...`\n\n\nHowever, when running `perf.sh` with multiple concurrency levels (e.g., `--concurrency 1,2,4,8`), AIPerf appears to be creating a single `profile_export_aiperf.json` file in the artifacts directory, overwriting previous results instead of creating separate subdirectories for each concurrency level.\n\n**What I observed:**\n- Running `bash benchmarks/llm/perf.sh --concurrency 1,2,4,8 ...` creates `artifacts_0/` with a single `profile_export_aiperf.json` file\n- The `plot_pareto.py` script fails with: `Exception: non-unique matches: []` because it can't find the expected `-concurrency<N>/` subdirectories\n\n\n**Possible causes:**\n1. AIPerf's output format may have changed and no longer creates subdirectories automatically\n2. The `perf.sh` script may need to be updated to manually create subdirectories for each concurrency level before calling AIPerf\n3. AIPerf may need a different flag or configuration to create per-concurrency subdirectories\n\n**Testing environment:**\n- Tested on brev.dev with Dynamo 0.7.0 (built from source)\n- AIPerf version: (`0.2.0`)\n- Model tested: Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B\n\nShould I:\n1. Investigate further and propose a fix to `perf.sh` to create the expected directory structure?\n2. Update the documentation to note this limitation?\n3. Both?\n\n@hhzhang16 @athreesh ", "Opened a bug for directory structure mismatch:\nhttps://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/issues/4233", "Opened a PR for review...but cannot test pareto graph until bug fix. WIll try opening a PR for pareto fix soon after confirmation!\n\nhttps://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/pull/4234", "> Investigate further and propose a fix to perf.sh to create the expected directory structure?\n\nI think this option would be best! There's a chance that things have changed following the switch to AIPerf that require changes in our scripts" ],

Before submitting, please verify the following: ??????\n\n- [X] This is a **bug**, not a question or a configuration issue.\n- [X] This issue is **not** already reported on Github (I've searched it).\n- [X] Nextcloud Server and Desktop Client are **up to date**. See [Server Maintenance and Release Schedule](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/wiki/Maintenance-and-Release-Schedule) and [Desktop Releases](https://nextcloud.com/install/#install-clients) for supported versions.\n- [X] I agree to follow Nextcloud's [Code of Conduct](https://nextcloud.com/contribute/code-of-conduct/)\n\n### Bug description\n\nOn the 3.14-macOS-vfs clients that we are using, we often see the exclamation mark icon on the status bar. Hovering on it, it says the vfs sync had an issue.\r\nHowever, opening the settings panel and clicking on \"Create debug archive\" freezes the UI and the Nextcloud process becomes unresponsive. This seems to be related (kind of a side effect) to the sync issue itself, because when the sync status is OK, it's possible to generate the debug archive without freezes.\r\n\r\nThe problem is, I have no clue on what the problem is and therefore haven't found a way to prevent/work around it.\r\n...\r\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Have the client running for at least some hours.\r\n2. The client shows an exclamation mark on the status bar, complaining the last sync had an issue.\r\n3. Open the settings panel and click on \"Create debug archive\"\r\n...\r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe debug archive should be created.\r\nObserved behaviour: the panel hangs and the process becomes unresponsive, I have to kill it.\r\nSeems similar to what happened a few versions back, on opening the settings panel, where the process froze and needed to be killed. \r\n...\r\n\n\n### Which files are affected by this bug\n\n-\n\n### Operating system\n\nmacOS\n\n### Which version of the operating system you are running.\n\nSonoma 14.6.1\n\n### Package\n\nOfficial macOS 12+ universal pkg\n\n### Nextcloud Server version\n\n29.0.6\n\n### Nextcloud Desktop Client version\n\n3.14.0-vfs\n\n### Is this bug present after an update or on a fresh install?\n\nUpdated from a minor version (ex. 3.4.2 to 3.4.4)\n\n### Are you using the Nextcloud Server Encryption module?\n\nEncryption is Disabled\n\n### Are you using an external user-backend?\n\n- [ ] Default internal user-backend\n- [ ] LDAP/ Active Directory\n- [ ] SSO - SAML\n- [ ] Other\n\n### Nextcloud Server logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional info\n\n_No response_",

Or we can simply create a new column (next to the status) for this information.

      "description" : "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\n\nThe idea is that all the providers get their own build tags. Say `go:aws` `go:gcp` `go:vault` etc.\n\nIn the register file in which we include all of them, we can also add their build tags.\n\nThis adds the ability that people who are very security focus can actually disable ALL the source code for a provider they don't want to use and actually only include the provider they DO want to use.\n\nSo a build could be created in which only the code is included that lets you deal with AWS provider. This further strengthens the security posture of ESO because other providers couldn't bleed into the only providers being used by the user.\n\n**Note**: ESO would ALWAYS build ALL of the providers. This is strictly a user operated feature. If users would like to opt-out from providers they need to build their own ESO with the right build flags.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nA clear and concise description of what you want to happen.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nA clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.\n\n**Additional context**\nAdd any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.\n",

      "description" : "###  Avoid nested ternary operators\n\nIt would be great if we cold avoid using Nested Ternary Operators in this repo. It seems the pattern has been used in different places which may motivate developers to use it again. \n\n# Reason\n\nNested ternary operators are generally considered a suboptimal coding practice because they significantly reduce code readability and maintainability. While the ternary operator is designed as a concise substitute for simple if-else statements, nesting them multiple times (e.g., a ? b : c ? d : e) quickly creates a complex and confusing structure that is difficult for developers to parse visually and logically. This ambiguity can lead to errors, as the operator precedence might not be immediately clear to someone other than the original author. For this reason, using clear, multi-line if-else if-else statements or a switch statement is strongly recommended when dealing with multiple conditions, prioritizing clarity over brevity to ensure the code remains understandable and easier to debug.\n\n\n# Solution\n\n- Add the proper ESLINT config. After this the ESLINT validation would fail, so you could spot the defected blocks. \n- Simply fix them all\n",

      "description" : "### Overview\n\nWhat is the problem we're solving? For very simple items, this can be encapsulated in the success criteria.\n\nEIA form 191 contains valuable information about working and base gas in reservoirs, injections, withdrawals, and location of reservoirs reported by operators of all underground natural gas storage fields on a monthly basis. Let's bring this data into PUDL!\n\n### Precursors\nWhat do we need to do before we can start work on this issue?\n\n- [ ] #4755 \n\n### Success Criteria\n\nThere is no one size fits all in table transforms, though we document our approach to cleaning data [here](https://catalystcoop-pudl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/data_guidelines.html#examples-of-acceptable-changes).\n\nThe new table should meet the following criteria:\n* a well defined and unique primary key: one or more columns that naturally explain what a row in the table corresponds to. For this table, this _should_ be one row per year and ID. You'll need to check that the combination of these fields is unique, and in the case of duplications, propose a strategy for creating a unique primary key.\n* all categorical columns should be constrained (e.g., the state column shouldn't contain \"New York City\" in it).\n* nulls should be standardized\n* units should be standardized\n* data types should be defined and enforced\n* metadata should be added to the database schema for each new field and for the table itself\n* data should be validated in DBT\n\n### Transform the data\n- [ ] Make a copy of `devtools/inspect-assets.ipynb`. Use the notebook to load the `raw_eia191__data` asset and inspect it. This asset contains all years of the table extracted and concatenated together.\n- [ ] In the notebook, explore the table and transform it. Here are some docs re [standard pudl transforms](https://catalystcoop-pudl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/data_guidelines.html#examples-of-acceptable-changes).\n    - [ ] Make sure there are no non-standard nulls (e.g., \"-\"). If there are, replace them with `pd.NA`.\n    - [ ] Check for primary keys of the table and drop if there are **clear** errors (ex: duplicates on expected PKs but with clear bad records aka one decent looking record and one with mostly nulls).\n    - [ ] Handle unexpected dtypes: e.g., no numbers in the state column\n    - [ ] Convert the `operating_state` column to well-behaved state subdivision codes (e.g., Alaska to AK). Do this by mapping the existing state names against `core_pudl__codes_subdivisions`, cleaning up strings as is needed. We'll need to decide how to handle the non-state values (e.g., Mexico, other) reported for correction records.\n    - [ ] Clean up column names as needed to create succinct but informative variable names.\n    - [ ] Convert the month and the date columns to one combined `report_date` column using `pudl.helpers.convert_to_date()`\n\n#### Bring the tables into PUDL's ETL\n- [ ] Once you're satisfied with the table, it's time to bring it into dagster.\n   - [ ] In `pudl/src/pudl/transform/eia191.py` add a new `core` asset function based on [asset naming conventions](https://catalystcoop-pudl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/naming_conventions.html#asset-naming-conventions). In this case: `core_eia191__monthly_gas_storage`\n   - [ ] add the `@asset()` decorator to this function.\n   - [ ] Migrate your transforms for the notebook into this function.\n   - [ ] [Reload the code location in dagster](https://catalystcoop-pudl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/dev_dagster.html#reloading-code-locations), search for your new table in the \"Asset\" tab and materialize it. See [our docs on Dagster](https://catalystcoop-pudl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/dev_dagster.html) for support.\n- [ ] **Checkpoint:** Before you press on to the next set of tasks, get a review from a Catalyst developer.\n- [ ] Add metadata for this table to add this table to the database schema\n   - [ ] define the table  in `pudl/src/metadata/resources/eia191.py`\n       - [ ] define the fields (aka column names)\n       - [ ] add primary keys if possible\n       - [ ] add `\"field_namespace\": \"eia\",`\n       - [ ] add `\"sources\": [\"eia191\"],`\n       - [ ] add `\"etl_group\": \"eia191\",`\n       - [ ] consult with a Catalyst developer about how to update table documentation\n    - [ ] Go add any new fields into `pudl/src/pudl/metadata/fields.py`\n       - [ ] check that each field doesn't already exist.\n       - [ ] add a description for each field.\n       - [ ] add the data type\n       - [ ] add constraints (enums/categories or patterns) if relevant.\n       - [ ] add units\n- [ ] **Checkpoint:** Before you press on to the next set of tasks, get a review from a Catalyst developer.\n- [ ] Write the table to the PUDL database\n   - [ ] Add the io manager to the asset() decorator: `@asset(io_manager_key=\"pudl_io_manager\")`\n   - [ ] [update alembic schema](https://catalystcoop-pudl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/run_the_etl.html#database-schema-migration)\n- [ ] Materialize your table via the [dagster ui](https://catalystcoop-pudl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/run_the_etl.html#running-the-etl-via-the-dagster-ui)\n- [ ] Add a table schema in [dbt](https://catalystcoop-pudl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/data_validation_reference.html#adding-new-tables) and add [expected row counts](https://catalystcoop-pudl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/data_validation_quickstart.html#row-counts)\n- [ ] Add any other DBT tests that seem sensible (e.g., volume can't be negative).

This would enable LLMs or external planners to dynamically compose and orchestrate robot behaviors from existing action primitives.\n\n### Motivation\nBehavior trees (BTs) provide a robust and modular structure for sequencing and prioritizing robot tasks.\nWith ROS Actions already accessible through MCP, we can use BTs as the planning and execution layer that composes these atomic skills into complex, explainable behaviors. This approach aligns well with ongoing research in skills composition and would make the MCP???ROS bridge far more expressive and reusable across tasks and platforms.\n\n### Proposed Tasks\n\n#### Define MCP Tool Schema for BT creation and execution, e.g.:\n```\n{\n  \"name\": \"execute_behavior_tree\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"tree_definition\": \"string (XML or JSON)\",\n    \"context\": \"object (optional task/environment data)\"\n  }\n}\n```\n#### Add a Behavior Tree Manager in ros_mcp_server that:\n\n- Parses and executes BT definitions using py_trees or BehaviorTree.CPP.\n- Connects leaf nodes to existing ROS Actions or Services.\n- Streams BT status updates back to MCP.\n\n### Demo:\n#### Example:  Pick-and-place pipeline composed of:\n- NavigateToPose\n- PickObject\n- PlaceObject\n#### LLM generates or modifies BT structure based on high-level commands.\n#### (Optional) Explore integration with Claude Skills as a conceptual reference for structured, declarative skill graphs.",

I can also share the proposed functions for both the manager and the server here before opening a PR. \n\nWould it make sense to create an experimental `behaviour_tree` branch for the same? \n\nThanks,\nBharat", "@itsbharatj thanks for your message!\n\nQuick question, does your approach use ROS-related BT libraries/packages, or is it implemented as a standalone?\n\nMy reasoning is:\n\n- If it???s meant to interface with Behavior Trees running within ROS (e.g., using a ROS BT package), it might make sense to integrate the functionality within the `ros-mcp-server`.\n\n- If it???s meant to be independent (e.g., using PyTrees or another generic BT library that can connect to ROS or other consumers), then a separate `bt-mcp-server` would be the cleaner approach.\n\nI???m currently debating whether we should integrate the BT features directly into the ros-mcp-server or develop a separate bt-mcp-server. Personally, I???m leaning toward a separate MCP server for Behavior Trees, where the LLM acts as the glue agent, coordinating between ROS and BT. The BT server would expose tools like list_trees, load_tree, start/stop/tick, status/inspect, and set_blackboard/get_blackboard. The ROS and BT servers could interoperate through the LLM client (using respective tool namespaces) or via a thin coordinator layer if needed (possibly through Claude Skills). \n\nHowever, this decision is open for discussion and suggestions. Depending on the approach we decide to use, I???ll either create a feature branch on `ros-mcp-server` (if tied to ROS BT packages) or scaffold a new `bt-mcp-server` repository (if independent).", "Found a few options out there, to not reinvent the wheel!\n\nhttps://github.com/qcr/ros_trees/tree/ros2\n\nhttps://github.com/splintered-reality/py_trees_ros", "Hey @stex2005, thanks for your elaborate comment and reasoning. \n\n> does your approach use ROS-related BT libraries/packages, or is it implemented as a standalone?\n\nBased on my understanding if we are incorporating ROS actions we would require ROS dependencies. However, the `BT_Manager` would be standalone as an template to read the `JSON` and `XML` generated by the LLM based on the requirement of the task (and the available ROS actions) and tool to verify and debug for any inconsistencies in the files. \n\nOne of the things I noticed based on my initially testing was that given a specific goal for example `Move a turtle in a circle` the LLM did not utilise the BT planning tool until stated very explicitly. I'm not sure if you would have faced something similar while building multiple tools into the functions. \n\nI think you're right on creating a different server in the beginning to test `behaviour_trees` along with integrating some essential tools from `server.py`. If it works well, we can try integrating it together and testing it.\n\n> Found a few options out there, to not reinvent the wheel!\n\nThanks for sharing these links, I think if they work well it can help abstract a lot of things. \n", "> Based on my understanding if we are incorporating ROS actions we would require ROS dependencies.

For instance, ask drawing a letter with the turtle sim and the LLM will fail. \n\n> I think you're right on creating a different server in the beginning to test `behaviour_trees` along with integrating some essential tools from `server.py`.

I don't know.", "If you select one of the 74245 components and set its \"Show the internal structure\" attribute to \"Yes\", you will see that this [bidirectional bus transceiver](https://www.alldatasheet.com/datasheet-pdf/view/51058/FAIRCHILD/74245.html) has tristate buffers, which are controlled by the DIR and ENABLE inputs. The observed behaviour is aligned to the data sheet and shown internal structure. I am therefore closing this issue as invalid.", "I think there might be a misunderstanding, the problem isn't with the logic but rather that the chip doesn't update when using DIP switches, I might have implemented it wrong but the point with uploading the circuit was to show how I'm wiring the DIP switches to the TTLs, also @MinekPo1 seems to be able to replicate the issue", "OK, I can now reproduce the non-propagation. I somehow managed to overlook it in my initial test with the `issue_2388.circ` provided by @MinekPo1. Still, I cannot find an obvious cause for that issue in `src/main/java/com/cburch/logisim/std/ttl/Ttl74245.java`. @davidhutchens or @BFH-ktt1, could you maybe have a look what is going on? ", "I have given this a brief look using a debugger. It seems that the simulator upgrade has optimized CircuitState so that when a value is changed on a port, it only marks the component dirty if the port is an input port. Thus the component's propagate() method is never called when it is an output port.\n\nMaking the change suggested by @MinekPo1 causes the simulator to mark the component dirty when the value changes on the port so it works as expected.\n\nI note that the component seems to read or write to any port regardless of its input/output status!\n\nI want to think about this and test some more before trying to fix it.", "I suspect those ports should actually be declared INOUT, but AbstractTtlGate does not provide that option. The proper fix may be to add that capability there.", "I have a working solution adding INOUT to AbstractTtlGate and using it in TTL74245. It still needs clean up and testing.", "Thanks @davidhutchens for looking at this issue so quickly and finding a fix! I hope that change all pins to INOUT has no unwanted side effects with the other TTL gates, e.g., regarding the displayed tooltips when hovering over the pins. I am looking forward to your PR!\n\nI'm always surprised how popular the TTL components still are among our users. @MinekPo1 and @Mani4D46: It would be great if you could test @davidhutchens fix with your TTL design once it becomes available. ", "@maehne: I am not changing all OUTPUT ports to INOUT. I am adding a constructor parameter to pass INOUT ports as well as the other kinds. So it should not change the behavior of any other TTL implementations. I will add a ToolTip string for the INOUT ports.\n\nHowever, there may be (likely are?) other TTLs that should have some of their ports changed from OUTPUT to INOUT. I'm not sure how to look for those. Would @Mani4D46 or @MinekPo1 have any suggestions about where or how to look?", "I'm afraid my usage of TTL components is basically limited to this issue, but just from names and `grep`ing for keywords I couldn't find any other components which this could apply to, but that's not very conclusive.\n\nWriting a quick script to scan all the TTL implementations for pins which are set and read from could be a bit more conclusive, but that could also be fooled.\n\nEdit: tried writing the aforementioned script, but turns out the code base is a bit more complicated than I thought, but for the low hanging fruit that my script was able to understand only Ttl7164 calls `getPortValue` with a output port as a param, and that seems to be okay?

For this work, I'll ignore it since its behavior has not changed. `data.pullDown` is not relevant to this issue. This is a shift register and that method does the shift on the data.\n\nSo at this time, we have just one file that should be using INOUT. I'll proceed with the clean up and testing.

However, I hit a wall when migrating my custom Pinecone integration with Symfony Store. \nThe problem is that it expects the vector document ID (coming from Pinecone) to be in `UUID` format, in my case, it is not. All the information is already stored in Pinecone with a different ID format, so I can't use it to query my database (I get an `InvalidArgumentException`). \nIt would be great to add a way to overcome this. Perhaps the `VectorDocument` id could support `strings`, or is there a reason it must be a `UUID`?\n\nThis is the chunk of code I'm referring to: https://github.com/symfony/ai/blob/main/src/store/src/Bridge/Pinecone/Store.php#L71-L78\n\nThanks in advance!",

I've updated the label from `bug` to `enhancement` to reflect this.\n\n---\n*I'm an [AI assistant](https://github.com/danielchalmers/AutoTriage) ??? If I missed something or made a mistake, please let me know in a reply!*\n\n<!--\n**Triage Summary: MudTextField ErrorText Binding Issue**\nOkay, so I've got this `MudTextField` issue to look at, and it seems straightforward.  `persidef` is reporting that the `@bind-ErrorText` isn't working as expected.  They've given a reproduction link, which is always helpful.  `ScarletKuro`, a maintainer, already weighed in and confirmed my initial hunch ??? it's not a bug *per se*, but a missing piece of functionality. Specifically, the `ErrorText` parameter doesn't have an `ErrorTextChanged` event callback, which is what's needed for two-way binding.\nBased on that, I'm thinking we need to shift the label from `bug` to `enhancement`. The code isn't *broken*; it just doesn't do what the user *wants* it to do in this binding scenario.  `ScarletKuro`'s comment really nails it down, pointing directly to the missing line of code that needs to be added.  This makes it a perfect candidate for a \"good first issue\", too - it's well-defined, and the reproduction is solid.\nMy plan is to update the labels and post a clarifying comment explaining the change from `bug` to `enhancement`, directly citing `ScarletKuro`'s analysis. The title is fine as is. I'll also add a \"good first issue\" label to signal that this is an approachable task for a new contributor. I think this will steer the conversation correctly and get this issue moving in the right direction. It's a clean, actionable task.\n-->" ],

(Please write the *exact* version, example: 10.1.0)\n\n~~12.3.0+ (but applies to any version)~~\nv16 (latest)\n\n### Bug summary\n\nThere are thousands of warnings within the Umbraco source code. I was hoping to try and start to reduce these as use this issue as a base to work from (unless there already is one?).\n\nMy idea is to go through each project and check that there are no warnings, and if there are, remove them. \n\nThis is until perhaps we can set warnings as errors to keep it clean for future? Bigger step/decision! I have started an initial PR for this at #15019.\n\n### Specifics\n\nI recommend ticking off each project if there are no warnings, or if all warnings have since been removed. \nTo maintain this, we would also set warnings as errors (something for HQ to consider)\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Open IDE of choice\n2. Build\n3. Observe warnings\n\n### Expected result / actual result\n\nMinimal to no warnings ultimately\n```[tasklist]\n### Tasks\n- [x] Remove warnings from Templates/Umbraco.Templates project\n- [ ] Remove warnings from Tests/Umbraco.TestData project\n- [x] Remove warnings from Tests/Umbraco.Tests.AcceptanceTest.UmbracoProject project\n- [x] Remove warnings from Tests/Umbraco.Tests.AcceptanceTest project\n- [ ] Remove warnings from Tests/Umbraco.Tests.Benchmarks project\n- [x] Remove warnings from Tests/Umbraco.Tests.Common project\n- [ ] Remove warnings from Tests/Umbraco.Tests.Integration project\n- [ ] Remove warnings from Tests/Umbraco.Tests.UnitTests project\n- [x] Remove warnings from Tools/Umbraco.JsonSchema project\n- [x] Remove warnings from Umbraco.Cms project\n- [ ] Remove warnings from Umbraco.Cms.Api.Common project\n- [ ] Remove warnings from Umbraco.Cms.Api.Delivery project\n- [ ] Remove warnings from Umbraco.Cms.Api.Management project\n- [x] Remove warnings from Umbraco.Cms.Imaging.ImageSharp project\n- [x] Remove warnings from Umbraco.Cms.Imaging.ImageSharp2 project\n- [ ] Remove warnings from Umbraco.Cms.Persistence.EFCore project\n- [x] Remove warnings from Umbraco.Cms.Persistence.EFCore.SqlServer project\n- [x] Remove warnings from Umbraco.Cms.Persistence.EFCore.Sqlite project\n- [ ] Remove warnings from Umbraco.Cms.Persistence.SqlServer project\n- [ ] Remove warnings from Umbraco.Cms.Persistence.Sqlite project\n- [x] Remove warnings from Umbraco.Cms.StaticAssets project\n- [ ] Remove warnings from Umbraco.Cms.Targets project\n- [ ] Remove warnings from Umbraco.Core project\n- [ ] Remove warnings from Umbraco.Examine.Lucene project\n- [ ] Remove warnings from Umbraco.Infrastructure project\n- [ ] Remove warnings from Umbraco.PublishedCache.HybridCache project\n- [ ] Remove warnings from Umbraco.Web.Common project\n- [ ] Remove warnings from Umbraco.Web.UI project\n- [x] Remove warnings from Umbraco.Web.UI.Client project\n- [x] Remove warnings from Umbraco.Web.UI.Login project\n- [ ] Remove warnings from Umbraco.Web.Website project\n```",

We are making progress though and in the meantime, we will keep you in the loop and let you know when we have any questions.\n\nThanks, from your friendly Umbraco GitHub bot :robot: :slightly_smiling_face:", "Hi @emmagarland,\n\nWe're writing to let you know that we would love some help with this issue.

Various packages stopped updating due to checkver errors.\nSee: https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Extras/actions/runs/18627830520/job/53108310389\n\nContributors are warmly welcome to help fix one or more of these broken manifest. Please note:\n- Make sure there are no existing fix PRs.\n- Create a separate PR or a separate commit for each manifest, with a title following the naming rules.\n- Please do not attempt to close this issue in your PR.\n- For manifests that are still available but will no longer receive updates, remove their checkver fields instead of deprecating them.\n- For autoupdate filed, if we can still install a specific version via `scoop install app@version` (i.e., autoupdate is version-specific), removing it is also not recommended. https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Extras/pull/16392#issuecomment-3438955656\n> IMO, if we keep the autoupdate field, users can still install a specific version via `scoop install app@version`. Otherwise:\n> ```\n> PS> scoop install fbflipper@0.238.0\n> WARN  Given version (0.238.0) does not match manifest (0.239.0)\n> WARN  Attempting to generate manifest for 'fbflipper' (0.238.0)\n> 'fbflipper' does not have autoupdate capability\n> ```\n> P.S. If https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Scoop/pull/6370 gets merged, this will no longer be necessary and can be removed later.\n\n### Package List\nHere are all the packages stopped updating due to checkver errors.\n\nThis result was obtained using a simple matching script and may contain false positives.\n\n- [ ] adventuregamestudio: #16436 \n- [ ] anaconda3\n- [x] anki: #16115\n- [x] anythingllm: #16385 \n- [ ] authy: #16386 \n- [x] autohotkey: #16384\n- [ ] b1\n- [ ] basecamp\n- [x] betaflight-blackbox-explorer: #16387\n- [x] biblioteq: #16394 \n- [ ] bitmessage\n- [ ] capframex\n- [ ] ccleaner\n- [ ] chef-workstation: #16071 #16383\n- [ ] cider: #16388\n- [x] classic-volume-mixer: #16382\n- [x] clementine: #16381\n- [x] color-sustainer: #16380\n- [x] compactgui: #16378\n- [x] cookiecutter: #16377\n- [ ] ctypes\n- [x] debugtron: #16376\n- [x] debugviewpp: #16375\n- [ ] dreamset: #16389 \n- [x] duplicati: #16374\n- [x] eclipse-mat: #15977\n- [ ] eclipse-parallel: #16390 \n- [ ] engauge-digitizer: #16391 \n- [x] executor: #16410\n- [ ] falkon\n- [x] fbflipper: #16392 \n- [ ] firemin: #16355\n- [ ] fluidsynth: #16455\n- [ ] folding-at-home: #16405\n- [x] folo: #16432\n- [ ] fvim: #16373\n- [ ] gatling\n- [x] gpu-z: #16413\n- [x] grafana: #16396\n- [ ] hekasoft-backup-restore\n- [x] http-downloader: #16467 \n- [ ] hwinfo: #16366\n- [ ] icechat\n- [ ] ida-free\n- [ ] imdone\n- [ ] imo-messenger\n- [ ] interlink\n- [ ] ios-webkit-debug-proxy\n- [ ] jasper\n- [ ] jaspersoft-studio\n- [x] jetbrains-hub: #16406\n- [ ] kawaii-player\n- [ ] kmeans-colors\n- [x] kodi: #16456\n- [ ] libresprite\n- [ ] linkerd\n- [ ] liteide\n- [ ] live777\n- [ ] ludwig\n- [ ] madvr: #16412\n- [ ] mambaforge\n- [ ] mc: #16409\n- [ ] meshroom: #16462\n- [ ] micaforeveryone\n- [ ] miru\n- [ ] moosync\n- [ ] mqttx: #16417\n- [ ] msikombustor\n- [ ] ncftpclient\n- [x] nexus-repository-oss: [c630f00](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Extras/commit/c630f004ffb8a52730ddc3210d5100ac45ceae1f)\n- [ ] olive-editor: Nvm.

For example, you cannot open the dropdown with the keyboard at the moment.", "@sfc-gh-nbellante \n\njust to confirm my understanding:\n\nThe original issue around updating the dropdown visuals appears to be mostly a CSS / styling change (matching the new top-nav dropdown style).\n\nThe a11y improvement you mentioned ??? like enabling opening the dropdown via keyboard ??? would likely involve logic changes at the component or backend interaction level, beyond just styling.\n\nSince I'm just starting out, would it make sense for me to first focus on the styling update as the base fix, and then create a follow-up issue or PR for the keyboard-accessibility enhancement?\nOr would you prefer both to be handled together within the same PR?", "Hey @rishi-kumar0612! \n\nI want to clarify the scope of this issue, as it's actually more involved than it might initially appear.\n\n**What needs to be done**\n\n  The goal is to update the dropdown menus used by several widgets to match the visual style of the new top navigation dropdown. The widgets that need updating include:\n\n  - st.selectbox - https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/develop/frontend/lib/src/components/shared/Dropdown/Selectbox.tsx\n  - st.multiselect - https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/develop/frontend/lib/src/components/widgets/Multiselect/Multiselect.tsx\n  - st.time_input - https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/develop/frontend/lib/src/components/widgets/TimeInput/TimeInput.tsx\n  - st.dataframe column filters (uses the shared Dropdown component)\n  - App menu dropdowns\n\n  **The target style**\n\n  The new dropdown style you want to match is implemented in the top navigation's dropdown menu:\n  - TopNavSection component:\n  https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/develop/frontend/app/src/components/Navigation/TopNavSection.tsx#L77-L193\n  - Styled components:\n  https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/develop/frontend/app/src/components/Navigation/styled-components.ts#L323-L330\n\nNote that the top nav dropdown uses BaseWeb's Popover component (lines 77-193) with custom styling overrides, including the rounded corners (theme.radii.xl), specific shadows, and borders.\n\n  **Why this is more than just CSS**\n\nThe current widgets use BaseWeb's Select component, which has its own dropdown implementation. To match the top nav style, you'll likely need to override the Dropdown component prop in the Select's overrides (similar to how VirtualDropdown is used at https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/develop/frontend/lib/src/components/shared/Dropdown/Selectbox.tsx#L174) and apply the new styling to match the StyledPopoverContent from the top nav.\n\nThe key styling changes to replicate are:\n  - Border radius: theme.radii.xl (all corners)\n  - Box shadow: conditional based on light/dark theme\n  - Border styling: consistent 1px solid borders\n  - Padding: theme.spacing.twoXS vertical, 0 horizontal\n  - Margins: specific top/right spacing\n\n**About my earlier a11y comment**\n\nAfter thinking through the implementation more carefully, I realize my earlier comment about keyboard accessibility isn't actually relevant to this issue. The widgets you'd be updating (st.selectbox, st.multiselect, etc.) already have proper keyboard support through BaseWeb's Select component, and updating the visual styling won't affect that. So you can disregard that concern???it's not applicable here.\n\n**Recommendation**\n\nGiven that this involves:\n  1. Updating multiple widget components across the codebase\n  2. Understanding BaseWeb's override system and Emotion styling\n  3. Creating custom dropdown components or overrides\n  4. Testing changes across all affected widgets\n\nThis is actually a moderate-to-advanced level contribution, not quite a \"good first issue\" in practice. However, if you're comfortable with React, TypeScript, and Emotion, it could be a great learning opportunity!\n\nI'd suggest starting with just st.selectbox as a proof of concept, then we can review that approach before rolling it out to the other widgets. This way you get feedback early and avoid having to rework multiple components.\n\nDoes this help clarify the scope? Let me know if you have questions about the approach!", "Hey @sfc-gh-nbellante !\n\nThanks so much for the detailed breakdown???this really helps clarify the scope.\n\nI understand this is more involved than a typical \"good first issue,\" but I'm comfortable with React, TypeScript, and Emotion, so I'm up for the challenge!\n\nYour suggestion to start with st.selectbox as a proof of concept makes perfect sense. I'll focus on that first and get it working before expanding to the other widgets.\n\nMy plan:\n\n- Study the TopNavSection.tsx and its styled components to understand the target style\n- Modify Selectbox.tsx (or VirtualDropdown) to match the new dropdown styling\n- Test thoroughly with a sample script\n- Open a draft PR for early feedback before rolling out to other widgets\n\nI'll start working on this and reach out if I hit any blockers. Should I ping you here when I have the st.selectbox proof of concept ready for review?\n\n\nThanks again for the guidance!", "Hey @sfc-gh-nbellante and @jrieke! \n\nI've created a draft PR implementing the new dropdown styling for `st.selectbox` as discussed: #13004 \n\nAs suggested, I started with just the selectbox as a proof of concept. The changes include:\n- ??? Rounded corners (`theme.radii.xl`) matching TopNav\n- ??? Conditional shadows for light/dark themes\n- ??? Consistent 1px borders\n- ??? Proper padding structure\n\nAll tests pass and I've verified the styling matches the top navigation dropdown. Ready for review!\n\nOnce this approach is approved, I can roll out the same changes to `st.multiselect`, `st.time_input`, and the other dropdowns mentioned.\n" ],

      "repositoryName" : "OWASP-BLT/BLT",
      "description" : "To integrate the `flutter_appavailability` package into your app, you can follow these steps:\r\n1. Add the `flutter_appavailability` package to your project by adding the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:\r\n```<span>yaml\r\ndependencies:\r\n  flutter_appavailability: ^0.5.2+1\r\n\r\n```\r\n1. Import the package in your Dart file where you want to use it:\r\n```<span>python\r\nimport 'package:flutter_appavailability/flutter_appavailability.dart';\r\n\r\n```\r\n1. Use the `getInstalledApps()` method to get a list of installed apps on the device:\r\n```<span>scss\r\nList&lt;Application&gt; installedApps = [];\r\n\r\nvoid getInstalledApps() async {\r\n  List&lt;Application&gt; apps = await AppAvailability.getInstalledApps();\r\n  setState(() {\r\n    installedApps = apps;\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\nIn this example, we're using the `getInstalledApps()` method from the `flutter_appavailability` package to get a list of all installed apps on the device. The `getInstalledApps()` method returns a `List&lt;Application&gt;` object containing information about each installed app, such as the app name, package name, and icon.\r\n1. Display the list of installed apps in your app's UI.\r\n```<span>less\r\nListView.builder(\r\n  itemCount: installedApps.length,\r\n  itemBuilder: (context, index) {\r\n    return ListTile(\r\n      leading: CircleAvatar(\r\n        backgroundImage: MemoryImage(installedApps[index].icon),\r\n      ),\r\n      title: Text(installedApps[index].appName),\r\n      subtitle: Text(installedApps[index].packageName),\r\n    );\r\n  },\r\n)\r\n\r\n```\r\nIn this example, we're using a `ListView.builder` widget to display the list of installed apps in a scrollable list. Each app is displayed as a `ListTile` widget, with the app icon, name, and package name shown.\r\n1. Use the installed app list when reporting an issue.\r\nYou can use the installed app list to provide additional information when reporting an issue in your app. For example, you could ask the user to select the app they were using when the issue occurred, and include this information in the bug report.\r\nNote that the `getInstalledApps()` method can take a long time to complete on devices with many installed apps, so you should consider using a loading indicator while the list is being fetched.\r\n",

Create an autocomplete widget for the URL field in the bug report screen\n3. Store both the app name and package ID when selected\n4. Handle platform differences between Android and iOS\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\nFirst, let's update the pubspec.yaml file to add the necessary dependency:\n\n```yaml\n# Add this to pubspec.yaml under dependencies:\n  installed_apps: ^1.3.1\n```\n\nNow, let's modify the report_bug.dart file to implement the autocomplete widget:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:installed_apps/app_info.dart';\nimport 'package:installed_apps/installed_apps.dart';\n\n// Inside _ReportFormState class:\n\n// Add these variables\nList<AppInfo> _installedApps = [];\nString? _selectedAppPackage;\nbool _isLoadingApps = false;\n\n@override\nvoid initState() {\n  super.initState();\n  _checkStatus();\n  getAvailableLabels();\n  if (widget.reportPageDefaults.sharedMediaFile != null) {\n    _image = [File(widget.reportPageDefaults.sharedMediaFile!.path)];\n  }\n  if (widget.reportPageDefaults.text != null) {\n    _titleController.text = widget.reportPageDefaults.text!;\n  }\n  if (widget.company != null &&\n      widget.company?.url != null &&\n      widget.company?.url != \"\") {\n    _titleController.text = widget.company!.url!;\n  }\n  addFocusListener();\n  _loadInstalledApps(); // Add this line to load apps on init\n}\n\n// Add this new method to load installed apps\nFuture<void> _loadInstalledApps() async {\n  setState(() {\n    _isLoadingApps = true;\n  });\n  \n  try {\n    if (Platform.isAndroid) {\n      final apps = await InstalledApps.getInstalledApps(true, true);\n      setState(() {\n        _installedApps = apps;\n        _isLoadingApps = false;\n      });\n    } else {\n      // iOS doesn't support listing all installed apps due to system restrictions\n      setState(() {\n        _installedApps = [];\n        _isLoadingApps = false;\n      });\n    }\n  } catch (e) {\n    print('Error loading installed apps: $e');\n    setState(() {\n      _isLoadingApps = false;\n    });\n  }\n}\n\n// Replace the TextFormField in the build method with this Autocomplete widget:\n// Find the TextFormField with controller: _titleController and replace it with:\n\nAutocomplete<AppInfo>(\n  optionsBuilder: (TextEditingValue textEditingValue) {\n    if (textEditingValue.text.isEmpty) {\n      return const Iterable<AppInfo>.empty();\n    }\n    \n    return _installedApps.where((AppInfo app) {\n      return app.name.toLowerCase().contains(textEditingValue.text.toLowerCase()) ||\n             app.packageName.toLowerCase().contains(textEditingValue.text.toLowerCase());\n    }).take(5); // Limit to 5 suggestions for performance\n  },\n  displayStringForOption: (AppInfo app) => app.name,\n  fieldViewBuilder: (\n    BuildContext context,\n    TextEditingController fieldController,\n    FocusNode fieldFocusNode,\n    VoidCallback onFieldSubmitted,\n  ) {\n    // Sync our internal controller with the field controller\n    if (_titleController.text.isNotEmpty && fieldController.text.isEmpty) {\n      fieldController.text = _titleController.text;\n    }\n    \n    return TextFormField(\n      controller: fieldController,\n      focusNode: fieldFocusNode,\n      validator: (value) {\n        if (value == null || value.isEmpty) {\n          return AppLocalizations.of(context)!.requiredField;\n        }\n        return null;\n      },\n      onChanged: (v) {\n        _titleController.text = v; // Keep our controller in sync\n        if (duplicateVerified) {\n          setState(() {\n            duplicateVerified = false;\n          });\n        }\n        _selectedAppPackage = null; // Reset package if text is changed\n      },\n      decoration: InputDecoration(\n        hintText: (fieldFocusNode.hasFocus)\n            ?

Uses the installed_apps package to get a list of installed apps on Android\n2. Creates an autocomplete widget that shows app icons, names, and package IDs\n3. Stores both the app name (visible in the text field) and package ID (hidden)\n4. Handles platform differences (showing app list only on Android as iOS has restrictions)\n\nThe autocomplete works for both manual entry and selecting from installed apps, maintaining the existing functionality while adding the new feature.", "Hi @DonnieBLT \uD83D\uDC4B\nI???m Husain, currently exploring the OWASP-BLT project and planning to contribute toward GSoC 2026.\nI came across this issue and would like to work on integrating the flutter_appavailability package.\nCould you please confirm if I can take this up?", "There is a related PR you can take a look and see to test it out and confirm that it works" ],

Setup dart proxy listening on port 8080 with the `web_dev_config.yaml` in the root of project with content : \n```\nserver:\n  port: 8080\n  proxy:\n    - target: \"http://localhost:5000\"\n      regex: \"^/login\"\n```\n3. Run a upstream http server (listening port 5000 here) : `$ python -m http.server 5000`\n4. Run the flutter project with flutter run -d web-server\n5. Request the proxy with a matching regex and query string `$ curl http://localhost:8080/login?foo=bar` or use code sample below and click to the middle button \n6. Check logs of the upstream webserver \nReproduced with channel master + beta\n\n### Expected results\n\nUpstream server get request with query string. e.g :\n\n`127.0.0.1 - - [07/Nov/2025 10:29:07] \"GET /login?foo=bar HTTP/1.1\" 404 -`\n\n### Actual results\n\nUpstream server does not receive query string\n\n`127.0.0.1 - - [07/Nov/2025 10:31:04] \"GET /login HTTP/1.1\" 404 -`\n\n### Code sample\n\n<details open><summary>Code sample</summary>\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:http/http.dart' as http;\n\n\nvoid main() {\n  runApp(Bug());\n}\n\nclass Bug extends StatelessWidget {\n

      "description" : "**Describe the bug**\nWhen doing an OAuth flow using dynamic client registration, the `token_endpoint_auth_method` returned in the registration data should be used to request a token, rather than the one from the OAuth authorization server metadata. Not doing this may cause an OAuth flow to fail if a strict server requires the method that was posted and used during client registration.\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n1. Use the code from the sample client (`src/examples/client/simpleOAuthClient.ts`) which specifies `token_endpoint_auth_method: 'client_secret_post'` in the `OAuthClientMetadata`.\n2. The client will register using `client_secret_post`, and we assume that the server will confirm that in the registration response.\n3. In `exchangeAuthorization` and in `refreshAuthorization` (`src/client/auth.ts`), the following code is used:\n```\n    // Determine and apply client authentication method\n    const supportedMethods = metadata?.token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported ?? [];\n    const authMethod = selectClientAuthMethod(clientInformation, supportedMethods);\n\n    applyClientAuthentication(authMethod, clientInformation, headers, params);\n```\nand `selectClientAuthMethod` uses this check which takes the supported methods from the OAuth authorization server `metadata`, rather than the `clientInformation`:\n```\n  if (hasClientSecret && supportedMethods.includes(\"client_secret_basic\")) {\n    return \"client_secret_basic\";\n  }\n```\n4. Server may reject the token response due to `client_secret_basic` being used rather than `client_secret_post` since the server may not need to honor `client_secret_basic` anymore after the client was registered with `client_secret_post`.\n\n\n**Expected behavior**\nPrefer the `token_endpoint_auth_method` from the client `clientInformation` that was obtained during registration, and only if it's unavailable fall back to the `metadata` from the OAuth authorization server.\n",

      "description" : "**Describe the bug**\n\nI've created an `MCPServer` instance connected to a `Client` via  an `InMemoryTransport`. If the server has not has `registerPrompt` called on it, the client raises an error when calling `listPrompts()`.\n\n**To Reproduce**\n\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n\n1. Make sure you're using the latest version of Bun. I don't know if this reproduces in other runtimes???I've only tested it in Bun.\n2. Install `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` via `bun add @modelcontextprotocol/sdk`.\n3. Create a file named `example.ts` with the following content:\n\n   ```typescript\n   import { Client } from \"@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/index.js\";\n   import { InMemoryTransport } from \"@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/inMemory.js\";\n   import { McpServer } from \"@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js\";\n\n   const server = new McpServer({\n     name: \"example\",\n     version: \"0.0.0\",\n   });\n\n   // Don't register any prompts\n\n   const [clientTransport, serverTransport] = InMemoryTransport.createLinkedPair();\n\n   const client = new Client({\n     name: \"example\",\n     version: \"0.0.0\",\n   });\n\n   await Promise.all([server.connect(serverTransport), client.connect(clientTransport)]);\n\n   console.log(await client.listPrompts());\n   ```\n\n4. Run the file using Bun: `bun run example.ts`.\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nThe script should output `[]`\n\n**Actual behavior**\n\nThe script produces this error:\n\n```\n1300 |     CallToolResultSchema,\n1301 |     ListToolsResultSchema,\n1302 | ]);\n1303 | export class McpError extends Error {\n1304 |     constructor(code, message, data) {\n1305 |         super(`MCP error ${code}: ${message}`);\n               ^\nMcpError: MCP error -32601: Method not found\n code: -32601,\n data: undefined,\n\n      at new McpError (/Users/landon/Development/mcp/node_modules/@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/dist/esm/types.js:1305:9)\n      at _onresponse (/Users/landon/Development/mcp/node_modules/@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/dist/esm/shared/protocol.js:223:27)\n      at <anonymous> (/Users/landon/Development/mcp/node_modules/@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/dist/esm/shared/protocol.js:84:22)\n      at send (/Users/landon/Development/mcp/node_modules/@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/dist/esm/inMemory.js:42:34)\n      at send (/Users/landon/Development/mcp/node_modules/@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/dist/esm/inMemory.js:37:16)\n      at _onrequest (/Users/landon/Development/mcp/node_modules/@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/dist/esm/shared/protocol.js:133:101)\n      at <anonymous> (/Users/landon/Development/mcp/node_modules/@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/dist/esm/shared/protocol.js:87:22)\n      at send (/Users/landon/Development/mcp/node_modules/@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/dist/esm/inMemory.js:42:34)\n      at send (/Users/landon/Development/mcp/node_modules/@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/dist/esm/inMemory.js:37:16)\n      at <anonymous> (/Users/landon/Development/mcp/node_modules/@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/dist/esm/shared/protocol.js:308:29)\n\nBun v1.2.21 (macOS arm64)\n```",

      "description" : "** Describe the bug **\nThe exchangeAuthorization() function in client/auth.js assumes OAuth token responses are always in JSON format and calls response.json() directly. However, many OAuth providers (including GitHub) return token responses in URL-encoded format (application/x-www-form-urlencoded), causing token exchange to fail with a JSON parsing error.\n\n** Steps to reproduce the behavior: **\nSet up OAuth authentication with GitHub's MCP server (https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp)\nRegister a GitHub OAuth app and configure pre-registered credentials\nComplete the authorization flow successfully (Step 1 works fine)\nAttempt token exchange in Step 2 of the OAuth flow\nObserve JSON parsing error when GitHub returns URL-encoded token response\n\n** Expected behavior **\nThe SDK should handle both common OAuth token response formats:\nJSON format: {\"access_token\": \"...\", \"token_type\": \"bearer\", \"scope\": \"...\"}\nURL-encoded format: access_token=...&token_type=bearer&scope=...\nThe token exchange should succeed regardless of which format the OAuth provider uses.\n\nLogs\n```\n\uD83D\uDD0D Token URL: https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token\n\uD83D\uDD0D Response Text: access_token=gho_oB*****************************&scope=gist%2Cnotifications%2Cpublic_repo&token_type=bearer\n\n??? SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'a', \"access_tok\"... is not valid JSON\n    at JSON.parse (<anonymous>)\n    at exchangeAuthorization (file://client/auth.js:335:41)\n```\n\n** Additional context **\nOAuth Standards: Both response formats are valid according to OAuth 2.0/2.1 specifications. Different providers use different formats.\nGitHub Behavior: GitHub's OAuth token endpoint returns URL-encoded responses by default, but does provide valid JSON when the new Accept request header is added. Not all oAuth servers will respect the Accept header though.\n\nCurrent SDK Code (line ~325 in client/auth.js):\n```\nconst response = await fetch(tokenUrl, {\n       method: \"POST\",\n       headers: {\n           \"Content-Type\": \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\",\n       },\n       body: params,\n   });\n   if (!response.ok) {\n       throw new Error(`Token exchange failed: HTTP ${response.status}`);\n   }\n   return OAuthTokensSchema.parse(await response.json()); // ??? Assumes JSON\n```\n\n** Suggested Fix **\n```\nconst response = await fetch(tokenUrl, {\n       method: \"POST\",\n       headers: {\n           \"Content-Type\": \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\",\n           \"Accept\": \"application/json\", // ??? Request JSON response\n       },\n       body: params,\n   });\n   if (!response.ok) {\n       throw new Error(`Token exchange failed: HTTP ${response.status}`);\n   }\n   \n   // ??? Handle both JSON and URL-encoded responses\n   const responseText = await response.text();\n   let tokenData;\n   try {\n       tokenData = JSON.parse(responseText);\n   } catch (jsonError) {\n       // Fallback to URL-encoded parsing\n       const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(responseText);\n       tokenData = {\n           access_token: urlParams.get(\"access_token\"),\n           token_type: urlParams.get(\"token_type\"),\n           scope: urlParams.get(\"scope\"),\n           refresh_token: urlParams.get(\"refresh_token\"),\n           expires_in: urlParams.get(\"expires_in\") ? parseInt(urlParams.get(\"expires_in\")) : undefined,\n       };\n   }\n   \n   return OAuthTokensSchema.parse(tokenData);\n```\nThis issue can be reproduced using GitHub's MCP server at https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp with proper GitHub OAuth app credentials. NOTE: There is a related issue with GitHubs oAuth where by it does not expose it's oAuth info on .well-known/oauth-authorization-server, but rather returns a resource_metadata=\"https://api.githubcopilot.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp\" param in the www-authenticate field (see #758)\n\n** Impact **\nThis affects compatibility with any OAuth provider that returns URL-encoded token responses, making the SDK incompatible with a significant portion of OAuth servers.",

It takes too much vertical space, especially on narrow screens. And clicking on Network trends adds more noise to the same.\n\n**Proposed Improvement (open to more ideas):**\n\n1. Replace the horizontal tab layout with a dropdown selector (e.g., ???Select Section???) when the screen width is below a certain breakpoint (e.g., md screen size in Tailwind).\n2. Keep the selected section highlighted or updated dynamically as users switch between options.\n3. Maintain existing tab functionality on desktop.\n\n**Benefits:**\n1. Cleaner UI on mobile.\n2. Easier navigation.\n3. Better consistency and readability.\n\n**Screenshots (Mobile view)**\n1.

Use the Cloudflare store as storage.\n2. Ask a question and see that the question+answer are logged to the console.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nEither log this when the developer wants a more verbose log or not logging at all.\n\n### Environment Information\n\n@mastra/cloudflare\": \"0.11.7\n\n### Verification\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues to make sure this is not a duplicate\n- [x] I have included sufficient information for the team to reproduce and understand the issue",

There's multiple things being discussed in this issue:\n\n1. Logging in with Gitlab as an Oauth provider using organice.200ok.ch\n2. Logging in with Gitlab as an Oauth provider using a local instance\n\nThose are separate, because you need credentials for setting up any OAuth backend. If you want to use Gitlab in your own instance, including a local instance, here's the relevant documentation: https://organice.200ok.ch/documentation.html#gitlab\n\nAs for option 1: I just tried it myself and _cannot_ reproduce the issue. I tried logging in multiple times from a fresh browser and each time, it worked fine. Here's a screen recording of the latest try: \n\n<video src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c91f5709-739c-4a00-be1d-4befcda1fa71?dl=1\"></video>\n\nUnfortunately, I don't see any logging options in Gitlab to debug anything related to OAuth. The _only_ metric Gitlab shows me is the number of clients which is well into the four digits. And, for every additional login, that I've made, that number has increased by one.\n\nAdditionally, if I wait long enough, I'll see that number increase even though I didn't do anything. That leads me to suspect that other people successfully use Gitlab as OAuth provider on organice.200ok.ch\n\nAfter some more thought, I think your screenshot yields a potential answer! You get a `cancelled for the request to `/authorized`. . This usually happens before any network data is exchanged, so it???s not a server error but a client-side interruption. Could you try with a browser without any plugins and customizations?", "> Could you try with a browser without any plugins and customizations?\n\nI can still reproduce this running without extensions (using `chromium-browser --disable-extensions`). FWIW, `chromium-browser --version` shows `Chromium 142.0.7444.59`.\n\nAlso (like @dtvillafana) I can reproduce on mobile (Chrome on Android), where it's a bit more of a problem because the devtools workaround is not available.", "While investigating this further, I noticed that while PKCE is used for GitLab OAuth, the request still [includes `clientSecret` as a request param](https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/blob/ddd71529f13d12dbd73b159c802c93c6026316ab/src/sync_backend_clients/gitlab_sync_backend_client.js#L22) (also verified that it is present in the request URL in the deployed version).\n\nI'm not an expert in OAuth/PKCE and haven't been able to follow the code well enough to understand if this is a real security issue or just a red herring, but seemed worth raising.", "Apologies, I should have added more context.\nI had been successfully using Organice with Gitlab as the Sync backend, but I eventually got logged out on my phone, and it has not been working (due to above error) for the last 2 weeks at the very least.\nOn my phone, I had been using:\nBrave 1.84.133, Chromium 142.0.7444.53 on Android 16; Build/BP2A.250605.031.A3\nBut I was also able to reproduce the bug on Linux desktop (NixOS 25.05) with Brave Browser 1.84.135, Chromium 142.1.84.135\n\nWhen using Brave, I turned off \"Brave Shields\" for Organice, so I'd like to think that decreased the likelihood this is a Brave specific error, and is rather a Chromium error.\n\nLikely related to what was mentioned by @mcwitt , I get the following error in the console:\nindex.js:759 Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'digest')\n    at e.generatePKCECodes (index.js:759:14)\n    at e.<anonymous> (index.js:430:34)\n    at u (index.js:60:23)\n    at Object.next (index.js:41:53)\n    at index.js:35:71\n    at new Promise (<anonymous>)\n    at $ed60001202da65be$var$__awaiter (index.js:31:12)\n    at e.fetchAuthorizationCode (index.js:422:16)\n    at o (index.js:120:27)\n    at Object.s (react-dom.production.min.js:14:428)\n\nwhich means it might have to do with this [backend sync file](https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/blob/master/src/sync_backend_clients/gitlab_sync_backend_client.js) but I am not a JS dev, so take that with a grain of salt.\n\nI am using the public Gitlab instance :)\nI deployed Organice from the latest commit on master to a nixos box.\nI can share a basic flake for the app build if you'd like.", "Ok, so I did some additional investigation. Signing in to Gitlab works for these browser/os combinations:\n\n- Firefox 144 / Debian Sid\n- Chrome 137 / Debian Sid\n- Safari / iOS 18.6.2\n\nIt does not work in Chrome 141 on Debian.\n\nSo, it does look quite likely that this is a recent Chrome related issue. I didn't realize that before. Mainly, because Firefox is my primary driver and secondly, because Chrome recently disabled web extensions v2 which in turn made good extensions impossible to use.\n\nSo, personally one day after that happened, I opted to lock Chrome to the last unbroken version like so:\n\n```\n  flatpak update --commit=87e924cf2b4809a25ed5fc099d44747c252d0dc3dac301ff17107f03134abe8b com.google.Chrome\n  flatpak run --command=sh com.google.Chrome -c 'rm -rf\n  ~/.var/app/com.google.Chrome'\n\n  1. chrome:://flags\n     - disable all manifest warnings\n     - enable 'legacy' manifest\n  2. chrome://extensions\n     - go to ublock origin github release page\n     - download the latest release\n     - load unpacked extension\n```\n\nHaving said all that, I'm of course in favor of finding out if we can re-enable Gitlab sign-in for current versions of Chrome. I don't have a solution for that, yet. In the meantime, at least you have the option of using another browser for organice.\n\nWould anyone be open to work on finding out what changed in Chrome and provide a fix?", "https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/pull/1061 fixes the issue for me locally. @dtvillafana are you able to confirm? (edit: or @munen , I missed that you have a repro now too)", "I can confirm that with #1061 I no longer get the \"Unexpected sign in error, please try again\" error, however, when clicking the Sign-in button for Gitlab, I still get the same PCKECodes error logged to console that I noted before, and Gitlab will still not sign in.\n\n``` JS\nindex.js:759 Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'digest')\n    at e.generatePKCECodes (index.js:759:14)\n    at e.<anonymous> (index.js:430:34)\n    at u (index.js:60:23)\n    at Object.next (index.js:41:53)\n    at index.js:35:71\n    at new Promise (<anonymous>)\n    at $06cc4c14b892ef52$var$__awaiter (index.js:31:12)\n    at e.fetchAuthorizationCode (index.js:422:16)\n    at o (index.js:121:27)\n    at Object.s (react-dom.production.min.js:14:428)\n```", "@dtvillafana could you try clearing local storage for the app if you haven't already? (e.g. in the devtools \"Application\" tab, right-click and \"Clear\"). I found that the bug left some corrupted state and I wasn't able to sign in again until I did this.", "@mcwitt Unfortunately, same error. Tried clearing local storage, session storage, and cookies and retrying sign-in multiple times.\nGotta love browsers and web dev, everything always changing under you...\nThis might be what pushes me over to running NixOS on a Pinephone (overreaction I know).", "@dtvillafana looking more closely at the error trace you posted, this actually looks like a different (and I think unrelated) error that I also hit while trying to debug the main issue.\n\nIn my case, I get that error when running the server locally and accessing it via http://0.0.0.0:3000 (i.e. the binding address printed to the console by `yarn start`). When I instead access http://localhost:3000, I do not get the error and sign-in works for me on the PR branch.\n\nDigging into this a bit more, I think it has to do with the crypto API being unavailable in [insecure contexts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts) (the actual source of the error appears to be the line containing `return crypto.subtle.digest('SHA-256', new TextEncoder().encode(codeVerifier))` in the library code).\n\nAssuming this is also your issue, would you be able to try http://localhost:3000 with and without the diff in #1061 ? (and also starting with fresh local storage; ugh, this is a messy issue)" ],

The user's reporting that with percentage formatting (`Format=\"P2\"`), the field *displays* the value correctly, but you can't *change* it by typing or using the stepper arrows. That's definitely a bug ??? it's broken functionality.  They've even provided a handy `try.mudblazor.com` snippet to reproduce it, which is ideal.  The code itself seems to be the culprit. The workaround already suggested appears to be really clear. Someone's given a custom `Converter<T>` and even a potential fix in `DefaultConverter<T>`, so that's a huge help.\nThe context is that it's been around for a while ??? June 2023. A maintainer removed the triage label back in May, meaning they saw it, but nothing has happened yet.  It's not assigned, but there is a clear community interest in this. The original author isn't a maintainer, which is fine, and there's 6 reactions and some decent comments.\nFrom my perspective, this is a clear `bug`. The \"good first issue\" label seems spot on, since there's a good reproduction and the workaround clearly shows where the problem is. Now, given that the last human activity (a cross-reference) was way back in April 2024, and it's October 2025, it's also meeting the `stale` criteria for bugs.  The issue has been inactive for a long time. There's no reason to hold off, and no other special circumstances.\nSo, the plan is to tag it as `stale` to get the ball rolling, hopefully getting someone's attention. I'll add the `stale` label with the standard comment, and leave the current set of labels as they are. That means that the current labels are `bug`, `good first issue`, `has workaround`, and the new one `stale`. The summary of the issue will be \"MudNumericField with percentage formatting (Format=\\\"P2\\\") cannot be edited, though a workaround using a custom converter has been provided.\"\n-->", "Bumping this", "For me, the initial reporter, it can be closed as the workaround with the converter works fine. Don't know if I should close it myself \uD83E\uDD37????????? " ],

If you identify the PR, comment on the issue with a link to it. If not, mention the commit hash of the oldest commit you saw the bug on (and the month and year it was made in).\n\nThen, please leave a comment with details of the approach that you plan to take to fix the issue (see [example](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/issues/19157#issuecomment-1858788463)).\n\n**Note:** If this is your first Oppia issue, please make sure to follow our guidelines for [choosing an issue](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Contributing-code-to-Oppia#choosing-a-good-first-issue) and [setting things up](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Contributing-code-to-Oppia#setting-things-up). You will also need to show a demo of the fix working correctly on your local machine. Thanks!\n",

      "description" : "**Is your feature request related to a use case or problem? Please describe.**\r\nThe `__pow__` operator for `CliffordGate` is implemented only for integer powers and has complexity $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ where $n$ is the exponent.\r\nhttps://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/ec84a057614396bf89459cd141a5f77b4d01ed48/cirq-core/cirq/ops/clifford_gate.py#L399-L411\r\n\r\nFor  `SingleQubitCliffordGate` it's implemented for only integer powers where it falls to `CliffordGate.__pow__` and for $\\pm \\sqrt{}$.\r\nhttps://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/ec84a057614396bf89459cd141a5f77b4d01ed48/cirq-core/cirq/ops/clifford_gate.py#L718-L728\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nFor `CliffordGate.__pow__` exponentiation should be done using [binary exponentiation](https://cp-algorithms.com/algebra/binary-exp.html) to reduce the complexity ot $\\mathcal{O}(\\log{n})$. Support for non integer exponents is hard in the general case.\r\n\r\nFor `SingleQubitCliffordGate.__pow__`. The single qubit clifford gates are a group of size 24. see. https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/ec84a057614396bf89459cd141a5f77b4d01ed48/cirq-core/cirq/ops/clifford_gate.py#L149\r\n\r\nsupport for integer powers can be done in $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ if we either fall to the optimized `CliffordGate.__pow__` but with `exponent%24` instead of `expnent` or cache the results in table and access `group_powers[self][exponent%24]`. For rational exponents, When the clifford operation has a sqrt. The operation becomes well defined for exponents of the form $\\frac{k}{2}$ where $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.  For example $X^\\frac{5}{2}$ is the same as $SqrtX^5$ and $X^\\frac{-5}{2}$ which is the same as $(SqrtX^\\dagger)^5$.\r\n\r\n\r\n**What is the urgency from your perspective for this issue? Is it blocking important work?**\r\n<!-- Please choose one and remove the others -->\r\n\r\nP3 - I'm not really blocked by it, it is an idea I'd like to discuss / suggestion based on principle ",

I am a new contributor and picked up this issue as my first task.\n\nI started implementing it and wanted to check if I have the right understanding.\nASGITransport works well for normal request/response tests, but it does not support streaming. It buffers until the application completes, so SSE, WebSockets, and other long-lived streams do not behave correctly. MCP relies on SSE and web socket functionality for testing, so those tests still appear to require a real server such as uvicorn.\n\nI also tried `StreamingASGITransport` in `src/mcp/server/streaming_asgi_transport.py` [here](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk/blob/main/src/mcp/server/streaming_asgi_transport.py) for SSE tests, but I encountered resource and event loop cleanup issues (for example, resource busy and event loop closed errors). It does not currently seem like a drop-in replacement for uvicorn for streaming tests.\n\n\nBefore I continue, can you confirm whether the intended approach for this issue is:\n* Use ASGITransport for standard HTTP tests\n* Keep uvicorn for SSE and streaming tests\n* Document why both are required and reference the upstream issues\n\nI wanted to check that I am aligned with the intended direction before submitting a PR.\nThank you.", "We should implement the transport on our side, if it can't handle stream.

I am attempting to use the /.well-known/ endpoints for OAuth authentication and authorization. Unfortunately, it seems that the routes for the /.well-known/ endpoints; as well as the other OAuth endpoints /authorize, /token, /register, and /revoke, are all hardcoded in the MCP SDK within mcp/server/auth/routes.py within the create_auth_routes() function.\n\nSo, for example...\n\nIf my MCP server is deployed at https://{my-gateway}/custom/path/\nHowever, the well-known endpoints are pointing to https://{my-gateway}/.well-known/*, which are obviously returning 404 Not Found responses.\n\nWhen starting my server, I am passing the 'path' parameter in the mcp.run() command.  Using my example above, my run command would look like -- mcp.run(transport=\"http\", host=\"0.0.0.0\", port=8080, path=\"/custom/path/mcp\").  However, this path parameter seems to have zero effect on the OAuth well-known endpoints.\n\nSo, the question is... Is this expected behavior, and if so, how should we run MCP servers that use well-knonw OAuth endpoints behind API Proxies (Apigee, APIM, etc) or GKE Gateways that require a custom path?\n\n### Additional Context\n\nmcp version  -- 1.13.1\nfastmcp version -- 2.11.4.dev128+5b433f5",

However, the listed Expected Behavior in this pull request states: \"The .well-known/oauth-protected-resource endpoint should always be served at the root path (/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource) regardless of the resource_server_url configuration\".  That seems the exact opposite of what would be needed in use cases like mine where the MCP server must run at a custom path.  When attached to a GKE gateway (or Api proxy such as Apigee), serving the well-known endpoints from the root path is always going to return 404 responses.", "Hi @whitewg77 - The root cause is because the well-known URL generated for WWW authenticated header (used to tell the client where the well-known endpoint is) and the real well-known route endpoint are mismatched.\n\nFor WWW authenticated header, the existing implementation appends the `.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` directly after the resource_server_url.\n\n```\nhttp://0.0.0.0:8000/custom/path/mcp/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource\n```\n\nFor route endpoint generation, it append the `.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` directly after the root URL.\n\n```\nhttp://0.0.0.0:8000/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource\n```\n\nTherefore, if we have customized path, it will cause a mismatch between those two and lead to 404.\n\n\nI have implemented a fix for this https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk/pull/1407." ],

      "description" : "### Description\n\nCurrently, when a ClientSession is created and no client_info arg is passed, it uses the default client info object. My expectation would be that upon session initialization, the clientinfo data is updated with the value returned from the MCP server it connected to. This information is available within the InitializationResult but not used by the SDK so the only way to get that info is to grab it during initialization manually.\n\nExample of grabbing info like the name defined by the MCP server when the client connects:\n```python\n            transport = await self.exit_stack.enter_async_context(\n                streamablehttp_client(server_url, headers=headers)\n            )\n            self.read, self.write, _ = transport\n            self.session = await self.exit_stack.enter_async_context(\n                ClientSession(self.read, self.write)\n            )\n\n            server = await self.session.initialize()\n            self.name = server.serverInfo.name  # <====\n```\n\nClientSession does the following:\n```python\nclass ClientSession(\n    BaseSession[\n        types.ClientRequest,\n        types.ClientNotification,\n        types.ClientResult,\n        types.ServerRequest,\n        types.ServerNotification,\n    ]\n):\n    def __init__(\n        self,\n        read_stream: MemoryObjectReceiveStream[SessionMessage | Exception],\n        write_stream: MemoryObjectSendStream[SessionMessage],\n        # ...\n        client_info: types.Implementation | None = None,\n    ) -> None:\n        super().__init__(...)\n        self._client_info = client_info or DEFAULT_CLIENT_INFO # <<<<<<\n       # ...\n\n    async def initialize(self) -> types.InitializeResult:\n        # ...\n        result = await self.send_request(\n            types.ClientRequest(\n                types.InitializeRequest(\n                    method=\"initialize\",\n                    params=types.InitializeRequestParams(\n                        protocolVersion=types.LATEST_PROTOCOL_VERSION,\n                        capabilities=types.ClientCapabilities(\n                            sampling=sampling,\n                            experimental=None,\n                            roots=roots,\n                        ),\n                        clientInfo=self._client_info,\n                    ),\n                )\n            ),\n            types.InitializeResult,\n        )\n        # ...\n        return result\n```\n\nThe result is returned but ClientSession._client_info is not updated with the values coming from the result. The simplest thing would just be to set _client_info to serverInfo.\n\n### References\n\n_No response_",

I don't think that makes a perf difference on any recent CPU, but it does show that we could do better at canonicalizing in codegen too?\nYeah, missed it. But w.r.t. performance all three will be similar while for Arm and Riscv there is difference.\nI don't think that makes a perf difference on any recent CPU, but it does show that we could do better at canonicalizing in codegen too?\nagreed!\nFixes AArch64 part with https://reviews.llvm.org/D132322,\nOn the IR side, we could generalize the factoring to patterns with no constants: https://alive2.llvm.org/ce/z/mbsDdE\nThat's likely better in IR since it eliminates a use of 'x', but it's probably worse in codegen for most targets (especially if they have a 'madd' instruction).\nOn 2nd thought, madd codegen looks fine either way (at least for aarch64):\nsrc:\nadd  w8, w0, w2\nmadd  w0, w0, w1, w8\tgt:\nmadd  w8, w0, w1, w0\nadd  w0, w8, w2\nThe 'tgt' form with dependent ops might have a longer critical path without madd, but that should be invertible in codegen.\nProposal to improve canonicalization in IR: https://reviews.llvm.org/D132412,\nThe IR for @foo looks silly @rotateright\nThat part should be fixed in IR at least with:\nf7ab70cf8df6117312a\nD132412 was initially going to change the bar() IR, but that patch ended up fixing another pattern, and we still miss bar().\nIt's still up to the backend to decompose the mul if that's better for the target.\nThis issue is still exist for the 2nd function **bar**, https://godbolt.org/z/vjree4xfY,\nProposal to improve canonicalization in IR of **bar** , https://reviews.llvm.org/D136623,\n@vfdff It seems like the patch was abandoned? are you still planning to work on it?\n@hiraditya I can rebase that change onto trunk and try to getting it in. Would that be helpful?, yes please.\nHi, is anyone actively working on this issue? I see an open pull request corresponding to this issue, was wondering if it's being actively worked on?\nI???m not working on it, I think it is pleasure you can continue on this as there is no update for a long time @gxyd,\nThank you for your reply. I'll get started with it then.\n@hiraditya , can you maybe assign the issue to me?\nShould probably ask @tetsuo-cpp what their plans for the PR are first.\n@gxyd Go for it! Thanks for working on this. Unfortunately, I got busy and won't have time to spend on getting that PR in.\nI'll close the open PR but will leave the branch on my fork in case you want to use it. Although, it's been a while since I rebased so it might not be useful to you.\nIs this issue being worked on, or should it be closed?\nClang-22 seems to do this right for RISCV/32/64 (for the three sample cases):\n    slli   a1, a0, 3\n    slli   a0, a0, 1\n    not    a0, a0\n    add[w] a0, a0, a1\nSounds good.]",

Is this still a real problem in the current version? We are many versions away from this particular build. I would like you to please carefully review their stated problem and look for similar github issues as well. Perhaps we already fixed this problem a in a previous update.  Really focus on determining root cause yourself by reviewing the code ", "Thank you for reporting this issue! \uD83D\uDE4F\n\nI've completed my analysis and this is a valid **enhancement request**. Here's what I found:\n\n## Research Findings\n\n**Root Cause:** The export functionality (located in `src/integrations/misc/export-markdown.ts`) currently only exports the conversation history as markdown. It does **not** include task metadata such as:\n- Total API cost (`totalCost`)\n- Token usage (`tokensIn`, `tokensOut`)\n- Cache metrics (`cacheWrites`, `cacheReads`)\n\nWhile this metadata is tracked and displayed in the UI (visible in `TaskHeader.tsx` and `HistoryView.tsx`), it's not passed to the export function.\n\n## Triage Score: 72/100\n\n| Criteria | Score | Notes |\n|----------|-------|-------|\n| Clarity & Reproducibility | 21/25 | Clear steps and expected behavior |\n| Evidence | 8/25 | Screenshot provided, sufficient for an enhancement |\n| Location Confidence | 20/20 | Code located and analyzed |\n| Root Cause | 15/20 | Clear understanding of what's missing |\n| Fix Feasibility | 8/10 | Straightforward implementation |\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nThe fix would involve:\n1. Modifying the `downloadTask` function to accept task metadata (costs, tokens, cache metrics)\n2. Adding a metadata header section to the exported markdown\n3. Formatting the cost/token data in a readable format for tracking\n\nThis is indeed a valuable enhancement for cost monitoring and analysis. The fix is localized and shouldn't require breaking changes.\n\n**Labels updated:**\n- ??? Added: `enhancement`\n- ??? Removed: `Investigation Needed`\n- ??? Keeping: `Good First Issue` (straightforward implementation)\n\nIf you'd like to contribute this enhancement, I'd be happy to provide more specific implementation guidance! \uD83D\uDE0A", "Hi @NightTrek ,\n\nI've completed the code for this feature.

      "description" : "Probes of all kinds currently support FailureThreshold (and SuccessThreshold), these properties allow a user to specify that Kubernetes should not take action in response to a failed probe unless it fails a successive number of times.\r\n\r\nThis is useful for  end-users as it allows them to mitigate the effects of any probes that \"flake\" by requiring successive failure.\r\n\r\nWhen a probe fails in Kubernetes, we emit a container event indicating this here: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/kubelet/prober/prober.go#L110 and end-users can consume these events via the API for their own purposes. This event is emitted regardless of whether the FailureThreshold has been reached or not.\r\n\r\nCurrently when a user consumes a probe failure event they have no way of knowing whether the event resulted in action on the control plane (because the event can be ignored due to FailureThreshold, and information on this is not included in the event). This can lead to users assuming there is a problem and a container/pod was restarted when nothing occurred.\r\n\r\nI think we should expose the keepGoing value from https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/kubelet/prober/worker.go#L203 in the emitted event somehow, my preferred solution is to emit the probe failure event in the worker rather than where it currently sits in https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/kubelet/prober/prober.go#L110 - there is also the option of passing some information down the stack into the prober from the worker (such as making the FailureThreshold/SuccessThreshold decision in the prober) but I'm worried about separation of concerns, happy to hear what other folks think :)\r\n\r\nAlso of note is that FailureThreshold/SuccessThreshold is the only filter I can see where a probe can be ignored after being run (and therefore emitting a container event)\r\n\r\nI???m happy to write this PR once we???re confident in our approach :)\r\n",

The reasoning is limitless at this point.\r\n\r\nAdditionally:\r\nFor browser extensions, it is also possible to use [Native Messaging](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/native-messaging) concept, but that it not too clear and isn't open as WebSocket protocol.",

      "description" : "Hello Probo Team,\n\nI propose adding Internationalization (i18n) support to Probo. This feature would significantly increase the global reach and adoption of the platform, especially among non-English-speaking startups interested in achieving security compliance.\n\nValue Proposition\nGlobal Compliance Adoption: Standards like GDPR, ISO 27001, and SOC 2 are relevant worldwide. Localizing the Probo interface and general documentation would make the process far more accessible to global teams.\n\nUser Experience: A localized interface minimizes ambiguity and reduces the cognitive load for compliance managers, leading to higher accuracy and adoption rates.\n\nKey Consideration: Framework-Specific Localization\nIt is important to consider that while the UI/App experience should be localizable (e.g., in Spanish for a user in Mexico), the content of specific compliance frameworks might need to remain in a required language for external auditing.\n\nFor example, a user may wish to manage their ISO 27001 documentation in Spanish, but their SOC 2 Type II report and underlying artifacts might still need to be generated or maintained in English because most specialized auditors require it.\n\nTherefore, the ideal i18n solution would allow:\n\nUI Language: Set per-user or globally (e.g., Spanish).\n\nFramework/Content Language: Set per-framework (e.g., ISO 27001 in Spanish, SOC 2 in English).\n\nMy Contribution\nI am willing to contribute the initial Spanish localization files for the UI and work on translating key elements once an i18n framework has been implemented.\n\nCould the team please evaluate the feasibility of integrating i18n with this distinction in mind?",

The only way to overcome this error is a full page reload in the browser.\n\nThis occuring due to not having proper error boundaries at the feature level. Instead we have resorted to an app-level ErrorBoundary [1]. The drawback of this approach is that, when the application encounters an error, the app-level ErrorBoundary will hit and it will cause the whole application to be not responsive.\n\n<img width=\"1680\" height=\"855\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca490551-4b8a-4000-a606-1809efa16e7c\" />\n\n[1] - https://github.com/wso2/identity-apps/blob/96fdade8c9c0b645a1eb1bb1161f5b73a63923ec/apps/console/src/layouts/app-layout.tsx#L64\n\n\n### Suggested Improvement\n\nWe should find a way to gracefully handle this error while allowing the users to navigate to other side panel items regardless of crashing in a different tab.\n\n### Please select the area issue is related to\n\nOther\n\n### Version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Developer Checklist\n\n- [ ] [Behavioural Change] Does this change introduce a behavioral change to the product?\n- [ ] ??????

At what level were you thinking of integrating it?\n\nThe pattern used in https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk/pull/882 (extending httpx.Auth) could potentially be used, even outside the SDK itself. Whether things make it into the SDK might instead be a question for the protocol itself / e.g. [this SEP](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues/1046) suggests adding client credentials", "Discussed with the maintainers there:\nThe license is open source for everyone, there is a possibility to gain support through commercial license.\nThey provide a httpx implementation here https://docs.authlib.org/en/latest/client/httpx.html\n\nMy idea is to contribute to authlib for all rfc we need so we have minimum support to do here", "I proposed it on Discord, so... I'm happy.\n\nThe license is [BSD-3-Clause](https://github.com/authlib/authlib/blob/main/LICENSE), the same as Starlette. ", "I'm onboard with this. My one wish would be to do it in a way that's pluggable, so if someone does not want to use authlib, they can swap in something else.\n\nthe httpx approach seems like a good hook to make this generic.\n\nFor example, if we are prototyping around an RFC not supported in authlib, I'd like to be able to easily swap in an implementation rather than have to patch authlib and cross-link etc.", "I suggest we modernize and modularize the OAuthProvider implementation with the following goals in mind:\n\nComposable workflow: Design the provider to expose a simple, override-friendly flow. This allows contributors and integrators to easily test or swap in custom behavior without duplicating the whole logic.\n\nLeverage Authlib: Instead of implementing OAuth/OIDC specs manually, we should rely on authlib to handle protocol compliance. This reduces maintenance burden and ensures adherence to standards, unless we're handling custom flow control.\n\nConfigurable flows: Structure parameterization so that each officially supported OAuth flow (e.g., Authorization Code, Client Credentials, etc.) can be easily configured via clean, declarative settings.\n\nExtensibility: Leave room for additional/custom parameters in the configuration. This makes it easier to extend or override specific parts of the provider logic while keeping the configuration accessible and consistent.", "That all sounds great to me" ],

Instead I would suggest a working change as follow:\n\n1. remove the stderr params from the process and handle process.stderr in an async function as stdout / stdin is handled.\n2. to that effect, use a `stderr_reader` async function  like the following:\n\n```python\n    async def stderr_reader():\n        assert process.stderr, \"Opened process is missing stderr\"\n        try:\n            async for line in process.stderr:\n                if is_jupyter_notebook():\n                    print(f\"\\033[91m {line.decode().strip()}\")\n                else:\n                    # redirect to stderr as before\n                    print(line.decode().strip(), file=sys.stderr)\n        except anyio.ClosedResourceError:\n            await anyio.lowlevel.checkpoint()\n```\n\nThis would result in the same behavior as before while allowing the stderr to be logged in the jupyter notebook context.\n\n**Additional context**\nJupyter notebook support support is also requested for mcpadapt which bring MCP server tools in any agentic framework, as many agentic framework demonstrate usage in jupyter notebooks.\nhttps://github.com/grll/mcpadapt \n",

The pull request has not been merged yet. #400 ", "> Also, it is unclear what the `extra` parameters should be for.\n\nThe built-in Python logger takes an `extra` parameter, \"which can be used to pass a dictionary which is used to populate the `__dict__` of the `LogRecord` created for the logging event with user-defined attributes\" (link to docs [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.Logger.debug)). While the Python logger doesn't have built-in support for JSON, many logging libraries like AWS Powertools and `loguru` do, and they add the `**extra` kwargs to the output JSON log. For example `logger.debug(\"My log message.\", foo=\"FOO\")` is written as `{\"message\": \"My log message.\", \"foo\": \"FOO\"}`. \n\nI'm not sure if it's within the scope of this Issue, but as the `modelcontextprotocol` code currently stands, `Context.debug` and friends pass the `**kwargs` through to `Context.log`, which doesn't take a `**kwargs`. Calling `Context.debug(\"My log message, foo=\"FOO\")` results in a `TypeError: Context.log got an unexpected keyword argument 'foo'`.

Please describe\n\nCurrently, when the [throttle logger](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/7c99b710aa8c32dac31027a1953f0e058b8c44e5/lib/logger/throttler.go#L56) is used, logs may be silently dropped to avoid flooding. However, this can mislead users who rely on logs for debugging or operational insight. They might assume the log output represents the full picture when it's not true. \n\nRelated to https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/9447\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nTo improve transparency, the throttle logger should periodically emit a message indicating how many log entries were dropped. This provides a hint to users that they might not be seeing the full log stream and helps them make better-informed decisions during troubleshooting.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_",

When the batch finishes, we emit a separate summary log for that batch\nshall i implement this ? ", "> The good thing about attaching Similar %d xxx is that it???s easy to be noticed. As I understand, the current biggest issue is that users may not realize their logs have been throttled.\n\nI doubt it would be easier to notice since only one of many messages would include the `Similar %d xxx` suffix (if we throttle, then there are many similar-looking messages in logs). Even if someone comes across that specific message, they???d have to read the entire line carefully to spot the suffix. When skimming through logs, it???s easy to overlook it.\n\n> It's likely users won't know the connection between the otlp_skipped_sample log throttler and the unsupported delta temporality message, unless they check the code.\n\nThis part is valid. Without the source code, it would be hard to connect the dots. It could be improved IMO. Instead of printing `otlp_skipped_sample`, it can print a part of the original message being throttled.\n\nI realized that nothing stops a developer from using the throttle logger with different kinds of messages. I don't know if this is the case; I've not checked the code. Should be considered. ", "I???ve reviewed the throttle implementation. It works differently than I thought. In practice, we emit one message per throttle `name` for each `throttle` time interval. Given that, @Haleygo  approach makes perfect sense: we can append a suffix to the message that???s passed through, indicating how many were dropped.\n\nLet???s proceed with @Haleygo`s approach.", "The PR https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/9752 has been merged. Now the logged message would contain additional information on how many similar messages have been throttled. It should simplify debugging. The change will be available in next release" ],

I know its a bit of a hack but the failure I saw when running in safer mode was wsm failing to load. Safest mode was already defaulting to error message but the spinner never went away. The pr only displays the main div when js is enabled and wsm is found (both being true only happens when in standard mode on tor from what I understand). One thing to take into consideration is the dependency on wsm. I am new to this project but if there is a future where wsm is not a requirement then it could end up being undefined and standard mode would display the error message by default. This would likely be caught in that case. I am happy to address any concerns and I look forward to digging through the project to see where else I could be helpful. Let me know what you guys think and if you would need an extra pair of hands/eyes anywhere\n\n@KoalaSat @f321x apologies for the ping, I don't know what your pr review process is like or how you prefer to tackle propesed changes/bugfixes/etc. So if this is a bother, my apologies. I just know things get lost in my inbox sometimes and a ping could be helpful. That is all I intended but if its an annoyance just say the word. All the best!" ],

The disks now fit on screen but on hosts running Proxmox for example, there is a lot of disks shown here.\n\n<img width=\"1232\" height=\"1319\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a75b64f1-c642-491a-ac69-8a9483286967\" />\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nIt would be nice if in the configuration screen for the infrastructure monitor you could select which disks to monitor. For this to make sense, having the mointpoint be shown is essential. Otherwise I don't know what disk 1 or disk 32 is and if I want to monitor it or not.\n\nIt could for example look like this in the interface. However I am not entirely sure how I feel about the layout just yet... The mountpoint can be quite long and this might not be the best way to display it since it wraps quite quickly due to lack of space. Other people might be able to chime in here.\n\n<img width=\"476\" height=\"366\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7c0b506-dab2-476c-bf6a-851fb8373aeb\" />\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nHave not been able to figure out an alternative since I can't just go and disconnect disks. :)\n\n**Additional context**\nThe best way would be to add Capture agents to all containers and VM's on the hosts but monitoring the host itself for disk space utilization is also very usefull. Since 3 VM's with 100 GB disk each will not know that the host disk of 200 GB is running out of space.",

      "description" : "## Description\n\nWe have a bunch of magic strings spread throughout the app.\nOne of the prominent ones being `mm-online`: https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Amedic%2Fcht-core+mm-online&type=code\nThis is not the only example. \n\n## Goals\n\n- [ ] Collect all reused magic strings and add them to a shared library. \n\n## Expected Outcome\n\nThere should be a single source of truth for the magic numbers, strings, etc. used throughout `cht-core` which is `shared-libs/constants`.\n\n## Implementation Details\n\nWelcome, First-time contributor! Here's how you can succeed in this task.\nFirst, some background. Shared libraries are those collections of code that are available to be used throughout the `cht-core`. They are located in `cht-core/shared-libs`. This task wants you to create another shared library called `constants` where all the constants of `cht-core` will be stored as a single source of truth.\n\n1. Create a new folder in `cht-core/shared-libs` called `constants`.\n2. Create a new folder `src` inside the folder created above with an `index.js` file.\n3. Create a `package.json` file inside the `constants` folder. Add some mandatory fields like `name`, `version`, `description`, etc. Other shared libraries can be a good reference for this. Keep this file minimal.\n4. Start adding constant values in the `src/index.js` file. Refer to this [comment](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/9621#issuecomment-2464647266) as to what values are to be converted to constants. Also, you can do some research and add constants as required.\n5. Replace the values in the code with the `constants` library values. The way to use a library from a shared library is:\n    ```javascript\n    const constants = require('@medic/constants');\n\n    // use\n    constants.a;\n    constants.b;\n    ...\n    ```\n6. After you replace a value in the `cht-core` code, with a constant value, be sure to run the tests to make sure that nothing has changed. The tests can be run using the `npm` commands: `npm run integration-all-local` for integration tests, `npm run unit` for unit tests and `npm run wdio-local` for automation tests.\n\n## Product Name\n\nCommunity Health Toolkit: CHT Core\n\n## Organisation Name\n\nMedic\n\n## Domain\n\nHealthcare\n\n## Tech Skills Needed\n\nJavaScript, Typescript, Mocha, Node.js\n\n## Organizational Mentor\n\n@sugat009\n\n## Complexity\n\nLow\n\n## Category\n\nMaintenance",

      "description" : "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### What happened?\n\n## \uD83D\uDCCC Issue Overview  \n\n**Landing Page Repository Input Not Connected to CodeGraph Indexing**\n\nThe landing page allows users to enter a GitHub repository URL, but clicking \"Analyze Repository\" fails because the frontend calls a non-existent backend API endpoint (`/api/repo-stats`). The repository indexing functionality with FalkorDB exists in the codebase but is not exposed via the REST API for the web frontend.\n\n---\n\n## \uD83D\uDD0D Steps to Reproduce  \n\n1. Go to the landing page (`LandingPage.tsx`)  \n2. Enter a valid GitHub repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/AOSSIE-Org/Devr.AI`) \n3. Click on \"Analyze Repository\" button  \n4. See the error toast: \"Failed to fetch repository stats. Please check the URL or backend server.\"\n\n---\n\n## \uD83C\uDFAF Expected Behavior  \n\n1. User enters a GitHub repository URL in the landing page\n2. Frontend sends the URL to backend API endpoint\n3. Backend calls `RepoService.index_repo()` to index the repository using FalkorDB CodeGraph\n4. Repository is cloned, analyzed, and stored as a graph in FalkorDB\n5. Indexing metadata (status, node count, edge count) is saved to Supabase\n6. User receives success message with repository stats\n7. User is navigated to the dashboard showing the indexed repository data\n\n---\n\n## \uD83D\uDEA8 Actual Behavior  \n\n1. User enters a GitHub repository URL in the landing page\n2. Frontend attempts to POST to `http://localhost:8000/api/repo-stats` (line 23 in `LandingPage.tsx`)\n3. Request fails with 404 - endpoint does not exist in the backend\n4. User sees error toast message\n5. No repository indexing occurs\n6. User cannot proceed to dashboard\n\n**Technical Details:**\n\nThe frontend makes this call:\n```typescript\nconst response = await axios.post('http://localhost:8000/api/repo-stats', { repo_url: repoUrl });\n```\n\nBut `/api/repo-stats` endpoint is **not defined** in:\n- ??? `backend/app/api/router.py`\n- ??? `backend/app/api/v1/` (no repositories endpoint)\n\n**However, the infrastructure exists:**\n- ??? `backend/app/services/codegraph/repo_service.py` - Complete `RepoService` class\n- ??? `RepoService.index_repo()` method works (tested via Discord bot)\n- ??? FalkorDB integration functional\n- ??? Supabase database with `indexed_repositories` table\n- ??? Just missing the REST API layer to expose this functionality\n\n---\n\n### Files to Modify:\n- `backend/app/api/v1/repositories.py` (create new file)\n- `backend/app/api/router.py` (add router registration)\n- `frontend/src/components/landing/LandingPage.tsx` (update API endpoint)\n\n### Record\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\n- [ ] I want to work on this issue",

      "comments" : [ "# :wave: Important: PLEASE READ :wave:\n\nThis issue has been labeled as a **good first issue** and is available for anyone to work on.\n\nIf this is your first time contributing to an open source project, some aspects of the development process may seem unusual, arcane, or some combination of both.\n\n1.  **You cannot \"claim\" issues.** People new to open source often want to \"claim\" or be assigned an issue before beginning work. The typical rationale is that people want to avoid wasted work in the event that someone else ends up working the issue. However, this practice is not effective in open source, as it often leads to \"issue squatting\", in which an individual asks to be assigned, is granted their request, and then never ends up working on the issue. Accordingly, you are encouraged to communicate your intent to address this issue, ideally by providing a rough outline as to how you plan to address the issue or asking clarifying questions, but, at the end of the day, we will take running code and rough consensus in order to move forward quickly.\n2.  **We have a very high bar for contributions.** We have very high standards for contributions and expect all contributions???whether new features, tests, or documentation???to be rigorous, thorough, and complete. Once a pull request is merged into stdlib, that contribution immediately becomes the collective responsibility of all maintainers of stdlib. When we merge code into stdlib, we are saying that we, the maintainers, commit to reviewing subsequent changes and making bugfixes to the code. Hence, in order to ensure future maintainability, this naturally leads to a higher standard of contribution.\n\nBefore working on this issue and opening a pull request, please read the project's [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md). These guidelines and the associated [development guide](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/docs/contributing/development.md) provide important information, including links to stdlib's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), license policy, and steps for setting up your local development environment.\n\nTo reiterate, we **strongly** encourage you to refer to our contributing guides **before** beginning work on this issue. Failure to follow our guidelines significantly decreases the likelihood that you'll successfully contribute to stdlib and may result in automatic closure of a pull request without review.\n\nSetting up your local development environment is a critical first step, as doing so ensures that automated development processes for linting, license verification, and unit testing can run prior to authoring commits and pushing changes. If you would prefer to avoid manual setup, we provide pre-configured [development containers](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/tree/develop/.devcontainer) for use locally or in GitHub Codespaces.\n\nWe place a high value on consistency throughout the stdlib codebase. We encourage you to closely examine other packages in stdlib and attempt to emulate the practices and conventions found therein.\n\n-   If you are attempting to contribute a new package, sometimes the best approach is to simply copy the contents of an existing package and then modify the minimum amount necessary to implement the feature (e.g., changing descriptions, parameter names, and implementation).\n-   If you are contributing tests, find a package implementing a similar feature and emulate the tests of that package.\n-   If you are updating documentation, examine several similar packages and emulate the content, style, and prose of those packages.\n\nIn short, the more effort you put in to ensure that your contribution looks and feels like stdlib???including variables names, bracket spacing, line breaks, etc???the more likely that your contribution will be reviewed and ultimately accepted. We encourage you to closely study the codebase **before** beginning work on this issue.\n\n:sparkles: Thank you again for your interest in stdlib, and we look forward to reviewing your future contributions. :sparkles:\n", "hey @kgryte can i work on this issue \n", "Hey @kgryte  I am fixing the issue #8488\n\n", "#8488 i have raised the pr please update @kgryte ", "Hi!

Your help would be very much appreciated! \uD83D\uDC4D \r\n\r\nFeel free to take a try at it and submit a PR. If you have any questions regarding the project structure or need help in setting up your environment let me know and I'll gladly help out.", "Really need this one, allowing users to delete mails in bulk without opening each one and then deleting them one by one.\nI get e-mail newsletters, which get accumulated, making the inbox cluttered AND I'M LAZY enough to push this to a later date.\nReally hoping for a quicker resolution to this issue but I can't be too demanding as a _freeloader_.\n\uD83D\uDE0A", "Hi @lanedirt,\n\nI've begun implementation on the bulk email deletion feature and expect to have a development branch ready for your review soon. Before creating the pull request, I wanted to discuss a few key design points to ensure alignment.\n\n### The API design proposal\n\n\nThe proposed solution utilizes a single endpoint designed for partial success, which prioritizes throughput and client resilience.\n\n#### Contract Models (Shared)\n\nTo facilitate future bulk actions (mark as read/unread, archive), I've created two generic models:\n\n- `EmailBulkRequest`: `List<int>` of email IDs to process.\n- `EmailBulkResponse`:\n  - `successfulEmailIds`: `List<int>` of successfully processed IDs.\n  - `errors`: `Dictionary<int, string>` where the key is the failed ID and the value is the error message.\n\n#### Endpoint Definition\n\n- Method: `DELETE`\n- Path: `/v1/Email/bulk`\n- Request Type: `EmailBulkRequest`\n- Response Type: `EmailBulkResponse`\n\n Sample request:\n\n```json\n{\n \"ids\": [ 1, 2, 3 ]\n}\n```\n\n- Sample response:\n\n```json\n{\n \"successfullEmailIds\": [ 1, 2 ]\n \"errors\": [\n    { \"3\": \"Failed to delete email 3: reason here!\" }\n ] \n}\n```\n####  UI Changes\n\n- Added a checkbox to each row (`EmailRow`).\n- Implemented a \"Delete all selected\" button on the `/emails` action bar, visible only when emails are checked.\n\n----\n\n### Pros & Cons\n\nThis partial-success model offers significant benefits, accepting minor complexity trade-offs:\n\n#### Rationale and Benefits\n\n- Partially Successful Operations: Prevents a single invalid ID from rolling back the entire batch, which enhances throughput and resilience.\n\n- Efficiency in Mobile Environments: Gaining throughput is especially valuable on mobile where initiating multiple connections can be computationally expensive.\n\n- Idempotence and Retries: The detailed response allows clients to safely retry only the failing IDs after an intermittent network or server failure.\n\n#### Concessions and Trade-Offs\n\nWe accept three main drawbacks:\n\n- Server-Side Complexity: The server requires more complex logic to isolate errors within a loop, track the status of each item, and aggregate the comprehensive success/error results. Multiple rounds to the database are expected.\n\n- Client-Side Complexity: The client must always parse the HTTP 200 OK response body to check for errors, instead of simply relying on the status code (like a 204 or 400).\n\n- Protocol Deviation: We are using a request body with the `DELETE` method, which is non-standard. If this is a concern, we can switch the method to `POST /v1/Email/bulk-delete` or another approach.\n\n----\n\n### Open questions\n\n#### SpamOK integration\nI noticed that for the single email deletion we have a [special treatment for emails hosted on SpamOK.com](https://github.com/aliasvault/aliasvault/blob/main/apps/server/AliasVault.Client/Main/Components/Email/EmailPreview.razor#L187-L194), where it calls its API instead of AliasVault one.\n\nI am assuming that for the bulk delete we need to take this in consideration as well, right?\n\nDoes the SpamOK API have a bulk deletion endpoint we can utilize? If so, can you please share the documentation/contract details so I can read it?\n\n#### Feature scope\n\nIs it acceptable for you if we launch this feature first for the `AliasVault.Client` module only?\nWe can track the implementation for the `mobile-app` module under a separate, follow-up issue, if you agree.\n\n\n#### Internationalization (I18n) concerns\n\nI've added new keys keys to the `.resx` files. Could you confirm the workflow for translations? Are you using an AI tool for initial generation, and is there a subsequent human review process to ensure quality?\n\n----\n\nThanks for your guidance on these points.", "Hi @daniloguimaraes, thanks for looking into this!\n\nThanks for the detailed write-up, the approach looks solid overall. A few notes and clarifications below:  \n\n> Does the SpamOK API have a bulk deletion endpoint we can utilize? If so, can you please share the documentation/contract details so I can read it?\n\nNo, SpamOK does not provide a bulk delete endpoint.  Also good to take into account: SpamOK emails are only shown in the credentials page ???recent emails??? block, not on the `/emails` page. This is because SpamOK doesn???t support bulk retrieval either. As the bulk delete functionality only applies to the `/emails` page, SpamOK emails do not have to be taken into account.\n\n> Is it acceptable for you if we launch this feature first for the AliasVault.Client module only?\nWe can track the implementation for the mobile-app module under a separate, follow-up issue, if you agree.\n\nYep, sounds good! We can create separate issues for the other client apps.\n\n> I've added new keys keys to the .resx files. Could you confirm the workflow for translations? Are you using an AI tool for initial generation, and is there a subsequent human review process to ensure quality?\n\nAdding new strings to the `en.resx` files is sufficient. Translations are handled via **Crowdin**, which automatically populates or creates the corresponding `.resx` files for other languages.  \n\n--\n\nAdditional comment for your proposed API response: detailed per-ID errors are not necessary in my opinion. If an email is already deleted or doesn???t exist, that???s fine and shouldn???t be treated as an error.  So a simple `HTTP 200 OK` (or `500` for total failure) is acceptable to me. So this can be simplified. But if you prefer to keep the detailed logging, that???s also fine, I'll leave that up to you.  \n\nThanks again for looking into it. Looking forward to the PR!\n", "Great, @lanedirt . Thanks for the considerations. \uD83D\uDC4D \n\nAnd regarding the detailed per-ID errors response, I gonna drop it and respond with a simple `200 OK`. Less is more \uD83D\uDE04 . If someday we understand that detailed information is needed, them we can revisit it." ],

Some of the example values look like plausibly sensitive information, either by accident or because they were generated in a test environment.\n\nA generic pattern should be adopted and enforced across all documentation to make it abundantly clear what fields are placeholders, ensuring that the users know exactly what to replace, and to reduce the risk of the wrong information being used or perceived.\n\n### Acceptance criteria\n\n- The user should be able to clearly tell when an example has placeholder values\n- The user should be able to tell what the placeholder value is meant to represent\n- The user should not think the placeholder could represent any sensitive production information",

Set up your dev environment [[docs](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/contributing-docs/README.rst)]\n0.5. Go to your `airflow` directory and run `ruff check`.  Write down the number of failures.  Mine currently says 8.  This step is just to make sure it's working and give you a baseline.\n\n1. Open `/airflow/pyproject.toml`\n2. In the `ignore` list (currently starting on [line 301](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/pyproject.toml#L301)) comment out the rule you intend to work on\n3. In a terminal, go to the `airflow` directory and run `ruff check` again.  It should now fail with WAY more errors.  Mine currently says 863.  If the number didn't go way up, something is wrong with your setup.\n4. Have a quick scroll through that list, paying attention to which ones failed because of the rule you just enabled.\n5. Come up with a rough plan to break that down into bites.  Maybe pick one directory that has a bunch of failures and start fixing there.\n6. After you have a handful of fixes done: remove your comment (so it is ignored again) and submit a PR with that chunk of changes (see the Contributing docs in step 0)\n\nPLEASE submit these in many small PRs.  If you do it all at once it will turn into a 3000-line PR and nobody will review it.  Eventually, on the last chunk you'll just remove that line from the ignore list entirely when there are no more violations to fix. \n\n\nLet me know if you need any help, or ask in the Slack server.",

It just have to exists in some header, and only warning you get is one about using a '$' sign in a name. ", "ooof... this is troublesome.  Note this is not limited to just operator(), this could be ANYTHING we generate for lambdas that could be highjacked, including default, copy, and move construction, move/copy assignment, the `__invoke` function, destructor, and function-pointer conversion operators (of which we then have others based on calling convention).\n\nWe have basically 2 options here:\n\n1- Break ABI and change the generated name of our lambdas (and anything else we generate with a '$' in the name).  We could change to `__$_<Num>` instead which is a reserved name in the C languages (note the leading double underscore).  At that point we should ALSO just hard-error on any attempt to name a struct (or perhaps a variable?  Or perhaps ANY identifier?) with a name of that pattern.\n\n2- Names with `$` are implementation defined.  They are pretty common in generated code though, so changing our behavior on them is probably out of the question.  We could just change the 'implementation defined' behavior in this case and just hard-error on any attempt to declare a struct (or variable, or identifer, etc?) with a name that fits the troublesome pattern of `$_<NUMBERS>`.  This is perhaps going to break code for many, as this is perhaps a common pattern.  But the suggestion is that `$_0` would be ill-formed, and `$_0a` would be fine (since it isn't just `$_<NUMBERS>`).\n\n@zygoloid for his opinion.  This is a tough one that I find myself saying \"I need an adult\" on.", "Personally, I think we should take the ABI break in this case, but I don't think we need the hard error on attempts to name a struct with that pattern. Once we're using reserved identifiers, the user deciding to play shenanigans with their identifiers gets what they get because they hit UB when using the reserved identifier. I can live with \"play silly games, win silly prizes\" in that case, but it's less palatable when we're technically using an identifier that is not reserved.", "> Personally, I think we should take the ABI break in this case, but I don't think we need the hard error on attempts to name a struct with that pattern.

I can live with \"play silly games, win silly prizes\" in that case, but it's less palatable when we're technically using an identifier that is not reserved.\n\nI think the hard error is DEFINITELY needed in either case.  The submitter alluded to how this is actually a pretty insidious attack vector (though they have to modify a header file).  Using reserved names is historically a fairly innocuous 'UB', this is a pretty horrifying 'UB', so the diagnostic is incredibly necessary.", "This feels like it could be abused through third party headers and then makes taking over lightly maintained packages a more attractive target.\n\nI would be okay w/ some sort of hard error.", "> 1- Break ABI and change the generated name of our lambdas\n\nI don't think this is a \"real\" ABI break. The Itanium ABI specifies a different mangling (used by Clang) for closure types that may be defined in more than one translation unit. The closure types that use the mangling affected by the current problem do not cross translation unit boundaries.\n\nIndeed, we don't need a new mangling. We can just use the Itanium ABI mangling consistently.", "> > 1- Break ABI and change the generated name of our lambdas\n> \n> I don't think this is a \"real\" ABI break.

That might actually be a pretty trivial fix to this. it might not actually have this problem at all, at the expense of slightly longer names.

      "description" : "\uD83D\uDC23 Good First Issue\nThis issue is reserved for people who have never or only recently contributed to [Hiero](https://hiero.org/) or any open source project in general.\nWe know that creating a pull request (PR) is a major barrier for new contributors.\nThe goal of this issue and all other issues labeled by ['good first issue'](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+org%3Ahiero-ledger+archived%3Afalse+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+) is to help you make your first contribution to Hiero.\n\n\uD83E\uDDE0 Problem\nsrc/hiero_sdk_python/account/account_info.py is the AccountInfo class.\nIt's a key class used in lots of other transactions, such as AccountInfoQuery.\nWe don't have an example for account_info.py likely because sdk users don't tend to use it -- instead we do have examples for AccountInfoQuery, for example.\n\nHowever, sdk developers and AI's might benefit from understanding how to use AccountInfo class, therefore, we can benefit by adding an example to it.\n\n\uD83D\uDCA1 Solution\nAdd examples/account_info.py\n\nExplain how to use the methods in AccountInfo class\n\nThis should demonstrate:\n- [ ] How to manually create an AccountInfo instance (no network calls)\n- [ ] How to populate key fields (account ID, Hbar balance, memo, owned NFTs, etc.)\n- [ ] How to inspect or print the data\n\nWe don???t need an end-to-end example that connects to the Hedera network - because this doesn't really get used in a transaction ??? we just need a lightweight example showing how it works locally. That means we can mock data we need.\n\n\uD83D\uDC69???\uD83D\uDCBB Implementation Steps\n- [ ] Read src/hiero_sdk_python/account/account_info.py to understand the AccountInfo class and its attributes.\n- [ ] Create examples/account_info.py\n- [ ] Import the files you'll be using e.g.\nfrom hiero_sdk_python.account.account_info import AccountInfo\nfrom hiero_sdk_python.account.account_id import AccountId\n- [ ] Implement simple functions like:\n\ndef create_mock_account_id() -> AccountId:\n    \"\"\"Create a mock AccountId.\"\"\"\n    return AccountId.from_string(\"0.0.1234\")\n\ndef create_mock_public_key() -> PublicKey:\n    \"\"\"Generate a random ED25519 public key for demonstration.\"\"\"\n    return PublicKey.generate_ed25519()\n\n\ndef create_mock_balance() -> Hbar:\n    \"\"\"Return a mock account balance.\"\"\"\n    return Hbar(100)\n\n\ndef create_mock_expiration_time() -> Timestamp:\n    \"\"\"Return a sample expiration timestamp (arbitrary future date).\"\"\"\n    return Timestamp(seconds=1736539200)\n\n\ndef create_mock_auto_renew_period() -> Duration:\n    \"\"\"Return a 90-day auto-renew period.\"\"\"\n    return Duration(seconds=7776000)\n\n\ndef create_mock_token_relationship() -> TokenRelationship:\n    \"\"\"Create a sample token relationship with a mock token.\"\"\"\n    token_id = TokenId.from_string(\"0.0.9999\")\n    return TokenRelationship(token_id=token_id, balance=50)\n\ndef build_mock_account_info() -> AccountInfo:\n    \"\"\"Construct a complete AccountInfo instance manually (no network calls).\"\"\"\n    return AccountInfo()..\n\ndef print_account_info(info: AccountInfo) -> None:\n    \"\"\"Pretty-print key AccountInfo fields.\"\"\"\n    print(\"\uD83D\uDCDC AccountInfo Example (Mock Data)\")\n    print(f\"Account ID: {info.account_id}\")...\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Run the AccountInfo example.\"\"\"\n    info = build_mock_account_info()\n    print_account_info(info)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n\n\nUse this as a rough guide - make it as a good as possible!\n\n\uD83E\uDDF0 Requirements\n- [ ] These examples must be able to be run! and must run! uv run examples/account_info.py works\n- [ ] To help you identify if your methods are valid or invalid, please read docs/sdk_developers/pylance.md, and install pylance, this helps you spot errors. Refer to other /examples for each transaction type to see how to do the transactions you need - AI will get it wrong as the python sdk is slightly different to other sdks on the web!\n- [ ] All functions you need to pull and use in this example must be called at the top of your script - make sure the path is correct (see project_structure.md), for example \n\nfrom hiero_sdk_python.tokens.token_associate_transaction import TokenAssociateTransaction\n\n\uD83E\uDDFE To Merge\nIn order for your PR to be able to be merged it needs:\n- [ ] DCO and GPG key signing (git commit -S -s -m \".....\") <- view docs/sdk_developers/signing.md\n- [ ] A changelog entry <-- view docs/sdk_developers/changelog_entry.md\n\nRead CONTRIBUTING.md for more information\n\n??? Acceptance Criteria\n- examples/account_info.py is created\n- examples/account_info.py demonstrates methods in AccountInfo class\n- All existing tests pass\n- CHANGELOG entry added\n- Commits are DCO + GPG signed\n\n\uD83D\uDE4B????????? Next Steps\n- Comment below to be assigned to this issue.\n- Read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-python/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n- Fork the repository and start implementing.\n- When ready, submit your PR!",

      "description" : "## [2.0] Add array, vector overloads to `createVector()` for consistency\n\nCurrently, vector operations often allow vectors to be specified in three ways: separate number arguments, a number array, or a vector instance. For example, `add()`, `sub()`, `mult()`, `div()`, and `rem()` all work this way. Ideally, we would always allow users to specify vectors in the same ways, so they don't need to guess which vector features accept which overloads. We already do this with color features like `fill()` and `stroke()`, which have a consistent set of overloads for specifying colors.\n\n~~If adding array and vector overloads to `createVector()` sounds good, then we might also consider deprecating the `copy()` method, as it would no longer be needed: `v.copy()` could be replaced by `createVector(v)`.~~\n\n**Edit:** We don't plan to deprecate `copy()`. See [this comment](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/issues/8157#issuecomment-3412088907).\n\nTasks:\n- [ ] Reach consensus on adding overloads\n- [ ] Implement and document",

I think `.copy()` maybe has enough of a separate use that it doesn't need to be deprecated though. Because vectors can't use regular math operations and rely on methods, users make extensive use of method chaining. A `.copy()` fits well into the feel of this, and having to wrap something in `createVector(...)` breaks that flow. Also using `createVector(...)` to create a copy, while it makes sense that it should work, feels like a slight indirection from an initial intent of \"I want to create a copy of this object.\" Those are all fairly minor points, but between that and the heavy use of `.copy` in the wild, I'm not sure API simplification alone is strong enough to justify deprecation.

      "description" : "### Problem Statement\n\nWhen??save_interactions??is on in cognee.search, every query produces??CogneeUserInteraction??nodes plus edges such as??used_graph_element_to_answer. Currenlty there???s no easy way to count how often individual graph elements are touched, so we can???t surface frequency weights to downstream retrievers or analytics.\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nBuild a small??memify??pipeline that iterates over recent??CogneeUserInteraction??nodes, tallies usage counts for both the interaction edges and the target nodes, and writes those counts back as properties (e.g.??frequency_weight) via the graph adapters using the same ???get ??? tweak dict ??? add??? contract.\n\n### Alternatives Considered\n\n1. Store the counts in a separate relational table instead of on the graph objects (rejected: harder to keep in sync and add context for retrieval).\n2. Recompute weights on the fly during retrieval (rejected: too slow for every request).\n\n### Use Case\n\nVarious downstream use cases including: ranking frequently referenced entities higher during retrieval, adjusting scoring for completion strategies, and exposing usage metrics in dashboards or audits.\n\n### Implementation Ideas\n\n- Add a new cognee/task that reads??CogneeUserInteraction??nodes, counts how often each node/edge is used, and hands back updates.\n- Make sure that the task can be used in a custom memify pipeline entry, just like the feedback enrichment flow does, so you can run the frequency update end-to-end.\n- Create an e2e example and tests\n- Ensure this works with both kuzu and neo4j backends\n\n### Additional Context\n\n- You can use the feedback_enrichment_minimal_example.py and memify_coding_agent_example.py to understand the patterns needed for a custom memify pipeline implementation\n- Some minor tweaks on adapter level may be necessary, if they turn out to be a blocker creating an implementation that works with one graph engine backend is acceptable while opening a follow up issue for the adapter work on the other backend\n\n### Pre-submission Checklist\n\n- [x] I have searched existing issues to ensure this feature hasn't been requested already\n- [x] I have provided a clear problem statement and proposed solution\n- [x] I have described my specific use case",

      "description" : "**Kibana version:**\n8.x, 9.x\n\n**Describe the bug:**\n\nAn `h2` element is wrapping the panel title when the panel has a description, when not it just uses the panelTitleElement.\n\nhttps://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/b5314276e7299f16b170d91b20ec5e07a52a3160/src/platform/plugins/private/presentation_panel/public/panel_component/panel_header/presentation_panel_title.tsx#L90-L92\n\nhttps://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/b5314276e7299f16b170d91b20ec5e07a52a3160/src/platform/plugins/private/presentation_panel/public/panel_component/panel_header/presentation_panel_title.tsx#L114-L137\n\nThis h2 doesn't own its style, but is inherited. Unfortunately a style override (from a browser extensions for example) at the body/html level could wrongly updates the font-size of this header causing the title to be larger then the required size.\nEUI doesn't block this behaviour and the h2 is not styled to prevent that.\n\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n1. create a dashboard with two panels, one with just the title, the other with title and description\n2. add a custom h2 style with font-size: 40px or more\n3. you will notice that the panel with description increases in font-size.\n\n\n\n**Expected behavior:**\nIt should behave as every other h2 elements aka EuiTitles and it should not be overwritten by custom styles.\n\nAlso the other wrong fact is that it has semantically a different meaning then the title without the description that is just a link or a span if in read-only mode.\n\n\n\n**Screenshots (if relevant):**\n\n<img width=\"876\" height=\"269\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e187377c-5fb1-4e39-b6fb-3d2f7a8bb267\" />\n",

The proposed solution mentioned in the related PR (`#240473` - `fix(dashboard): use EuiTitle for panel title with description`) suggests the correct approach.\n\n### Proposed Simple Solution\n\nThe fix is to change the raw `h2` element wrapping the panel title (when a description is present) to use the correct **`<EuiTitle>`** component with the appropriate size prop (likely `size=\"s\"` or the size that matches the non-description title style). This will ensure:\n\n1.  It inherits the correct EUI styles, preventing external overrides.\n2.  It uses the correct semantic component, improving accessibility and consistency.\n\nI am ready to implement this fix immediately and submit a PR quickly to resolve this style bug. I kindly request that you assign **#239708** to me.\n\nThank you for your consideration!", "Feel free to give it a shot @Ankit-raj-11! :) " ],

      "repositoryName" : "DependencyTrack/dependency-track",
      "description" : "### Current Behavior\n\nWith DT 4.11 and earlier (did not try 4.12 yet), when I clone a project in UI (Add version) or REST API, there are a number of options to clone and re-assign different related aspects such as the set of components that comprised an older project revision, or vuln/policy analysis results.\n\nAlthough the resulting cloned project is populated with a significant inventory of components, which might have originally been from a BOM document upload (at least as far as DT server knows about the original project instance), the `lastBomImport` timestamp and `lastBomImportFormat` original document format of such upload is absent in the clone. \n\nA somewhat smaller loss is the absence of last measurement (vuln/policy alert analysis, if those are replicated) as at least if the project is active - it is instantly re-analyzed as a result of cloning. Still, we already have some answers copied with a timestamp of their last-known-valid date, so this should be carried over (especially if we end up not re-analyzing the clone).\n\nThis is slightly related to issue #4279 (bump in the road of same use-case development).\n\n### Proposed Behavior\n\n* When we clone a project and select to `includeComponents` and/or `includeServices`, replicate also the `lastBomImport` timestamp and `lastBomImportFormat` \"BOM Format\" information (if present)\n* When we clone a project and select to `includeAuditHistory` and/or `includePolicyViolations`, replicate also the \"Last Measurement\" timestamp (if present)\n* UPDATE: I am not sure if there is currently a counter (or other knowledge source) of how many times a BOM was uploaded into this project instance -- how many development iterations left their trail in the KPI history changes (like component/service headcounts, among other things) -- but such information should be replicated likewise.\n  * As I suggested in https://owasp.slack.com/archives/C6R3R32H4/p1729678695970759 it might make more sense to track it as a new column in `PROJECTMETRICS` with a copy of BOM's own UUID (I think it is a required piece of content), so also linking the project instance to an actual original document that may be checked in the artifact storage. Then every change of this field (as a BOM gets uploaded) would cause the relevant KPI snapshot to appear, and a `COUNT()` of this `PROJECT_ID` and unique BOM UUIDs would yield the count of BOMs iterated here. By side effect, it would keep timestamps of when each BOM document was uploaded (earliest time-ranged metrics entry with the new UUID).\n    * Replication via `includeAuditHistory` might automagically take care of cloning the data needed for \"BOM upload count\" in this case.\n    * If this does require new development, feel free to log it as a separate ticket, and keep in mind this one if there would be new \"BOM upload count\" fields to replicate e.g. in the project entry itself.\n  * BTW, I see that the table already includes a `COMPONENTS` count, but don't see a `SERVICES` one, if it matters (our project has little use for it yet, but it may be due to ignorance).\n\n### Checklist\n\n- [x] I have read and understand the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#filing-issues)\n- [x] I have checked the [existing issues](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/issues) for whether this enhancement was already requested\n",

As part of flow after https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/99612 or Health Report telling you indices are flagged stagnant on migrations.\n\nAs part of this, I'd like if CAT Shards would report columns \n- the shard's index's [`index.routing.allocation.include._tier_preference` setting](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/elasticsearch/index-lifecycle-actions/ilm-migrate) used by ILM\n- the shard's node's roles in short form\n\nIn practice, I usually flag via an aggregated view and then review a table of what'd be the above similar output. For example when cold backs up warm backs up hot:\n- <img width=\"588\" height=\"161\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a6c921b-ab93-46c3-8c69-b52f528a595b\" /> \n- <img width=\"600\" height=\"216\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ded97ee9-934f-492b-8e5f-47113f3b1047\" />\n\nTIA!

You are more than welcome to give it a try \uD83D\uDE42. I'll assign the issue to you.\n\nHere are some tips to get you started:\n- For adding the `node.role` column, I'd advise looking at the `_cat/nodes` API, as that API already includes that column. That API defines the column here: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/c3c9d2fe53a355801dc225269a553c9b1e23cd78/server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/rest/action/cat/RestNodesAction.java#L177-L180 and adds the cell value here: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/c3c9d2fe53a355801dc225269a553c9b1e23cd78/server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/rest/action/cat/RestNodesAction.java#L442\n- I don't think we have any prior art for adding the tier preference column, but you should be able to retrieve the setting value from this settings object: `state.getState().metadata().getProject().index(shard.index()).getSettings()`.\n\nUnfortunately this is all the help I can provide for now. If you're able to get something working, feel free to open a PR, and we'll have a look at it. Otherwise, perhaps you can have a look at another issue \uD83D\uDE42." ],

It has good browser support and would allow us to marginally reduce the bundle size.\n\n---------------\n\n_Do not alter or remove anything below. The following sections will be managed by moderators only._\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n\n* Use of `cloneDeep` within the codebase should be replaced with `structuredClone`.\n\n## Implementation Brief\n\n* Wait until we upgrade our version of Node to at least `17` (probably `18`), see #6026.\n* Replace every import of `cloneDeep` with `structuredClone`, eg `cloneDeep( object )` to `structuredClone( object )`.\n* At the time of writing, we have usage in the following files:\n  * `assets/js/modules/analytics-4/datastore/properties.test.js`\n  * `assets/js/modules/analytics-4/components/module/ModulePopularPagesWidgetGA4/index.js`\n  * `assets/js/modules/analytics-4/components/dashboard/DashboardAllTrafficWidgetGA4/UserCountGraph.js`\n  * `assets/js/modules/analytics-4/components/dashboard/DashboardAllTrafficWidgetGA4/UserDimensionsPieChart.js`\n  * `assets/js/modules/analytics-4/utils/data-mock.js`\n  * `assets/js/modules/reader-revenue-manager/components/settings/SettingsEdit.stories.js`\n  * `assets/js/modules/reader-revenue-manager/datastore/publications.test.js`\n  * `assets/js/components/GoogleChart/utils.js`\n  * `assets/js/components/wp-dashboard/WPDashboardPopularPagesGA4.js`\n  * `storybook/utils/resetGlobals.js`\n\n### Test Coverage\n\n* Tests should continue to pass without change; no new tests are needed.\n\n## QA Brief\n\n* <!-- One or more bullet points for how to test that the feature works as expected. -->\n\n## Changelog entry\n\n* <!-- One sentence summarizing the PR, to be used in the changelog. -->\n",

      "comments" : [ "# :wave: Important: PLEASE READ :wave:\n\nThis issue has been labeled as a **good first issue** and is available for anyone to work on.\n\nIf this is your first time contributing to an open source project, some aspects of the development process may seem unusual, arcane, or some combination of both.\n\n1.  **You cannot \"claim\" issues.** People new to open source often want to \"claim\" or be assigned an issue before beginning work. The typical rationale is that people want to avoid wasted work in the event that someone else ends up working the issue. However, this practice is not effective in open source, as it often leads to \"issue squatting\", in which an individual asks to be assigned, is granted their request, and then never ends up working on the issue. Accordingly, you are encouraged to communicate your intent to address this issue, ideally by providing a rough outline as to how you plan to address the issue or asking clarifying questions, but, at the end of the day, we will take running code and rough consensus in order to move forward quickly.\n2.  **We have a very high bar for contributions.** We have very high standards for contributions and expect all contributions???whether new features, tests, or documentation???to be rigorous, thorough, and complete. Once a pull request is merged into stdlib, that contribution immediately becomes the collective responsibility of all maintainers of stdlib. When we merge code into stdlib, we are saying that we, the maintainers, commit to reviewing subsequent changes and making bugfixes to the code. Hence, in order to ensure future maintainability, this naturally leads to a higher standard of contribution.\n\nBefore working on this issue and opening a pull request, please read the project's [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md). These guidelines and the associated [development guide](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/docs/contributing/development.md) provide important information, including links to stdlib's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), license policy, and steps for setting up your local development environment.\n\nTo reiterate, we **strongly** encourage you to refer to our contributing guides **before** beginning work on this issue. Failure to follow our guidelines significantly decreases the likelihood that you'll successfully contribute to stdlib and may result in automatic closure of a pull request without review.\n\nSetting up your local development environment is a critical first step, as doing so ensures that automated development processes for linting, license verification, and unit testing can run prior to authoring commits and pushing changes. If you would prefer to avoid manual setup, we provide pre-configured [development containers](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/tree/develop/.devcontainer) for use locally or in GitHub Codespaces.\n\nWe place a high value on consistency throughout the stdlib codebase. We encourage you to closely examine other packages in stdlib and attempt to emulate the practices and conventions found therein.\n\n-   If you are attempting to contribute a new package, sometimes the best approach is to simply copy the contents of an existing package and then modify the minimum amount necessary to implement the feature (e.g., changing descriptions, parameter names, and implementation).\n-   If you are contributing tests, find a package implementing a similar feature and emulate the tests of that package.\n-   If you are updating documentation, examine several similar packages and emulate the content, style, and prose of those packages.\n\nIn short, the more effort you put in to ensure that your contribution looks and feels like stdlib???including variables names, bracket spacing, line breaks, etc???the more likely that your contribution will be reviewed and ultimately accepted.

UMD_THROW(\"That won't work\") or UMD_FATAL(\"Grayskull is on fire\").  On exceptions, if we're going to use them then I think we should be explicit in interface documentation what methods can throw and why.",

The missing variant selector causes boxen to miscalculate the display width when centering the title.\n\n## Solution\n\nAdd the emoji variant selector U+FE0F to force emoji presentation:\n\n```diff\n- '??? NO TASKS AVAILABLE ???'\n+ '?????? NO TASKS AVAILABLE ??????'\n```\n\nThe variant selector is an invisible character that changes the bytes from `e2 9a a0` to `e2 9a a0 ef b8 8f`, forcing emoji rendering and fixing boxen's width calculation.\n\n## Affected Components\n\nAll warning signs (`???`) used throughout the CLI need the variant selector added:\n- Box titles (2 instances)\n- Warning display utility (1 instance)\n- Auth command warnings (4 instances)\n- Show command warnings (1 instance)\n- Autopilot warnings (1 instance)\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- Box title lines align perfectly with the rest of the box borders\n- All warning emojis render consistently as emoji presentation\n- Visual consistency across all Task Master UI elements",

      "comments" : [ "<!-- Answer -->\nTo address the readability issue of tooltips in your Country Map visualization, consider implementing these targeted improvements:\n\n1. **Customize Tooltip Styles**: Adjust the tooltip's CSS to enhance contrast and readability. Use a light background (`#fff`), dark text (`#000`), and ensure the font size is clear (`14px`). Style the tooltip to be slightly transparent (`opacity: 0.9`) and follow the cursor without blocking it (`pointer-events: none`).\n\n2. **Dynamic Tooltip Positioning**: Make sure the tooltip dynamically adjusts its position based on the mouse coordinates. This prevents it from obscuring important parts of the map or UI elements.\n\n3. **Enhance Tooltip Content and Formatting**: Dynamically generate tooltips with concise, well-formatted content. Include the country name and metric value, ensuring the text contrasts well with the background for better readability.\n\n4. **Interactive Tooltips for Enhanced Readability**: For complex data, consider making tooltips interactive, allowing users to click or hover over the tooltip itself for more interaction.\n\n5. **Accessibility Considerations**: Ensure tooltips are accessible by adding `aria` attributes and enabling keyboard navigation.\n\n6. **Leverage D3.js Features**: Use D3.js to dynamically update tooltip content and style based on the data of the hovered map region.\n\n7. **Adopt Theme Consistency**: Align the tooltip's styling with the map's overall theme for a cohesive look and feel.\n\nBy focusing on these enhancements, you can significantly improve the user experience and readability of tooltips in your choropleth country map visualizations.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n<details>\n<summary>\n\n#### Details\n</summary>\n\n**Sources**\n- [superset-frontend/plugins/legacy-plugin-chart-world-map/src/WorldMap.js](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset-frontend/plugins/legacy-plugin-chart-world-map/src/WorldMap.js)\n- [superset-frontend/plugins/legacy-plugin-chart-country-map/src/CountryMap.js](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset-frontend/plugins/legacy-plugin-chart-country-map/src/CountryMap.js)\n- [superset-frontend/plugins/legacy-plugin-chart-country-map/src/ReactCountryMap.jsx](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset-frontend/plugins/legacy-plugin-chart-country-map/src/ReactCountryMap.jsx)\n- [superset-frontend/plugins/legacy-preset-chart-nvd3/src/utils.js](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset-frontend/plugins/legacy-preset-chart-nvd3/src/utils.js)\n- [superset-frontend/plugins/plugin-chart-echarts/src/utils/tooltip.ts](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset-frontend/plugins/plugin-chart-echarts/src/utils/tooltip.ts)\n- [superset-frontend/plugins/legacy-plugin-chart-country-map/src/CountryMap.css](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset-frontend/plugins/legacy-plugin-chart-country-map/src/CountryMap.css)\n- [superset-frontend/plugins/legacy-plugin-chart-country-map/src/controlPanel.ts](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset-frontend/plugins/legacy-plugin-chart-country-map/src/controlPanel.ts)\n- [superset/viz.py](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset/viz.py)\n\n<br/>\n\n**About Dosu**\nThis response is meant to be useful and save you time.

      "url" : "https://github.com/processing/p5.js/issues/8214",
      "repositoryName" : "processing/p5.js",
      "description" : "### Problem\nThe documentation defines the concept of _heading_ for 2D vectors specifically.\n\n* In 1.x, there are no true 2D vectors, in that `z` is always defined. As a result, `heading()` produces output for fully 3D vectors, even when `z` is nonzero. It also produces output for ???1D??? vectors, since `createVector(1)` could be used as a shortcut for `createVector(1, 0)`.  \n* In 2.x, we have an opportunity to resolve these unintended quirks.\n\n### Solution\nSupporting only 2D input and adding errors for other dimensions would allow the simplest and clearest feature specification, and it???s how users expect this feature to be used. This could be considered a bug fix: users who accidentally provide a 3D vector can now be notified of this mistake, rather than silently allowing it. In practice, it appears that this change would cause zero (or near zero) disruption.\n\n### Disruption estimate: 0%\nI used the Google search phrase `site:https://editor.p5js.org/ \"createVector\" \"heading\"` to find 50 sketches using the `heading()` method. Zero of them would break if we were to implement the proposed solution.\n\n(I did exclude a few sketches, meaning I didn???t count them toward the numerator or denominator. One case used 4D vectors in 1.x, which is not supported, and the sketch appeared to be broken already. I also excluded three sketches that used `createVector()` with zero arguments somewhere in their heading calculations, since it???s not 100% clear what effect this will have in 2.x. But [the goal is to prevent errors](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/issues/8156#issuecomment-3429392581) from arising in this case.)\n\n### Blocking issues (foundational issues for all of `p5.Vector`)\nIf you're interested in helping to move the current issue along, you can add a comment on the current issue to indicate whether you support the proposed solution. After that, you could add a comment on the following issues to indicate whether you support the proposals they contain, along with a brief rationale.\n\n* [#8153](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/issues/8153): Consensus would clarify the meaning of 2D. In 1.x, this meant $z=0$, but according to the proposal, in 2.x it'd mean the vector has exactly two defined elements (this would resolve an inconsistency with the current implementations of `.z` and `toString()`).\n* [#8155](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/issues/8155): Consensus on a user-facing API for checking dimension size would enable a more stable implementation of `heading()`. Adding a comment on the current leading proposal (`.shape`), either in support of the proposal or against it, would be helpful. The exact format of this API depends on the outcome of an ongoing review of getter/setter patterns in p5, so any comments can focus on the \"shape\" concept.",

Suppose I'm trying to estimate a 1D position `x`, via a general `x_t = x_{t-1} + delta * v` schema. Each position on the 1D line has a feature vector. I have some beacons on the 1D line (I know perfectly the position). I observe the feature vector of the position I'm really in, and I know how similar it is to each feature vector of the beacons. I want to model the fact that if the feature is very similar to the one at beacon `i`, I probably am very close to beacon `i`, and so it seemed to me that placing a normal at each beacon position and doing a NormalMixture would be what I need. Am I way off topic?\r\n\r\n</div>",

Unit/Integration Tests\nImplement unit tests for all helper functions and utilities related to API request preparation, response parsing, and error handling.\n\nImplement integration tests that simulate calls to the actual OpenAI endpoints (e.g., `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/responses`). These tests should cover successful responses and various failure scenarios.\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- Implement robust support for optional request/response properties.\n\n- Improve streaming support for individual agents: Refactor the streaming logic to provide a smoother and more granular experience when an agent's response is streamed. This should include better differentiation and handling of streamed chunks belonging to different parts of the agent's reasoning or output.\n",

      "description" : "**Background**\nUsers do not notice that once load package gets into a pipeline it is stuck there - until loaded or discarded. In a notebook environment it seems more intuitive that after an exception pending packages are deleted. Here we do not change this behavior but we'll make it really obvious what is going on\n\n**Requirements**\nPR 1:\n1. our primary warning should be improved (let's do it, it is cheap). right now we are warning only if package is stuck in load step. let's warn for all pending packages so:\n```py\n# normalize and load pending data\n        if self.list_extracted_load_packages():\n            self.normalize()\n        if self.list_normalized_load_packages():\n            # if there were any pending loads, load them and **exit**\n            if data is not None:\n                logger.warn(\n                    \"The pipeline `run` method will now load the pending load packages. The data\"\n                    \" you passed to the run function will not be loaded. In order to do that you\"\n                    \" must run the pipeline again\"\n                )\n            return self.load(destination, dataset_name, credentials=credentials)\n```\nshould instead use `self.has_pending_data` to issue a warning and get into the execution branch above\n2. In the load and normalize step exception handler, check if there's any pending data and warn user in the error message that this happen (we are adding similar check to workspace dashboard). NOTE: extract state will not create pending packages on failure!\n3. Make sure this warning stands out - starts on separate line, see how it looks in a notebook\n\nThe warning should explain\n- that the package is left in the pipeline and that it will be loaded on the next run and any new data to extract will be ignored\n- if there are any pending packages in load state (`list_normalized_load_packages`) that are partially loaded (is_package_partially_loaded) warn that data in the destination was modified and we recommend to retry loading or manual pipeline inspection (look for `def _display_pending_packages()` that shows this warning in cli.)\n- explain how to remove pending packages. you can use command line, or `pipeline.drop_pending_packages()` or `pipeline.drop()` which will reset the local working folder fully\n\n\nPR 2:\nif `refres=\"drop_sources\" is used we can actually drop all pending packages with sources from extract step. in that case\n- we skip checking for pending packages and proceed with extract\n- we inspect schema names in the newly extracred packages\n- we delete all old pending packages with schema names as above\n- we can add this behavior to documentation\n\n------\nroot cause:\n\n### dlt version\n\n1.17.1\n\n### Describe the problem\n\nI applied a schema contract to a source to prevent schema changes. Everything worked as expected while the contract was in place.\n\nHowever, when I tried to change the contract to evolve the schema (for example, to add a new column), the pipeline failed with an error stating that the schema is frozen and cannot be modified.\n\nChanging the schema contract setting from\n\n`schema_contract = \"freeze\"`\n\nto\n\n`schema_contract = \"evolve\"`\n\ndoes not resolve the issue, the schema remains locked, and the pipeline cannot evolve as expected.\n\nIn other words, once a schema contract is set to \"freeze\", there seems to be no way to unfreeze or modify the schema afterward.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nafter changing the configuration from schema_contract = \"freeze\" ??? schema_contract = \"evolve\" the schema should unlock and allow controlled evolution again.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nGoogle Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Z2SuA8sKyqzye3dcLq0Na2wS9-IdLTaT#scrollTo=5q82qCe4kYRH\n\n### Operating system\n\nLinux\n\n### Runtime environment\n\nGoogle Colab\n\n### Python version\n\n3.12\n\n### dlt data source\n\n_No response_\n\n### dlt destination\n\nDuckDB\n\n### Other deployment details\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_",

We'd want to update this later to process our submission\n    onSubmit: values => {\n      alert(JSON.stringify(values, null, 2))\n    },\n  })\n  \n  return (...)\n}\n```\n\nThen we???ll use formik in our form to manage our data\n\n```jsx\n// imports\nimport Button from '@mui/material/Button' // For our form submit button\n\nexport default function App() {\n const formik = useFormik({\n   //no changes here\n })\n \n return (\n   <LocalizationProvider dateAdapter={AdapterDayjs}>\n      {/* Ensure we can see our form value changes on submission */}\n      <form onSubmit={formik.handleSubmit}>\n        <DatePicker\n          // link our value to formik\n          value={formik.values.date}\n          // And update it when our value changes\n          onChange={(date: Dayjs) => formik.setFieldValue('date', date)}\n        />\n        <Button color='primary' variant='contained' fullWidth type='submit'>\n          Submit\n        </Button>\n      </form>\n    </LocalizationProvider>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nAnd that???s all we need for a working form! \uD83C\uDF89\n\n### Enhancing with validation\n\nIt???s important to validate your forms and guide users, so you probably want to add some validation\n\nFirst we???ll need to add some state management for our error into our `useFormik` hook\n\n```jsx\nexport default function App() {\n  const formik = useFormik({\n    initialValues: {\n      date: null as Dayjs | null,\n    },\n    // add our validate rule to check if the date is in the future\n    validate: values => {\n      const errors: Record<string, string> = {}\n\n      if (values.date && values.date.isAfter(new Date())) {\n        errors.date = 'Date must be in the past'\n      }\n\n      return errors\n    },\n    onSubmit: values => {\n      alert(JSON.stringify(values, null, 2))\n    },\n  })\n\n  return (\n    // same as before\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThen we can link our state management to our DatePicker to ensure when something doesn???t go as planned, the user is notified.\n\n```jsx\n// imports\n\nexport default function App() {\n  // our error handling and useFormik hook\n  \n  return (\n   <LocalizationProvider dateAdapter={AdapterDayjs}>\n      <form onSubmit={formik.handleSubmit}>\n        <DatePicker\n          value={formik.values.date}\n          onChange={(date: Dayjs) => formik.setFieldValue('date', date)}\n          // Restrict the frontend so users can't select future dates\n          disableFuture\n          // and display an error if they manage to input a future date anyway\n          slotProps={{\n            textField: {\n              helperText: formik.errors.date,\n            },\n          }}\n        />\n        <Button color='primary' variant='contained' fullWidth type='submit'>\n          Submit\n        </Button>\n      </form>\n    </LocalizationProvider>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nAnd that???s it! You should now have a form that allows date selection, with validation, built using formik.\n\n### Final Code\n\n```jsx\nimport { useFormik } from 'formik'\nimport Button from '@mui/material/Button'\nimport { Dayjs } from 'dayjs'\nimport { DatePicker, LocalizationProvider } from '@mui/x-date-pickers'\nimport { AdapterDayjs } from '@mui/x-date-pickers/AdapterDayjs'\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const formik = useFormik({\n    initialValues: {\n      date: null as Dayjs | null,\n    },\n    validate: values => {\n      const errors: Record<string, string> = {}\n\n      if (values.date && values.date.isAfter(new Date())) {\n        errors.date = 'Date must be in the past'\n      }\n\n      return errors\n    },\n    onSubmit: values => {\n      alert(JSON.stringify(values, null, 2))\n    },\n  })\n\n  return (\n    <LocalizationProvider dateAdapter={AdapterDayjs}>\n      <form onSubmit={formik.handleSubmit}>\n        <DatePicker\n          value={formik.values.date}\n          onChange={(date: Dayjs) => formik.setFieldValue('date', date)}\n          disableFuture\n          slotProps={{\n            textField: {\n              helperText: formik.errors.date,\n            },\n          }}\n        />\n        <Button color='primary' variant='contained' fullWidth type='submit'>\n          Submit\n        </Button>\n      </form>\n    </LocalizationProvider>\n  )\n}\n\n```", "Here's the react-hook-form version\n\nAs I was working on this one I realised that I should probably be using the form libraries built-in validation so I'll come back and fix the formik one via edits\n\nEdit: The formik example is now updated to use the formik error management\n\n- [x] Formik\n- [ ] React Final Form\n- [x] React Hook Form\n\n---\n\n## React Hook Form\n\n### Initial setup\n\nFirst you???ll want to install react-hook-form\n\n```bash\nnpm install react-hook-form\n```\n\nIf you haven???t already, make sure to also [[install MUI X](https://mui.com/x/react-date-pickers/getting-started/#installation)](https://mui.com/x/react-date-pickers/getting-started/#installation)\n\n```bash\nnpm install @mui/x-date-pickers dayjs @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled\n```\n\nNext you???ll want to follow the datepicker install [[instructions for MUI X](https://mui.com/x/react-date-pickers/getting-started/#installation)](https://mui.com/x/react-date-pickers/getting-started/#installation) until you have a functioning datepicker \n\n```jsx\nimport { AdapterDayjs } from '@mui/x-date-pickers/AdapterDayjs';\nimport { LocalizationProvider } from '@mui/x-date-pickers/LocalizationProvider';\nimport { DatePicker } from '@mui/x-date-pickers/DatePicker';\n\nexport default function FirstComponent() {\n  return (\n    <LocalizationProvider dateAdapter={AdapterDayjs}>\n      <DatePicker />\n    </LocalizationProvider>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nNow we can expand this to work with react-hook-form\n\nFirst we want to add the `useForm` hook that allows us to control our form, and our `onSubmit` function that tells the form what to do when a submit event occurs.\n\n```jsx\n// other imports\nimport { useForm, Controller, SubmitHandler } from 'react-hook-form'\n\n// define our form input types\ntype Inputs = {\n  date: Dayjs | null\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const { control, handleSubmit } = useForm<Inputs>()\n  const onSubmit: SubmitHandler<Inputs> = data => alert(data)\n  \n  return (...)\n}\n```\n\nIf you???re familiar with react-hook-form you may be used to using the register method, which you???ll notice we???re not using here. To integrate with external UI libraries, react-hook-form instead exposes a `control` method ([link](https://react-hook-form.com/get-started#IntegratingControlledInputs)) which allows us to pass the data used by react-hook-form to its children.\n\nNow we can add our controlled DatePicker\n\n```jsx\n// imports\nimport Button from '@mui/material/Button' // For our form submit button\n\nexport default function App() {\n // Everything here stays the same\n \n return (\n   <LocalizationProvider dateAdapter={AdapterDayjs}>\n      {/* We add a handleSubmit function */}\n      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>\n        {/* A controller component wraps our DatePicker to pass it the appropriate props */}\n        <Controller\n          name='date'\n          control={control}\n          render={({ field: { onChange, value } }) => (\n            // And we pass value and onChange to our DatePicker, which are managed by react-hook-form\n            <DatePicker value={value} onChange={onChange} />\n          )}\n        />\n        <Button color='primary' variant='contained' fullWidth type='submit'>\n          Submit\n        </Button>\n      </form>\n    </LocalizationProvider>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nAnd now you can submit your form and see the date being sent! \uD83C\uDF89\n\n### Enhancing with validation\n\nIt???s important to validate your forms and guide users, so you probably want to add some validation\n\nWe can use react-hook-form???s validation to assist us with our state management, but we???ll need to make a few changes to use it.\n\n```jsx\n// imports & 'Inputs' type declaration\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const {\n    control,\n    handleSubmit,\n    // extract our errors from the useForm hook\n    formState: { errors },\n  } = useForm<Inputs>()\n  const onSubmit: SubmitHandler<Inputs> = data => alert(JSON.stringify(data))\n\n  return (...)\n}\n```\n\nNow we can access any errors, we need to capture that something went wrong\n\n```jsx\n\nexport default function App() {\n  //\n\n  return (\n    <LocalizationProvider dateAdapter={AdapterDayjs}>\n      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>\n        <Controller\n          name='date'\n          control={control}\n          {/* Add a rule that checks if the date is in the past, and send an error message of 'disableFuture' if not */}\n          rules={{ validate: value => (value && value.isBefore() ? undefined : 'disableFuture') }}\n          render={({ field: { onChange, value } }) => (\n            <DatePicker \n              value={value} \n              onChange={onChange}\n              // Add 'disableFuture' to our frontend validation to prevent users selecting incorrect dates\n              disableFuture \n              // And add in a message that tells users where they went wrong if an error appears\n              slotProps={{\n                textField: {\n                  helperText: errors.date?.type === 'validate' && errors.date?.message === 'disableFuture' && 'Selected date must be in the past'\n                },\n              }} \n            />\n          )}\n        />\n        <Button color='primary' variant='contained' fullWidth type='submit'>\n          Submit\n        </Button>\n      </form>\n    </LocalizationProvider>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nAnd that???s it! You should now have a form that allows date selection, with validation, built using react-hook-form.\n\n### Final code\n\n```jsx\nimport { useForm, Controller, SubmitHandler } from 'react-hook-form'\nimport Button from '@mui/material/Button'\nimport { Dayjs } from 'dayjs'\nimport { DatePicker, LocalizationProvider } from '@mui/x-date-pickers'\nimport { AdapterDayjs } from '@mui/x-date-pickers/AdapterDayjs'\n\ntype Inputs = {\n  date: Dayjs | null\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const {\n    control,\n    handleSubmit,\n    formState: { errors },\n  } = useForm<Inputs>()\n  const onSubmit: SubmitHandler<Inputs> = data => alert(JSON.stringify(data))\n\n  return (\n    <LocalizationProvider dateAdapter={AdapterDayjs}>\n      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>\n        <Controller\n          name='date'\n          control={control}\n          rules={{ validate: value => (value && value.isBefore() ? undefined : 'disableFuture') }}\n          render={({ field: { onChange, value } }) => (\n            <DatePicker \n              value={value} \n              onChange={onChange} \n              disableFuture \n              slotProps={{\n                textField: {\n                  helperText: errors.date?.type === 'validate' && errors.date?.message === 'disableFuture' && 'Selected date must be in the past'\n                },\n              }} \n            />\n          )}\n        />\n        <Button color='primary' variant='contained' fullWidth type='submit'>\n          Submit\n        </Button>\n      </form>\n    </LocalizationProvider>\n  )\n}\n\n```", "And here's one for React Final Form\n\n- [x] Formik\n- [x] React Final Form\n- [x] React Hook Form\n\n---\n\n## React Final form\n\n### Initial setup\n\nFirst you???ll want to install React Final Form\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save final-form react-final-form\n```\n\nIf you haven???t already, make sure to also [[install MUI X](https://mui.com/x/react-date-pickers/getting-started/#installation)](https://mui.com/x/react-date-pickers/getting-started/#installation)\n\n```bash\nnpm install @mui/x-date-pickers dayjs @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled\n```\n\nNext you???ll want to follow the datepicker install [[instructions for MUI X](https://mui.com/x/react-date-pickers/getting-started/#installation)](https://mui.com/x/react-date-pickers/getting-started/#installation) until you have a functioning datepicker \n\n```jsx\nimport { AdapterDayjs } from '@mui/x-date-pickers/AdapterDayjs';\nimport { LocalizationProvider } from '@mui/x-date-pickers/LocalizationProvider';\nimport { DatePicker } from '@mui/x-date-pickers/DatePicker';\n\nexport default function FirstComponent() {\n  return (\n    <LocalizationProvider dateAdapter={AdapterDayjs}>\n      <DatePicker />\n    </LocalizationProvider>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nNow we can expand this to work with React Final Form\n\nFirst we want to add our `onSubmit` function so that we can see our results\n\n```jsx\n// other imports\nimport { Form } from 'react-final-form'\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const onSubmit = (values: { date: Dayjs }) => alert(JSON.stringify(values, null, 2))\n  \n  return (...)\n}\n```\n\nThen we can add the Final Form wrapping component around our DatePicker\n\n```jsx\n//imports\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const onSubmit = (values: { date: Dayjs }) => alert(JSON.stringify(values, null, 2))\n  \n  return (\n    <LocalizationProvider dateAdapter={AdapterDayjs}>\n      {/* We wrap our form with a Final Form component to handle our state */}\n      <Form\n        onSubmit={onSubmit}\n        initialValues={{ date: null }}\n        render={({ handleSubmit, form, values }) => (\n          // This manages our submit state which we pass to our form element\n          <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n            // It also manages our state which we pass to our DatePicker component\n            <DatePicker\n              value={values.date}\n              onChange={(date: Dayjs) => form.change('date', date)}\n            />\n            <Button color='primary' variant='contained' fullWidth type='submit'>\n              Submit\n            </Button>\n          </form>\n        )}\n      />\n    </LocalizationProvider>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nAnd that???s it!

      "description" : "\uD83D\uDC23 Good First Issue: Standardize Test File Naming\n\nThis issue is reserved for people who have never or only recently contributed to [Hiero](https://hiero.org/)\n or any open source project in general.\nWe know that creating a pull request (PR) can be a major barrier for new contributors.\nThe goal of this issue and all other issues labeled ['good first issue'](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+org%3Ahiero-ledger+archived%3Afalse+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+)\n is to help you make your first contribution to Hiero.\n\n\uD83D\uDC7E Problem\n\nSome of our test files currently use inconsistent naming patterns:\n\nUnit tests: some files start with test_ (e.g., test_my_account.py) and some end with _test (e.g., my_account_test.py).\n\nIntegration tests: almost all use the _test postfix (e.g., account_allowance_e2e_test.py).\n\nThis inconsistency makes it harder to write a workflow that enforces test file naming, and leads to extra complexity in CI.\n\n\uD83D\uDCA1 Solution\n\nWe should standardize all test files in tests/unit and tests/integration to use the _test.py postfix.\n\nCurrent name | New name\n-- | --\ntest_account_allowance_approve_transaction.py | account_allowance_approve_transaction_test.py\ntest_my_account.py | my_account_test.py\n\nPlease skip renaming the following helper/config files:\n\n__init__.py\n\nconftest.py\n\nmock_server.py\n\nutils_for_test.py\n\n\n\n\uD83D\uDCA1 Implementation Steps\n\n- [ ] Rename unit test files in tests/unit to follow the _test.py postfix convention.\n\n- [ ] Rename integration test files in tests/integration to follow the _test.py postfix convention (if not already).\n\n- [ ] Make sure the test imports still work after renaming.\n\n- [ ] Verify that all tests still run and pass after renaming.\n\n\n\n\uD83D\uDC69???\uD83D\uDCBB Requirements to Pass\n\n - [ ] All tests run successfully after renaming.\n\n - [ ] Each commit is GPG and DCO signed: git commit -S -s -m \"...\"\n\n\n(See docs/sdk_developers/signing.md\n)\n\n - [ ] Add a changelog entry in UNRELEASED:\n(See docs/sdk_developers/changelog_entry.md\n)\n\n\uD83D\uDCDD Next Steps\n\n- [ ] Comment below that you???d like to work on this issue.\n\n- [ ] Wait to be assigned by a maintainer.\n\n- [ ] Fork the repository and follow the instructions in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-python/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n to start making your changes.\n\n- [ ] Use the [README.md](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-python/blob/main/README.md)\n for guidance on running tests locally.\n\nThank you for helping make Hiero more consistent and maintainable! \uD83D\uDEE0???\n",

But i agree that we need some sort of directive that would remove the need to do this way.\r\n", "I think I have the same problem:\r\n\r\nInside a `<mat-form-field />`, I have a custom component `<app-companies-select />` which contains `<mat-select matInput />`. \r\nbut I still have the `mat-form-field must contain a MatFormFieldControl` error, because `mat-form-field` only checks for `MatFormFieldControl` in its direct children and not all descendants.", "Bumped into my own problem yet again...\r\n\r\nI found this old talk which goes over the problem some what.\r\nbut I still feel a material specific guide would be a good idea.\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/CD_t3m2WMM8?t=1522", "Some working example if you need: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75850069/how-to-wrap-custom-angular-material-control-into-own-component\r\n", "This particular problem is the reason I can not recommend to use angular material for any large scale project.\r\n\r\nCustom material control is ridiculously complex when you need to wrap well known element like input. Even if done right still dies not solve all the problems since you probably want another wrapper around whole form-field stuff.\r\n\r\nI have examples where I implemented all of the mentioned solutions like custom control value accessor or just passing the control inside a wrapping component.\r\n\r\nNothing works as a complete solid experience that whole form in single place gives you.\r\nWith above solutions you can defeat the mat-errrors and relations between form-field and input.\r\n But you will still loose relation with <form> so for instance submitting errored form will not highlight controls., because mat-form-fields are nit aware of dirtiness. You need some fancy custom error strategy or propagate the form state to each wrapping control yourself.\r\n\r\nControls and buttons are two main things require redesign to make material compatible in flexibility to any other design system solution out there in the market.\r\nClear guide is a bare minimum starting point here.", "@atakchidi may I ask you what UI component library would you recommend instead of Angular material?

", "Bumped into this yet again, 3 years later. \uD83D\uDE05\n\nCould someone from the team please add a guide on how we can wrap a mat-select or mat-input and create a form control that works with form-fields.\n\nI cannot be the only one who want to have custom form controls with reusable logic?", "Not a perfect example, but I wrote something related to same issue couple of years back: https://blog.shhdharmen.me/creating-a-custom-form-field-control-group-using-angular-material", "I've solved this problem by just injecting `NgControl` and lifting out `AbstractControl` from it through `ngControl.control`. If you pass that control down to the nested component, you do not need to reimplement `ControlValueAccessor` inside the wrapping component. The wrapped component will hook up its own `ControlValueAccessor` to the injected control.\n\nIt's a bit verbose, so at least in my projects, I've created a mixin `mixinPropagateFormControl` that I can use in components for any propagation (like `PasswordComponent` -> `InputComponent`)." ],

Since the integration tests were moved to internal/, I've few possible ways to  re-expose them.\n\n1. Moving the integration tests back to a public pkg/, this will restores the original behavior making the tests accessible to external users again...\n2. Creating a new public test utility package that wraps the internal tests which allows more controlled access while keeping internals hidden.\n3. Providing a CLI tool or Docker Container for Integration testing, works for non Go users as well but requires additional setup. \n4. If exposing the tests isn't ideal, we could guide users on how to manually validate their storage plugins also this wouldn't fully restore the old behavior but might be an easier workaround.\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts on which approach makes the most sense. Let me know what direction I should take!", "I have a potentially different direction. Since the only way to implement 3rd party storage for jaeger is via grpc remote api, we don't actually need to expose any code, we only need to expose a test binary that will run the test against a provided grpc endpoint. This technically does not require any changes in jaeger because 3rd party can still clone the repo and run the test the same way we run it, just start their own remote storage. ", "Hey @yurishkuro , thanks for the clarification!\n\nSo instead of re-exposing the tests, external users can simply clone the Jaeger repo and run the test suite against their own gRPC storage backend???no changes needed in Jaeger itself.\n\nWould this require any additional setup or documentation updates for third-party storage providers? Also, should we add a script to simplify running these tests, or is the current workflow sufficient?", "Documentation wouldn't hurt, I don't recall what's currently documented. I don't think a script is needed, because integration tests can be run simply as `go test {path}`. It should be documented.", "We're currently implementing a grpc storage plugin, and the approach with a tests helper function exposed from jaeger go package itself like before (used by jaeger-clickhouse and currently provided in the docs) would be much more convenient, as cloning external repos in a closed CI circuits is unsafe and unstable (e.g. reliant on network).", "We have no plans to re-open the code to be importable, it was a lot of effort to break external dependencies from OTEL on Jaeger, which was never meant to be used as a library. There is an issue #7055 to update documentation. I still think the best bet for supporting external storage testing is to build a binary that will invoke the internal test code.", "I believe the best way to provide tests is in the same way as the interface itself. Might be a good idea to extract the proto, codegen and test suite into a separate repo with an exported public package. https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-idl seems like a good fit.", "It's not the best for the project, having tests in another repo is a lot more friction for regular development, can't even commit tests and behavior in the same PR." ],

      "description" : "### Describe the bug\n\nI2C is not functional on the Infineon XMC4700 relax kit. \n\n**Diagnose:** \nWhen using the default I2C settings (coming from the board's devicetree), we get the following error: \n```bash\n[00:00:05.436,000] <err> i2c_infineon_xmc4: Invalid I2C bit rate value          \n[00:00:05.436,000] <err> i2c_infineon_xmc4: Unsupported speed \n```\nIf `clock-frequency` is set (in a DT overlay for example), then I2C is functional.\n\n**Regression:**\nI did not run a git bisect; but based on the commit log of the i2c_ifx_xmc4.c driver, the faulty commit is:\ncommit 16c40b16f3ffbc2cabb8d43f8824840aecaa95da . This is a (long standing) regression.\n\n\n### Regression\n\n- [x] This is a regression, but it only impacts the Infineon XMC4 boards.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. enable I2C shell with a hello world for instance. \n2. run an i2c scan: \n```bash\ni2c scan usic48020200 \n```\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```shell\n[00:00:05.436,000] <err> i2c_infineon_xmc4: Invalid I2C bit rate value          \n[00:00:05.436,000] <err> i2c_infineon_xmc4: Unsupported speed\n```\n\n### Impact\n\nAnnoyance ??? Minor irritation; no significant impact on usability or functionality.\n\n### Environment\n\nHost OS: Linux/Fedora\nZephyr: v4.2\nToolchain: 0.17.4 \n\nProblem is present since Zephyr v3.5.\n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_",

This can be resolved solely looking at the code (!)\nBut I have one on my desk, so can do the testing. \nOf course if you can get easily your hand on such a kit, it's also great. \n\nHere some hints for the investigation:\n- where does the error coming from?\n- where is the bitrate initialized?\n- problem occurs when clock-frequency (property of I2C controller) is not explicitly set. \n- Check the default value set for bitrate when clock-frequency is not set / double check is the i2c controller binding file the expectation fro clock-frequency.\n- submit a PR\n\nHope this helps!

Could you please assign it to me?\n\nThanks!" ],

      "description" : "### Environment (optional)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe the feature\n\nThe current ``deepinv.utils.plot`` function only supports two normalization modes before plotting:\n- per-image min???max rescaling\n- clipping between [0, 1]\n\nHowever, in many real world applications (for instance tomography), images must be plotted using a shared absolute scale. The plot utility should support a shared color scale.\n\nThe current implementation only allows for individual rescales, which makes it unusable for most real-world evaluation or publication purposes. Here's a simple example showing how different the plots can look:\n```python\nimport deepinv as dinv\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nx = dinv.utils.load_example(\"butterfly.png\", img_size=(128, 128), grayscale=True)\nphysics1 = dinv.physics.PoissonNoise(gain=1 / 5)\nphysics2 = dinv.physics.PoissonNoise(gain=1 / 100)\n\ny1 = physics1(x)\ny2 = physics2(x)\n\nprint(y1.min(), y1.max())\nprint(y2.min(), y2.max())\ndinv.utils.plot(\n    [x, y1, y2],\n    titles=[\"Ground-truth image\", \"Noisy measurement 1\", \"Noisy measurement 2\"],\n    figsize=(10, 4),\n)\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(10, 4))\nvmin = min(x.min().item(), y1.min().item(), y2.min().item())\nvmax = max(x.max().item(), y1.max().item(), y2.max().item())\n\nim0 = axes[0].imshow(x.squeeze(), cmap=\"gray\", vmin=vmin, vmax=vmax)\naxes[0].set_title(\"Ground-truth image\")\naxes[0].axis(\"off\")\n\nim1 = axes[1].imshow(y1.squeeze(), cmap=\"gray\", vmin=vmin, vmax=vmax)\naxes[1].set_title(\"Noisy measurement 1\")\naxes[1].axis(\"off\")\n\nim2 = axes[2].imshow(y2.squeeze(), cmap=\"gray\", vmin=vmin, vmax=vmax)\naxes[2].set_title(\"Noisy measurement 2\")\naxes[2].axis(\"off\")\n\nplt.tight_layout()\n\nplt.show()\n```\nOutput:\n\n<img width=\"1077\" height=\"860\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae9f480c-693b-4fc6-ae72-269ca6efdf25\" />\n\n### Motivation\n\nMany of the deepinv users work on quantitative applications where units matter, and they can't use our plotting function for their plots.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

Please describe.**\nWhen editing or adding tasks on the frontend, it???s hard to remember which items were modified locally but not yet synced with the backend (CLI). This can cause confusion about what???s already pushed and what???s still pending.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\n1. Whenever a task is added or edited on the frontend:\n2. Mark it visually with an icon, color tag, or subtle indicator (e.g., \uD83D\uDFE1 dot, ?????? symbol, or ???unsynced??? badge).\n3. These indicators clearly show which items have been modified on the frontend but not yet synced.\n4. After a successful sync with the backend, CCSync should reset all these indicators, so the user knows everything is now synced and clean.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\n1. Keeping track mentally (error-prone).\n2. Relying on timestamps (not intuitive in UI).\n\n**Additional context**\n1. Could be implemented as a small visual overlay or CSS class change on task cards/lists.\n2. Optionally, hovering over an unsynced task could show ???Pending sync?????? tooltip.\n\n**Impact**\nImproves developer and user clarity at a glance, one can see what???s new or modified locally.\nMakes syncing feel transparent and reliable, especially during active development cycles.",

Paste the copied term into the terminal _(or simply, interact with the terminal in any way),_ then paste again, and observe  that the clipboard item has been overwritten by your previous search term from the terminal.\n\nTo clarify: pasting action is not necessary to lose clipboard contents, it is simply for repro purposes. In real life scenarios, any interaction with the Terminal pane can replace clipboard if terminal search field is open and populated.\n\nThe way I see it, is that searching highlights found items (in terminal pane), and this highlighting acts as if user has selected something, hence copy-on-select is triggered and clipboard is replaced with the found / highlighted string.\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/052fe079-3c7c-4c21-b36b-fd113ba0377d",

You're welcome to give us a hand and try fix it if you're passionate.", "@Tyriar @movy Hi, I???d like to take a shot at fixing this issue, could you assign it to me.", "@vidmt sure, here's some code pointers:\n\n- Find widget https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/src/vs/workbench/contrib/terminalContrib/find/browser/terminalFindWidget.ts\n- The setting that causes problems: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/34096fd36a95893177bcee7a6f8fbc5fc4d7493d/src/vs/workbench/contrib/terminal/common/terminalConfiguration.ts#L151-L155", "If @vidmt steps away from the issue, I'd love to take a swing at it!", "I'm not sure if this bug exist.\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/467e4a4b-a724-438c-b1af-e5ae303d4a42\n\nAre you @movy sure you have `terminal.integrated.copyOnSelection` to false on both user and workspace setting? \n\nIf you have `terminal.integrated.copyOnSelection` enabled, then its expected that your highlighted term in terminal will be copied.\n", "@anthonykim1, \nMy `terminal.integrated.copyOnSelection` has been set to `true` for 25 years, but the way it is supposed to work is it _copies on selection_, i.e. user selected text -> it is copied to the clipboard, and it works as expected in VSCode terminal pane.\n\nThis issue is about unwanted behaviour when **highlighted** text (by search item) gets copied even when user does not select anything. If you select something, then paste it, selection gets deselected, i.e. it is certainly not the issue here.\n\nI am not familiar with the codebase, and while it feels like it is related to `terminal.integrated.copyOnSelection`, the **selection is being triggered by search item** IS the unwanted behaviour, and `copyOnSelection` just works as expected in such unexpected scenario.", "I am on Windows using Zsh, i tried exactly what you did but it seems everything works correctly i would assume then its macOS related bug.\nI will try to fix that problem.", "I believe I understand where to fix this bug but am unsure of the best approach.\n\nWhen the Find Widget is open and a search result is highlighted, any user action that causes a terminal state change (like typing or pasting) often causes the last search term to be selected and triggers the xterm.raw.onSelectionChange event. This event causes the unwanted search highlight to be copied to the clipboard, overwriting the user's intended content.\n\nThe ideal fix requires distinguishing between a user-initiated selection (which should be copied) and a programmatic selection (the search highlight, which should be ignored). A viable fix is to guard the copy action by checking the selection's origin. My proposed conditional for the TerminalClipboardContribution looks like this:\n```\n\n// Inside TerminalClipboardContribution.xtermReady() onSelectionChange handler\nxtermReady(xterm: IXtermTerminal & { raw: RawXtermTerminal }): void {\n\t\tthis._xterm = xterm;\n\t\tthis._register(xterm.onDidRequestCopyAsHtml(e => this.copySelection(true, e.command)));\n\t\tthis._register(xterm.raw.onSelectionChange(async () => {\n\t\t\tif (this._configurationService.getValue(TerminalSettingId.CopyOnSelection)) {\n\t\t\t\tif (this._overrideCopySelection === false) {\n\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t\t\t}\n// ------------------------------------------  new code ------------------------------------------------------------ \n\t\t\t\tconst isFindWidgetVisible = this._contextKeyService.getContextKeyValue('terminalFindVisible');\n\n\t\t\t\t// isSelectionFromUser() not implemented. is there a simple way to get this? maybe using xterm?\n\t\t\t\tif (isFindWidgetVisible && this._ctx.instance.hasSelection() /* && isSelectionFromUser()*/) {\n\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t\t\t}\n// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\t\t\t\tif (this._ctx.instance.hasSelection()) {\n\t\t\t\t\tawait this.copySelection();\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}));\n\t}\n\n```\n\nWhat i wanted to ask was is there a simple or idiomatic way, perhaps using a feature of xterm.js or the existing VS Code terminal wrappers, to determine if a selection event from xterm.raw.onSelectionChange was created by a user's mouse/keyboard action versus a programmatic action (like a search highlight re-assertion)?\n\nI am looking for a concept similar to isSelectionFromUser()", "Hi @Tyriar  and @anthonykim1 ,\n\nI submitted a PR to fix this issue: [#276641](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/276641)???. The change ensures that the terminal find highlight does not overwrite the clipboard when CopyOnSelection is enabled.\n\nThe PR includes a guard in TerminalClipboardContribution to block programmatic selections from the find widget while preserving normal copy-on-selection behavior.\n\nAny feedback or review would be greatly appreciated. thank you!", "Hello I implemented a fix for the terminal copy-on-selection issue on Windows/macOS. Submitted PR #276734 for review", "> Hello I implemented a fix for the terminal copy-on-selection issue on Windows/macOS. Submitted PR [#276734](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/276734) for review\n\nHey @souhil25 ??? I think your change blocks all selections while the find widget is open, even user ones. The goal is just to block selections triggered by the find widget itself." ],

      "description" : "Extracted from code review comment:\n\n![medium](https://www.gstatic.com/codereviewagent/medium-priority.svg)\n\nUsing `new Date().getTime()` for Server-Sent Event (SSE) IDs is not guaranteed to produce unique IDs, especially if multiple events are generated within the same millisecond. This could lead to issues with clients that rely on unique event IDs. According to the SSE specification, the `id` field should uniquely identify the event, which is crucial for features like resuming connections.\n\nA more robust approach would be to use a counter initialized before the `try` block (e.g., `let eventId = 0;`) and increment it for each event. This change should also be applied on line 63.\n\n_Originally posted by @gemini-code-assist[bot] in https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-js/pull/162#discussion_r2489784306_\n            ",

I often see this as a common questions for devs new to the space - \"how does authentication work on Ethereum\"? They often (reasonably) bring mental models from web2 & want to understand how Ethereum users \"sign in\".\r\n\r\nThere's some existing resources when Googling \"ethereum authentication\" but the 1st result is this:\r\nhttps://moralis.io/ethereum-authentication-full-tutorial-to-ethereum-login-programming/\r\nWhich I don't think is a great neutral resource, as it just pushes the user to create an account & use Moralis vs. actually explaining how things work & what options a developer has when adding authentication.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nCreate a new documentation page (perhaps under the \"Ethereum stack\" section) that covers how authentication works in an Ethereum context. This could be a fairly simple resource, explaining that this is typically handled by connecting an Ethereum wallet to an application via a client library like ethers.js, web3.js or Wallet Connect.\r\n\r\nAs part of this explanation it may be worth getting into how wallets & accounts work (i.e. the public-private key cryptography that allows users to sign messages proving control of an account).\r\n\r\nThis could also be a useful page to list emerging standards & best practices, like Sign in with Ethereum:\r\n- https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361\r\n- https://auth0.com/blog/sign-in-with-ethereum-siwe-now-available-on-auth0/\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nPerhaps we should also/instead add a page covering \"Ethereum wallets\", which we have an existing page on but not for developers who want to learn how wallets work & how they add wallet support to a software application.\r\n\r\n**Want to contribute?**\r\n\r\nWe love contributions from the Ethereum community! Please comment on an issue if you're interested in helping out with a PR.\r\n",

Introduction\n- Explain how authentication in Web3 differs from traditional Web2 logins.\n- Highlight that Ethereum users prove identity by **signing with a private key** instead of using passwords.\n- Clarify the distinction between **connecting a wallet** and **authenticating a session**.\n\n\n## 2. Wallets, Accounts, and Signatures\n- **Ethereum Accounts:** How public/private key pairs define identity.\n- **Wallets:** Tools for key management and message signing.\n- **Digital Signatures:** How users prove control of an address without exposing private keys.\n- Quick code example: signing a message with `ethers.js` or `web3.js`.\n\n## 3. Connecting a Wallet vs. Authenticating a User\n- **Connecting:** Grants dApps access to a public address (no proof of ownership yet).\n- **Authenticating:** User signs a message to verify they control the connected address.\n- Illustrate how these two steps differ in purpose and security.\n\n## 4. How Ethereum Authentication Works (Step-by-Step)\n**Client-side flow:**\n1. User connects wallet (e.g., MetaMask, WalletConnect).\n2. App requests a nonce from backend.\n3. Wallet prompts user to sign the nonce.\n\n**Server-side flow:**\n4. Server verifies the signature.\n5. If valid, create a secure session (e.g., JWT or cookie).\n6. User is now authenticated.\n\n## 5. ???Sign-In With Ethereum??? (SIWE) Standard\n- Introduce **EIP-4361** and its purpose.\n- Why SIWE matters:\n  - Improves wallet UX and user safety.\n  - Standardizes message formats to avoid phishing.\n- Show a sample SIWE message.\n- Mention libraries and resources i find " ],

Refer to other /examples for each transaction type to see how to do the transactions you need - AI will get it wrong as the python sdk is slightly different to other sdks on the web!\n- [ ] All functions you need to pull and use in this example must be called at the top of your script - make sure the path is correct (see project_structure.md), for example \n\nfrom hiero_sdk_python.tokens.token_associate_transaction import TokenAssociateTransaction\n\n\uD83E\uDDFE To Merge\nIn order for your PR to be able to be merged it needs:\n- [ ] DCO and GPG key signing (git commit -S -s -m \".....\") <- view docs/sdk_developers/signing.md\n- [ ] A changelog entry <-- view docs/sdk_developers/changelog_entry.md\n\nRead CONTRIBUTING.md for more information\n\n??? Acceptance Criteria\n- examples/account_allowance_nft.py is deleted\n- examples/account_allowance_approve_transaction_nft.py exists\n- examples/account_allowance_delete_transaction_nft.py exists\n- Files run successfully against Hedera Testnet\n- Functionality and good stuff about account_allowance_nft is preserved\n- All existing tests pass\n- CHANGELOG entry added\n- Commits are DCO + GPG signed\n\n\uD83D\uDE4B????????? Next Steps\n- Comment below to be assigned to this issue.\n- Read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-python/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n- Fork the repository and start implementing.\n- When ready, submit your PR!",

Remove `torch._scaled_mm` from the benchmarking and just compare it to the bf16/torch.mm method\n2.

      "description" : "What?\nDuring work [on](https://github.com/azukds/tubular/issues/488), it became apparent that this transformer is doing quite a lot. The outcome of this issue was to add a separate transformer focused on extracting raw numeric datetime  values, like dt.month.\n\nThis new transformer does call into question whether DatetimeInfoExtractor needs to be maintained, as it now doesn't provide much new functionality over the new transformer followed  by MappingTransformer. It mainly just provides easy access to some common mappings for the outputs of the new transformer. \n\nMy suggestion is that we move the default mappings out of DatetimeInfoExtractor and deprecate, and include a deprecation warning that directs users to replace this transformer with the new transformer followed by MappingTransformer using the default datetime mappings.\n\nWhy?\nstreamline package\n\nHow?\nsee above, will be dependant on the linked issue",

Ideas may be:\r\n\r\n- Baseline: Experiment with full context for all recursive functions in the termination category (disabling the autotuner that disables interval and interval set contexts in recursive calls)\r\n- A flavor of context gas (#1340) that starts out with full context and then switches to no-interval in context for recursive procedures\r\n- A dedicated construction to always unroll recursion k-deep (via contexts) where k could, e.g., be a function of the magnitude of the argument given to procedures identified as recursive (might capture quite a few SV-COMP style tasks).\r\n- ...\r\n\r\nThese are quite disconnected from everything else, and could, e.g., be given to Master's students.",

      "description" : "### Current behaviour\n\nControls are currently fixed to \"forwards\" style. That's fine for most users, but if a vehicle [is reversible](https://discuss.bluerobotics.com/t/reverse-rov-controls-in-qgc/11932) it can be convenient to reverse the controls.\n\nThat's technically already possible via a workaround, by duplicating a functions mapping and swapping just the desired axes, but then it's awkward to swap between them (they need to open the joystick configuration to do so, instead of just pressing a button), swapping mappings is currently [confusing](https://github.com/bluerobotics/cockpit/issues/1824), there's needless extra work to keep the button mappings in sync, and it loses the user a mapping set.\n\n### Expected or desired behaviour\n\nAdd a \"reverse\" Action, to reverse the user's motion control inputs:\n\n1. A minimal implementation could just directly reverse all the axis mapping ranges except for Z, although there may be some confusion if that change is persistent across reboots.\n2. To make it more configurable the reversing status could be defined by a boolean data-lake variable (with optional value persistence?), which would then also integrate nicely with #1759, in future development.\n    - Variables can be toggled, or controlled as momentary switches (e.g. while holding a joystick button), which opens some additional usage possibilities\n    - This has the side benefit that it could be used to trigger an automatic switch between Views (e.g. to one with a rear-facing camera as the main display), via a custom Action\n3. If we want to provide more control to the user we could allow them to select which axes are \"reversible\", as part of the joystick configuration interface.\n    - This perhaps lends itself more into expansion to areas like [dynamic axis switching](https://discuss.bluerobotics.com/t/is-custom-dynamic-axis-switching-possible/12459)\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- [x] I have checked to make sure that a similar request has not already been filed or fixed.",

Send touch event from, at least, our winit backend.  (Qt and Linuxkms will have to support them as well enventually)\n 4. The flickable can use the flag in `MouseEvent` to do something different\n 5.

      "description" : "### Apache Airflow Provider(s)\n\ngit\n\n### Versions of Apache Airflow Providers\n\n_No response_\n\n### Apache Airflow version\n\n3.0.2\n\n### Operating System\n\nUbuntu 20.04.6 LTS\n\n### Deployment\n\nVirtualenv installation\n\n### Deployment details\n\n_No response_\n\n### What happened\n\nWhen using GitDagBundle with `supports_versioning=True`, Airflow DAG Processor fails to execute DAG callbacks because it cannot find the materialized code under `versions/<commit_hash>/`.\n\nOnly the tracking_repo/ folder is updated with the latest version, but when a DAG-level callback (e.g. `on_success_callback`, `on_failure_callback`) is triggered, the callback request sent to the DAG Processor points to the versioned folder (e.g. `/dag-bundles/git_xxx/versions/<commit_hash>/dag.py`), which does not exist by default.\n\nThis leads to a failure in the DAG Processor when trying to load the DAG from the file. Specifically, inside `DagFileProcessor._execute_dag_callbacks`, the following code fails:\n`dag = dagbag.dags[request.dag_id]  # returns empty\n`\n\nThis happens because `dagbag.process_file()` cannot find the DAG file at the specified path (versions/<commit_hash>/...), and so the DAG is never loaded, and the callback is silently skipped.\n\n### What you think should happen instead\n\nThe DAG Processor should also materialize the correct version of the DAG source code (i.e., clone the Git repository to the appropriate `versions/<commit_hash>` path) before attempting to load and execute DAG-level callbacks.\n\n\n\n### How to reproduce\n\n1. Use GitDagBundle with supports_versioning=True.\n2. Define a DAG-level `on_failure_callback` or `on_success_callback`.\n3. Deploy a new Git version and trigger a DAG run that invokes the callback.\n4. The DAG tasks execute successfully.\n5. But DAG callback fails because the path in the callback request is under versions/<commit_hash>/, which is not materialized\n6. As a workaround, we patched GitDagBundle.refresh() to also clone the repo into the `versions/` directory.\n\n### Anything else\n\nIn our environment, DAGs are triggered via Asset, but this should not affect the behavior.\n\n### Are you willing to submit PR?\n\n- [x] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n",

No coding skills needed.\r\n2. Awareness of Kubernetes.\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\n1. **Identify a Kubernetes sample app**\r\n    1. Bring your own Kubernetes manifest or Helm Chart or Docker Compose file or...\r\n    3. ...or identify a sample app from any available in public repos ([example 1](https://github.com/AdminTurnedDevOps/kubernetes-examples), [example 2](https://github.com/kubernetes/examples), [example 3](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes-engine-samples)).\r\n    1. Attempt to identify resources that can benefit both newcomers and seasoned professionals.\r\n1. **Import Kubernetes App**\r\n    1. Import the sample application using import modal present in toolbar, [following this guide](https://docs.meshery.io/extensions/importing-a-design). \r\n1. **Publish Kubernetes App**\r\n    1. Publish your sample app into the Meshery Catalog. Guides: Using Meshery UI or [Using MeshMap](https://docs.meshery.io/extensions/publishing-a-design).\r\n1. **[Optional] Open App in Playground**\r\n    1. Access [Meshery Playground](https://play.meshery.io) and open your app in [MeshMap](https://docs.meshery.io/extensions/meshmap).\r\n1. **[Optional] Share your Kubernetes App**\r\n    1. Be social and share your imported apps on twitter or linkedin and the Meshery project accounts will repost.\r\n1. **Repeat**\r\n    1. Import and publish five or more sample apps.\r\n\r\n## Acceptance Criteria\r\n1. Five or more new sample apps have been imported into Meshery and published into the Meshery Catalog.\r\n\r\n---\r\n### Contributor [Guides](https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing) and [Handbook](https://layer5.io/community/handbook)\r\n- \uD83D\uDEE0 [Meshery Build & Release Strategy](https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/build-and-release)\r\n- \uD83D\uDCDA [Instructions for contributing to documentation](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#documentation-contribution-flow)\r\n   - Meshery documentation [site](https://docs.meshery.io/) and [source](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/tree/master/docs)\r\n- \uD83C\uDFA8 Wireframes and designs for Meshery UI in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/SMP3zxOjZztdOLtgN4dS2W/Meshery-UI)\r\n- \uD83D\uDE4B\uD83C\uDFFE\uD83D\uDE4B\uD83C\uDFFC Questions: [Discussion Forum](http://discuss.meshery.io) and [Community Slack](https://slack.meshery.io)\r\n",

      "description" : "### Description\n\nOne of the most common errors when starting a Hydra Head with a group of friends is the `cluster ID mismatch`, which comes about through a misconfiguration, by one or more parties, of either their: peer list, or, their `--advertise` parameter.\n\nThere are other ways where people can _intend_ to start a Head, but fail due to misconfiguration (i.e. one of them used the wrong contestation period).\n\nThese mismatches are hard tedious to diagnose.\n\n### Suggested solution\n\nWe could revamp the configuration process into two parts:\n\n1. A shared config file with (almost) all shared information, protocol parameters, and _every_ peer (including all of your own) information, as well as the relevant files relative to some directory\n2. A tiny amount of command-line arguments that: selects which peer you are; sets the basepath location for the files specified in the config.\n\nThen there would never be a need to gain agreement on args; you would always just check if you have the exact same config file (and the corresponding files in the relevant directory.)\n\n### Alternative\n\n- Let our users struggle.\n- Have an endpoint that exposes the list of options and can be used to help others configure (including reading all files into literal values)\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Todo\n\n- [ ] When all peers are specified (including yourself) work out how to distinguish yourself from others, so you don't try and connect to yourself\n- [ ] Decide which params we can put in this config file\n- [ ] Decide rough format of the file\n- [ ] Decide which (absolutely minimal) set of args we keep on the command-line\n- [ ] Decide what we want to do regarding backwards-compatibility",

Now depending on the online-type:\n  * Direct Cardano: share `--mainnet` or `--testnet-magic` directly.\n  * Blockfrost: there???s not much to share here, as they don???t prevent users from failing due to configuration mismatches.\n> Note that we already expose the ledger protocol parameters via GET /protocol-parameters, which should be used to configure `--ledger-protocol-parameters` for online mode.\n\nWith the above, the envisioned user journey to configure a hydra-node to join a party would be:\n\n1. **One participant acts as the initiator**, collecting all peers information and member verification keys (still through other means).\n2. The **initiator starts their node** with the desired mode and configuration. From this point, they can either submit the `init` transaction for others to observe or, in offline mode, specify the `--initial-utxo`.\n3. **Other participants start their nodes** using their own local configurations (e.g. `--api-host`, `--monitoring-port`, `--node-socket`, `--persistence-dir`, `--hydra-signing-key`, `--cardano-signing-key`, `--listen`), along with a new configuration flag:\n\n   * `--initiator`, which specifies the initiator???s `<host>:<port>` value.\n4. **Using the newly `--initiator` configuration**, each node queries the initiator on startup to retrieve the configuration being used, including all peer information and verification keys as JSON objects (instead of files).\n5. These **queries must be signed** using the peer???s signing key, allowing the initiator to verify the request and accept it only if it comes from a trusted party.\n6. Last but not least, note that the initiator is the responsible to assign the `node-id` configuration for each participant, possibly depending on their cardano or hydra verification-key.\n\nThis approach allows each participant to start their node with minimal local configuration and ensuring configuration consistency across all parties while reducing friction and potential errors.\n\nFinally, to support restarts (especially if the initiator goes offline), the node must obtain the party verification keys from its known `HeadParameters` (which are available upon observing `HeadInitialized`) and query the already-initialized etcd cluster to get all its peer information.\n\n> Lastly, it???s worth noting that the `--start-chain-from` configuration will be overridden with the latest observed tick persisted by each participant. This prevents a restarting node from catching up from a point too far in the past, instead resuming from the latest trusted observed state.\n\n?????? Note: This approach represents a major refactor of our node start-up module.\n", "Very interesting idea @ffakenz .\n\nIn my opinion it's a bit too wild of a readjustment, insofar as it introduces a kind of centrality that I don't exactly think is favourable; but happy to discuss with the team at some point. Perhaps it's worth isolating your idea as it's _own_ independent issue, because it's quite a different thing, even though it does address the same problem?" ],

It seems that this is caused by having long non-wrapable text in the `st.code`. We could fix this in a few different ways:\n1. Moving the copy button into the toolbar we use elsewhere \n2. Adding some padding such that the content never overlaps the copy button\n3. Adjust the zIndex and background color of the copy button such that it wins the overlapping fight.\n\n@jrieke what do you think?", "Hm yeah this is tricky:\n\n1. Toolbar might be a good option to unify this a bit more, even though it could seem like a bit of overkill for just this single button that in most cases works fine. Would probably need to see this in practice to check if it looks good. We could also have the toolbar but move it down a bit so it's inside the code block (basically same position as today). \n2. We did have that in the past at some point I think, but I never really liked it, because it created and unnaturally big padding for every code block. \n3. I tried that at some point but getting the background color right is tricky. We do also use the same code block in e.g. `st.exception` to show stacktraces, which has a red background. I couldn't figure out how to make it gray in one case and red in the other, but maybe there is a solution! \n\n\nSo I think I'd probably try out 1, and if that's not good, go for 3. Probably not the most urgent issue to invest a lot of time into though...", "Hi everyone! \uD83D\uDC4B I???m new to open-source contributions and would love to take this issue as my first one. Could someone please share the exact steps or example code snippet to reproduce the overlap problem? That would really help me get started and test possible fixes.\n\nThanks a lot!\n" ],

Similar to the one from the docs\n2. Passing a longer password which should should not show the error\n3. Setting the value of the password on the input instead of passing it\n\nI would expect all 3 test cases to be successful, but the 2nd one fails.\n\n### Environment\n\n```\n  System:\n    OS: Windows 11 10.0.26200\n    CPU: (28) x64 13th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-13850HX\n    Memory: 23.19 GB / 63.66 GB\n  npmPackages:\n    @vue/test-utils: ^2.4.6 => 2.4.6\n    vitest: ^3.2.4 => 3.2.4\n    vue: ^3.5.22 => 3.5.24\n```\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

This would provide additional context and updates about the company alongside the bug reports.\n\n## Technical Details\n\n**Files you'll likely work with:**\n- **View:** `website/views/organization.py` (specifically the `DomainDetailView` class)\n- **Template:** `website/templates/domain.html`\n- **Documentation:** `website/documents/BltCompanyDashboard.md`\n- **Models:** You may need to check `website/models.py` to see if there's a News model, or you might need to integrate with an external news API\n\n## Possible Implementation Approaches\n\n1. **External News API Integration** - Fetch news about the company from external news APIs (like NewsAPI, Google News, etc.)\n2. **Manual News Entry** - Create a News model and allow admins to add news items manually\n3. **RSS Feed Integration** - Pull news from company RSS feeds or press release pages\n\n## What Makes This a Good First Issue\n\n- Clear scope: Add one new feature to an existing page\n- Well-documented: The dashboard already has comprehensive documentation\n- Good learning opportunity: You'll work with views, templates, and possibly external APIs\n- Has a bounty: $5 reward upon completion\n\nWould you like me to help you plan out the implementation approach or clarify any specific aspect of the issue?", "/assign", "Hello @Sidhant185!

      "description" : "It's been over 10 years now that Godot has been developed in the open, with code contributions from 2,800 users.\n\nThe total count of people who helped build Godot is actually far greater, as it should include documentation writers, testers, bug reporters, translators, moderators, content creators, users doing community support or talking at events, folks making games that credit Godot visibly, everyone supporting the project financially, and many other types of contributions which I can't keep enumerating.\n\nAll these people brought Juan and Ariel's little-engine-that-could from this:\n\n![Screenshot of the isometric 2D demo in Godot 1.0](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/713fc73e-65ff-45f3-8ef2-e3f364355656)\n*Screenshot of the isometric 2D demo in Godot 1.0.*\n\nTo this:\n\n![Screenshot of PVKK: Planetenverteidigungskanonenkommandant in Godot 4.3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/671ce7d3-8955-44b1-9fab-90a641e44ffc)\n*Screenshot of [PVKK: Planetenverteidigungskanonenkommandant](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2956040/PVKK_Planetenverteidigungskanonenkommandant/) in Godot 4.3.*\n\nThat's no small achievement, so I encourage all contributors to take a minute to contemplate the progress that we've made together over this journey so far!\n\nAmidst the daily churn of fixing issues, reviewing PRs, making releases, etc., it's important to remind ourselves of where we are, and how we got there.\n\n![GIF of Cozy Space Survivors where asteroids form the word \"GO???DOT\"](https://forum.godotengine.org/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a5a0d1684cdd56cda6371b13f34f4b97811c1284.gif)\n*GIF of [Cozy Space Survivors](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2657850/Cozy_Space_Survivors/) where asteroids form the word \"GO???DOT\".*\n\n## Some stats about Godot usage on GitHub\n\nBetween our usual traditions of either [making silly jokes](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/10000) or [sharing some inspiring stats](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/30000) for round issue numbers, I picked the latter for this 100,000th issue[^1], and wanted to look a bit closer at our issue and PR numbers over time.\n\nA lot of people coming to Godot's repository to see over 10,000 open issues and 3,000 open PRs might rightfully wonder whether this is normal, or a sign of a maintenance issue.\nI will make the case that it is a bit of both :)\n\n### Issues\n\n![Graph showing issue count over time](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a62a11c0-6df3-4527-b433-9687400eda04)\n*Visualization from OSS Insight showing issue count over time, [see the interactive version](https://ossinsight.io/analyze/godotengine/godot#issue-history).*\n\nThe two accumulated curves show the total number of issues created over the lifetime of the repository (topmost curve), and the subset of those which have been closed (as fixed or invalid). The difference between the two curves represents the number of issues still open at a given point in time - currently exactly 11,000, out of 53,648 issues total, so roughly 20%.\n\nThis is a fairly normal percentage of yet-unresolved issues in software projects of this scale, but it can definitely be better.\n\nI annotated the graph with some key events of Godot's development which match peaks in either reported bugs (usually at the start of a beta phase, or shortly after a stable release), or closed issues (when we do a \"spring cleaning\" going through old issues to check if they are still reproducible in a newly released Godot version). You can see notably two big peaks of closed issues around the 3.2 release, when we had a coordinated effort from maintainers to go through the whole backlog and ask reporters to confirm whether their issues were still valid, or had been fixed. This reduced the percentage of open issues from 29% to 19%, and it's been mostly stable since, with minor fluctuations.\n\nWe are preparing a new \"spring cleaning\" to properly reassess a lot of the old issues which have been opened before the 4.0 release, or in the early days of 4.0 or 4.1, and may no longer be relevant nowadays with 4.3 and soon 4.4 beta.\n\nAs the volume of issues keeps increasing steadily, but the number of active bug triagers doesn't really grow as fast, we are working on improving and documenting our workflows so that we can:\n\n- Onboard new volunteers to help triage new and old issues;\n- Spread the workload and be more consistent with our issue triage;\n- Be confident that while doing so, we do increase the _quality_ of our open issues, which isn't something that can be easily tracked in numbers.\n\nWe will share more details here and on the Godot blog when this process is ready to welcome new volunteers.\n\nIn the meantime, you can already do some simple things which help greatly the existing bug triage team:\n- [**Regularly re-assess your own issues**](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20author%3A%40me) (you can bookmark that URL). Make sure that they are reproducible in the latest stable release and dev snapshots, and that there is a minimal reproduction project that contributors can use to reproduce and fix the issue. If your issue is no longer relevant, please close it with a comment explaining why.\n- Feel free to apply the same process to other people's issues that you stumble upon, especially if their last update was a long time ago. In this case you can't close issues yourself, but you can suggest it by commenting that the issue is no longer reproducible in the version you tested. Bug triagers will get a notification and can double check.\n\n### Pull Requests\n\n![Graph showing pull request count over time](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf5027a6-4ad3-49bf-9834-d0e1cab2fdc9)\n*Visualization from OSS Insight showing pull request count over time, [see the interactive version](https://ossinsight.io/analyze/godotengine/godot#pr-history).*\n\nI didn't annotate this one, but a few takeaways:\n\n- Godot gets almost the same number of new pull requests per month than new issues, roughly 600 of each per month (that's 20 PRs and 20 issues per day).\n- The PR volume increased a lot over the lifetime of the project to culminate at over 700 PRs per month at the end of the 4.0 development. Since then, as the Godot userbase grew a lot and we are more careful with compatibility and API design, reviews can take a bit longer and the total monthly volume seems to have plateaued around 500-600. That's still plenty enough for a fairly small group of reviewers.\n- Someone should plot this data with relative percentages, but it seems like the size/complexity of pull requests is slightly increasing recently. Whether that trend gets confirmed or not, I can attest that reviewing 600 PRs per month is hard, and that we need more help for interested contributors and users to both test and review the PRs that get opened on a daily basis.\n\n---\n\nThat's all for now, I was already way too long and verbose while drafting this at the last minute to (try to) snatch the 100,000th issue number ;)\n\nAside from showing some cool numbers, I mostly want to convey that we are well aware that we have a significant backlog, though it's not as dire as it might look from the outside.\n\nTo deal with it, we need better triage and review processes (which we are designing now), more volunteers involved in these processes, but also importantly [**more funding**](https://fund.godotengine.org/). Volunteer contributors do a ton of work, but many critical parts of the workflow depend on a few paid contractors, and we need to grow that group to better manage the increasing scale of the project.\n\n[^1]: I'll make a quick note that 100,000 is the combined number of issues and PRs, which share the same index system on GitHub.\nAt the time of writing, we've actually had 53,648 issues and 45,213 PRs created. Astute minds will notice that the sum is not 100,000, the difference comes from spam issues or PRs which have been deleted by GitHub.\n",

I have only contributed a couple tiny bug fixes, but the fact I was able to contribute anything at all is because of this low barrier to entry. Also, I learned to program on Godot using GDScript for dumb hobby projects in college. I failed algebra and never thought I'd be a technical person, but I learned vector math through Godot's tutorials and had lots of fun, and 6-7 years later, last month, I got hired as a full time software engineer (not in gamedev). It's not a stretch to say that Godot has changed my life significantly for the better, and I hope to contribute more once I get settled into my new career and don't have to keep a side hustle or constantly job search anymore.

Both currently have sample data and are not functional yet.\n\n<img width=\"232\" height=\"92\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a51e5494-cad3-47f8-8333-1d50a811ff57\" />\n\n<img width=\"179\" height=\"92\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80d8a962-3d77-48fb-bfeb-a5d386a24d1b\" />\n\n(text shows when cursor hovers over button)\n\n**Original approach** (PR: #1975 ):\nFor adding the initial button in the main toolbar, I followed the following [article](https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseCommands/article.html) from vogella. The change of the button from the main toolbar to the toolbar of the editor (correct location) should be straightforward with a change of the `locationURI`. \n\n**Challenge I encountered**:\nI used the Plug-in Selection Spy to locate the identifier of the Plug-in Manifest Editor (`org.eclipse.pde.ui.manifestEditor`) and changed the `locationURI` to `toolbar: org.eclipse.pde.ui.manifestEditor`. However, when I tested it by opening the runtime workspace, I did not see the button in the toolbar of the editor. I tested different possible identifiers and looked through Eclipse documentation, but I still was not able to get the button to show through this approach.\n\n**Findings from different approach**: \nI chose to follow `Organizing Manifest Headers...` through the codebase since it already exists as a button on the editor toolbar, and I discovered the following: \n\n- `ManifestEditor.java`: contains function `contributeToToolbar()`, which adds actions to the toolbar of the editor and contains `getOrganizeManifestsAction()`, which retrieves and runs the action, and sets the tool tip text and icon for the button\n\n**In progress**:\n- translating what I originally did for the `Remove Unused Dependencies` button into a `RemoveUnusedDependenciesAction` class and then doing the same for a `PluginDependencyHierarchyAction` class\n\n**Question**:\nCurrently both buttons appear in the toolbar of the editor for the following tabs:\n\n<img width=\"447\" height=\"26\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f8134ec-3d0f-493c-895f-6aebce0c83fa\" />\n\nShould I make it so that these two buttons only appear in the toolbar for `Overview` and `Dependencies` ?", "See https://github.com/eclipse-pde/eclipse.pde/issues/2115 - This functionality does not work reliable, maybe not a good idea to promote it via additional functionality." ],
