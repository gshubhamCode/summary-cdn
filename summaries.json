As of now, Souvlaki leaves it up to the user to change the URL depending on the platform.\r\n\r\nFor Linux, we follow the MPRIS specification, which actually doesn't say much cover art apart from what's in [here](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/mpris-spec/metadata/#mpris:arturl). It only says that local files should start with `file://` and that it should be an UTF-8 string, which is enforced by Rust. Maybe you can look in the source code of desktop managers such as GNOME or KDE, since these read the field to display it on their media player controls.\r\n\r\nFor Windows, we use the _SystemMediaTransportControlsDisplayUpdater_, which has [a thumbnail property](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.media.systemmediatransportcontrolsdisplayupdater.thumbnail?view=winrt-22621#windows-media-systemmediatransportcontrolsdisplayupdater-thumbnail). It accepts multiple formats, but we choose to create it using an URI. If setting an URL starting with `file://`, the file is automatically loaded by souvlaki.\r\n\r\nFor MacOS, you can look into [these lines](https://github.com/Sinono3/souvlaki/blob/384539fe83e8bf5c966192ba28e9405e3253619b/src/platform/macos/mod.rs#L131-L137) of the implementation. These lines refer to creating an [MPMediaItemArtwork](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mediaplayer/mpmediaitemartwork) object.\r\n\r\nI hope this is of use to you.

Expected result\n\nFor certain libraries like MUI, we have imports purely for type augmentation like this:\n\n```ts\nimport type {} from '@mui/lab/themeAugmentation';\n```\n\nWe use `import type {}` so that it will only utilize the type information and nothing else during bundling.\n\nIn Biome v1 there was no error, but Biome v2 triggers an error for `lint/correctness/noUnusedImports` and the fixer actually removes the statement which causes other issues. \n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow Biome's Code of Conduct",

", "Hi team,\n\nI'd like to work on Issue #448 regarding the renaming of `owner_id` to `kinder_id` to align with KindFi's internal terminology and avoid confusion across the system.\n\nHere’s how I plan to approach it:\n\n### 1. Schema Refactor (Supabase)\n- Identify all instances of `owner_id` across the Supabase schema (tables, relationships, foreign keys).\n- Rename the columns to `kinder_id`, preserving existing constraints.\n- Create a properly versioned SQL migration file using Supabase CLI and place it under `services/supabase/migrations/`.\n- Validate database consistency after the rename through Supabase CLI and dashboard tools.\n\n### 2. Backend Adjustments (`services/supabase`)\n- Refactor all code references to `owner_id` across query logic, types, and service utilities.\n- Ensure all affected endpoints and mutations behave as expected with the updated schema.\n\n### 3. Frontend Integration (`apps/web`)\n- Update Supabase queries, types, and hooks that reference `owner_id`.\n- Refactor relevant components or forms handling project ownership or user metadata.\n- Run and update any impacted unit tests or mocks accordingly.\n\n### 4. Documentation\n- Update schema diagrams, ERD references, and technical documentation under `docs/` to reflect the updated field naming and align with project terminology.\n\n###  Deliverables\n- Fully working PR with schema + code changes.\n- A Supabase CLI-compatible SQL migration script.\n- Clear changelog and commit breakdown.\n- Optional: Schema diff or notes for internal dev reference.\n\n**ETA:** I estimate 36–48 hours for full implementation, testing, and documentation updates.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to take it! \nHappy to help standardize and improve the DB structure.\n", "# Hi there, @4c1d-V \uD83D\uDC4B You've been assigned this issue.\n\nOne invite is waiting for you in your email.

I disabled Windows search indexing on my Nextcloud directory because windows kept on downloading files I wanted to only keep online every time I searched for something in the parent folder.\n\nThe search function in the Nextcloud tray menu is able to find the desired sub folder, but clicking the folder only opens the containing folder and not the folder itself. This is useless to me because, as said, there are a lot of different folders and the folder names are too similar.\n\nIt looks like Nextcloud just opens the containing folder for folders or files. It would be nice if there was at least a context open to allow opening folder or files.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nOpen folder or file by default and have open containing folder the context menu option, but that risks messing with other people's workflow since open containing folder is the current behavior.",

It is clear that many contributors are not reading the contributing.MD or the documentation update readme. \n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nWe are a welcoming community and we would like to include all regardless of their learning methodology. Some read, others watch. So, we would like a video to welcome contributors and walk them through the basics of contributing to KubeStellar. Once completed, we can create a shortcut url and give it to anyone with a question about making a contribution. This saves everyone time.\n\n### Are you willing to contribute?\n\n- [ ] Yes, I'd like to help implement this feature.\n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_",

For Windows users, you need to install `sudo` to execute commands with elevated privileges. Here are the steps to install `sudo` on Windows:\n\n### Installing `sudo` on Windows\n\n1. **Using Chocolatey:**\n   - If you don't have Chocolatey installed, you can install it by following the instructions on the [Chocolatey website](https://chocolatey.org/install).\n   - Once Chocolatey is installed, open a command prompt as an administrator and run:\n     ```bash\n     choco install gsudo\n     ```\n\n2. **Using Scoop:**\n   - If you don't have Scoop installed, you can install it by following the instructions on the [Scoop website](https://scoop.sh/).\n   - Once Scoop is installed, open a command prompt as an administrator and run:\n     ```bash\n     scoop install gsudo\n     ```\n\n3. **Using WinGet:**\n   - If you don't have WinGet installed, you can install it by following the instructions on the [WinGet website](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli).\n   - Once WinGet is installed, open a command prompt as an administrator and run:\n     ```bash\n     winget install gerardog.gsudo\n     ```\n\n## Installation Instructions for KubeFlex\n\n1. **Download the KubeFlex CLI:**\n   - Download the latest KubeFlex CLI binary release for your OS/Architecture from the [release page](https://github.com/kubestellar/kubeflex/releases) and copy it to `/usr/local/bin` or another location in your `$PATH`.\n\n   For example, on Linux amd64:\n   ```bash\n   OS_ARCH=linux_amd64\n   LATEST_RELEASE_URL=\\$(curl -H \"Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json\" https://api.github.com/repos/kubestellar/kubeflex/releases/latest | jq -r '.assets[] | select(.name | contains(\"linux_amd64\")) | .browser_download_url')\n   sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 <(curl -L \\$LATEST_RELEASE_URL) /usr/local/bin/kfle\n\n\n2.**Alternative Installation Command:**\nYou can also use the following command, which will automatically detect the host OS type and architecture:\n\n```\nsudo bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubestellar/kubeflex/main/scripts/install-kubeflex.sh) --ensure-folder /usr/local/bin\n\n```\n", "@Krishna-mishra-26 ty for your help here. This document would probably work best as a PR in the KubeFlex documentation. @pdettori where would you like this to be placed in source?

      "description" : "# Issue\r\n\r\nTSLint is (unfortunately) no longer maintained and framework linting should be migrated to ESLint.\r\n\r\nThis was done four years ago in [this PR](https://github.com/FoalTS/foal/pull/561) for projects generated with Foal. This means that, when executing the `createapp` command, new projects generated with this command use ESLint.\r\n\r\nBut the framework monorepo itself has not yet been migrated to ESLint. This is a technical debt that should be resolved.\r\n\r\n# Guidelines\r\n\r\n- ~If [this PR](https://github.com/FoalTS/foal/pull/1260), which updates the way dependencies are managed in monorepo, has not yet been merged, the new branch should be created from `v4-5-0`. Otherwise, it should be created from `master`. Not only will this facilitate the migration to ESLint, it will also avoid the need for additional work later on to manage ESLint dependencies with the new dependency system.~\r\n- Migration to ESLint should not change the style of the framework code (we don't want thousands of line changes to commit). A lot of work had been done at the time in [this PR](https://github.com/FoalTS/foal/pull/561) to make ESLint rules consistent with TSLint rules. There's probably a lot to be learned from this PR.\r\n- When opening the framework repository with VSCode with the ESLint plugin enabled, VSCode should correctly highlight ESLint errors and correct them when saving (if the plugin is configurer to do so).\r\n\r\n# Notes\r\n\r\n- There *might* be useful information [here](https://typescript-eslint.io/getting-started/typed-linting/monorepos/).\r\n- The files `packages/cli/src/generate/specs/app/.eslintrc.js` and `packages/cli/src/generate/templates/app/.eslintrc.js` used by `foal createapp` to generate new projects may cause problems.",

I'll let you choose what you think is the best solution.\n\nThe ideal solution where we want to go is this:\n- the method used in the monorepo framework should be the same as that used in new projects generated by `foal createapp`,\n- and the linting rules used in the monorepo framework should be the same as those used in new projects generated by `foal createapp`.\n\nIn this way, when we write documentation and copy-paste code from the framework, the examples are always correctly “linted” when users then copy-paste the same code into their projects.\n\n**Note 1:** if we have this ideal solution with the same rules and the `createapp` rules are still the same and there are linting errors that appear from the framework code, then we can fix them all. Go for it \uD83D\uDC4D \n\n**Note 2:** in tests of the directory `acceptance-tests/`, there are pieces of code that are between comments such as `======== DOCUMENTATION BEGIN =======` and `====== DOCUMENTATION END =======`. In this case, this means that these codes are present in the documentation and should be updated as well in the markdowns in case of modification. You can ignore files in `docs/versioned_docs/` and `docs/i18n/`.\n\nThank you so much, for taking care of this.

      "description" : "1.8+ has a Chinese localization. We may have others contributed in the future. It would be useful to provide some type of automation around identifying:\n\n1. what en.yml strings do not have a corresponding localization for zh-CN.yml (what keys in en.yml do not exist in zh-CN.yml)\n1. what keys in zh-CN.yml do not exist in en.yml - these would be old keys in zh-CN.yml that may need removed, or they are misspelled keys\n1. if an en.yml string gets updated/modified, to flag which strings in zh-CN.yml need updated (this requires a clever git blame to determine the line number in the YAML file where a key starts and ensure the commit date of zh-CN.yml for a given key is greater than the commit date for the same key in en.yml. if en.yml is later that indicates that for this key the translation has been updated or modified and may need to be updated or modified for zh-CN. NOTE: a problem with this is if there is a false positive... like we fix a typo in the English or word it better but the Chinese is good and needs no update.. we could figure that out later). Could use https://www.rubydoc.info/github/libgit2/rugged/Rugged/Blame for this\n1. what strings in the application have not be internationalized (these strings are hardcoded)\n\nThere are many tools and approaches for this, but we want to keep deployment simple. The yaml files mean the translations stay with the code which is nice. Could probably use `for_line`. This also might encourage us to avoid multi-line strings in the locale files.\n\nMaybe a rake task is sufficient to start.\n\nAlso worth searching for existing tools that might assist with this as an alternative to writing our own.\n\n┆Issue is synchronized with this [Asana task](https://app.asana.com/0/1202821104799596/1204178484951391) by [Unito](https://www.unito.io)\n",

There are also tools like https://github.com/pejuko/i18n-translators-tools to convert the default Rails yaml into other formats for easier translation. We could also consider future versions of OnDemand using gettext. gettext doesn't use keys like the Rails yaml does, and just takes the full sentence and provides a translation for it. Most TMS support this out of the box, though there may also be examples of TMS projects that work with the Rails yaml formats. Another benefit of the gettext PO format is that its language/framework independent so if at some point we drop Rails or still have a mixture of Rails and other language/framework for apps in OnDemand, or want to translate error strings in Apache and/or NGINX as well, we can handle all of that in an language independent way.\r\n\r\nExamples: http://pootle.translatehouse.org/, http://zanata.org/ (RedHat product with free open source project support)\r\n\r\nSearch for \"open source translation management systems\" to see many options.", "Still thinking about this.

Feel free to develop on what would you expect from the cli and implementation details \n\nAs a workaround, you can create a shell alias to avoid typing the model name each time.

Now you can use `kai` followed by your prompt. For example:\n\n```sh\nkai \"I want to check the logs of logs.log and find \\n\"\n```\n\nThis will run the command with your input as the argument.\n\nYou can also come up with your own aliases based on your preferences and use cases", "In addition to what @zvdy suggested above, `kubectl-ai` also supports loading the configuration from a well defined path `~/.config/kubectl-ai/config.yaml`\n\nSo, you can do the following:\n\n```sh\n\nmkdir ~/.config/kubectl-ai/\ncat <<EOF > ~/.config/kubectl-ai/config.yaml\nmodel: gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17\nEOF\n\n```\n\nAfter this, you can confirm, the model using:\n\n```sh\nkubectl-ai --quiet model\n```\n\nEverything listed in [this struct](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubectl-ai/blob/main/cmd/main.go#L80) can be configured through this YAML file.\n\nAs you can see, documentation is lacking, feel free to make a PR for updating the README.md, I will be happy to review and get that in.\n\nLet me know if helps.\n\n/cc @noahlwest ", "Thanks a lot @zvdy, I was using an alias like the one you provided already, but I was looking for a better way, something like `kubectl-ai config`.\n\nThanks @droot, I'll work on the issue and keep you updated.", "I like the config approach, a profile like env file or something similar\n\nReminds me of a different feature for context resumption, so I can resume context for LLMs in sessions, so you don't have to explain again what it did and the steps performed yesterday or any other day and makes managing multiple clusters more easy\n\nFeel free to give it a try/PR and own it, I will also peek into that if I manage to get the time", "I updated the documentation in the [PR](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubectl-ai/pull/355).

      "repositoryName" : "onnx/onnx",
      "description" : "### System information\n\nTop of tree.\n\n### What is the problem that this feature solves?\n\nCurrently, ONNX’s `shape_inference.infer_shapes` API performs both type and shape inference simultaneously. Type inference is guaranteed in a valid model, but shape inference is on \"best effort\" basis. For some operators (e.g., GridSample, Gather, Reshape, Where, etc), shape inference may fail due to incomplete or complex shape logic, even when type inference could succeed. \nThis tight coupling prevents users from recovering type information when shape inference is unsupported or fails. For example, when users attempt to inject cast nodes or quantize nodes and propagate the type information downstream.\n\n\n**Request:**\nPlease consider adding an option to ONNX’s shape inference API to:\n- Run type inference independently of shape inference, so that type information can be propagated even when shape inference fails or is not implemented for an operator.\n- Alternatively, relax the requirement that shape inference must succeed for type inference to run.\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Enables users and downstream tools to recover and validate type information in more models, improving robustness and usability.\n- Reduces manual workarounds (such as manually setting types for affected nodes).\n- Makes ONNX models more portable and easier to analyze, even when shape logic is incomplete.\n\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n1. Create a separate function to support only type inference `infer_types` (preferable) \n2. Add boolean argument `check_shape=True` to the existing `infer_shapes` API (renaming the function is advisable in this case, `infer_shapes_and_types` or similar).\n\n\n### Describe the feature\n\nDecouple type inference from shape inference.\n\n\n### Will this influence the current api (Y/N)?\n\nDepends on the alternative selected. \nCan maintain backwards compatiblity.\n\n### Feature Area\n\nshape_inference\n\n### Are you willing to contribute it (Y/N)\n\nNone\n\n### Notes\n\nRelated issues https://github.com/onnx/onnx/issues/4934",

      "repositoryName" : "aquasecurity/trivy",
      "description" : "## Description\n\nThis is a feature request to add SHA-512 hash algorithm support to Trivy's SBOM parsing capabilities. Currently, Trivy only supports SHA-1, SHA-256, and MD5 hash algorithms when processing SBOM files.\n\nSome tools, particularly NPM's SBOM generation (`npm sbom`), use SHA-512 hashes for package integrity verification. Adding SHA-512 support would enable Trivy to fully process these SBOMs and preserve important security metadata.\n\n### Current limitations:\n- **CycloneDX**: SHA-512 hashes are ignored and the hashes field becomes `null`\n- **SPDX**: SHA-512 checksums are completely omitted from the output\n\n\n## Current Behavior\n\n### CycloneDX\nIn `pkg/sbom/cyclonedx/unmarshal.go:251-268`, the `unmarshalHashes` function only supports:\n- SHA1\n- SHA256\n- MD5\n\nAny other algorithm (including SHA-512) logs a warning but still creates a digest with an empty algorithm prefix (e.g., `:hashvalue` instead of `sha512:hashvalue`), resulting in malformed digest strings.\n\n### SPDX\nIn `pkg/sbom/spdx/marshal.go:501-522`, the `spdxChecksums` function has the same limitation, returning `nil` for unsupported algorithms.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe limitation stems from `pkg/digest/digest.go` which only defines three algorithms:\n```go\nconst (\n    SHA1   Algorithm = \"sha1\"\n    SHA256 Algorithm = \"sha256\"\n    MD5    Algorithm = \"md5\"\n)\n```\n\n## Desired Behavior\n\nTrivy should support SHA-512 hash algorithm alongside the existing SHA-1, SHA-256, and MD5 support. This would enable Trivy to:\n- Preserve SHA-512 hashes when processing SBOMs from NPM and other tools\n- Generate SBOMs with SHA-512 hashes when appropriate\n- Maintain full compatibility with CycloneDX and SPDX specifications\n\n\n## Impact\n\n- Loss of package integrity verification data\n- Generated SBOMs may be invalid or incomplete\n- Affects tools that rely on SHA-512 for security validation\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n1. Add SHA512 constant to `pkg/digest/digest.go`:\n   ```go\n   const (\n       SHA1   Algorithm = \"sha1\"\n       SHA256 Algorithm = \"sha256\"\n       SHA512 Algorithm = \"sha512\"\n       MD5    Algorithm = \"md5\"\n   )\n   ```\n\n2. Add SHA-512 calculation support in the digest package\n\n3. Update `unmarshalHashes` in CycloneDX:\n   ```go\n   case cdx.HashAlgoSHA512:\n       alg = digest.SHA512\n   ```\n\n4. Update `spdxChecksums` in SPDX:\n   ```go\n   case digest.SHA512:\n       alg = spdx.SHA512\n   ```\n\n## References\n\n- NPM SBOM documentation: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npm-sbom\n- CycloneDX hash algorithm specification: https://cyclonedx.org/docs/1.6/json/#components_items_hashes\n- SPDX checksum specification: https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/package-information/#79-package-checksum-field\n\n## Test Data\n\n### CycloneDX Example\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"http://cyclonedx.org/schema/bom-1.5.schema.json\",\n  \"bomFormat\": \"CycloneDX\",\n  \"specVersion\": \"1.5\",\n  \"components\": [\n    {\n      \"bom-ref\": \"lodash@4.17.21\",\n      \"type\": \"library\",\n      \"name\": \"lodash\",\n      \"version\": \"4.17.21\",\n      \"hashes\": [\n        {\n          \"alg\": \"SHA-512\",\n          \"content\": \"bf690311ee7b95e713ba568322e3533f2dd1cb880b189e99d4edef13592b81764daec43e2c54c61d5c558dc5cfb35ecb85b65519e74026ff17675b6f8f916f4a\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### SPDX Example\n```json\n{\n  \"spdxVersion\": \"SPDX-2.3\",\n  \"packages\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"lodash\",\n      \"SPDXID\": \"SPDXRef-Package-lodash-4.17.21\",\n      \"checksums\": [\n        {\n          \"algorithm\": \"SHA512\",\n          \"checksumValue\": \"bf690311ee7b95e713ba568322e3533f2dd1cb880b189e99d4edef13592b81764daec43e2c54c61d5c558dc5cfb35ecb85b65519e74026ff17675b6f8f916f4a\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Discussed in https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy/discussions/9082\n",

Add a standalone text link inside a link item\n2. See the broken alignment of the three-dot menu button\n3. Opne three-dot menu and select 'preview'\n4. See broken list\n\n**Expected behavior**\nEither disable the menu to switch between text and preview link inside lists, or fix both showing previews in lists and alignment of the button in lists.\n\n**Server details:**\n- Nextcloud version: 29\n",

Instead of only considering bindings for attribute assignments, we need to consider both bindings and declarations. Declarations are already correctly recorded in the semantic index, but in type inference, we currently only access the bindings. The patch below may be useful as a reference to see which places in the source code need to change. It switches everything from bindings-only to declarations-only (which would fix the issue here), but of course that needs to be extended to consider both.\n\nJust like when resolving references to normal variables, declarations should take precedence over bindings. That is, even if we see conflicting definitions such as `self.x: int` and `self.x = \"a string\"`, the type of the `x` attribute should just be `int`.\n\n<details>\n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/semantic_index.rs b/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/semantic_index.rs\nindex d4f848e69d..9be2b157d7 100644\n--- a/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/semantic_index.rs\n+++ b/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/semantic_index.rs\n@@ -108,7 +108,7 @@ pub(crate) fn attribute_assignments<'db, 's>(\n     db: &'db dyn Db,\n     class_body_scope: ScopeId<'db>,\n     name: &'s str,\n-) -> impl Iterator<Item = (BindingWithConstraintsIterator<'db, 'db>, FileScopeId)> + use<'s, 'db> {\n+) -> impl Iterator<Item = (DeclarationsIterator<'db, 'db>, FileScopeId)> + use<'s, 'db> {\n     let file = class_body_scope.file(db);\n     let index = semantic_index(db, file);\n \n@@ -116,7 +116,7 @@ pub(crate) fn attribute_assignments<'db, 's>(\n         let place_table = index.place_table(function_scope_id);\n         let place = place_table.place_id_by_instance_attribute_name(name)?;\n         let use_def = &index.use_def_maps[function_scope_id];\n-        Some((use_def.public_bindings(place), function_scope_id))\n+        Some((use_def.public_declarations(place), function_scope_id))\n     })\n }\n \ndiff --git a/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/semantic_index/use_def.rs b/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/semantic_index/use_def.rs\nindex 8ac7f91811..978ce2de7a 100644\n--- a/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/semantic_index/use_def.rs\n+++ b/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/semantic_index/use_def.rs\n@@ -463,10 +463,10 @@ impl<'db> UseDefMap<'db> {\n             .is_always_false()\n     }\n \n-    pub(crate) fn is_binding_reachable(\n+    pub(crate) fn is_declaration_reachable(\n         &self,\n         db: &dyn crate::Db,\n-        binding: &BindingWithConstraints<'_, 'db>,\n+        binding: &DeclarationWithConstraint<'db>,\n     ) -> Truthiness {\n         self.reachability_constraints.evaluate(\n             db,\ndiff --git a/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/types/class.rs b/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/types/class.rs\nindex 3cd7bffa5b..371291a94a 100644\n--- a/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/types/class.rs\n+++ b/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/types/class.rs\n@@ -1744,10 +1744,10 @@ impl<'db> ClassLiteral<'db> {\n                     let method = index.expect_single_definition(method_def);\n                     let method_place = class_table.place_id_by_name(&method_def.name).unwrap();\n                     class_map\n-                        .public_bindings(method_place)\n-                        .find_map(|bind| {\n-                            (bind.binding.is_defined_and(|def| def == method))\n-                                .then(|| class_map.is_binding_reachable(db, &bind))\n+                        .public_declarations(method_place)\n+                        .find_map(|decl| {\n+                            (decl.declaration.is_defined_and(|def| def == method))\n+                                .then(|| class_map.is_declaration_reachable(db, &decl))\n                         })\n                         .unwrap_or(Truthiness::AlwaysFalse)\n                 } else {\n@@ -1762,7 +1762,7 @@ impl<'db> ClassLiteral<'db> {\n             let mut unbound_binding = None;\n \n             for attribute_assignment in attribute_assignments {\n-                if let DefinitionState::Undefined = attribute_assignment.binding {\n+                if let DefinitionState::Undefined = attribute_assignment.declaration {\n                     // Store the implicit unbound binding here so that we can delay the\n                     // computation of `unbound_reachability` to the point when we actually\n                     // need it.

      "description" : "Part of #12048\n\n## Issue\nAfter most of the Unit Test migration in #12048, there are a lot of inconsistencies in access control test methods. This is because we did not migrate the many convenient, abstracted, and commonly used access control test methods from `ui/webapi/BaseActionTest.java` to `sqlui/webapi/BaseActionTest.java`.\n\nAfter merging #13254, all of the access control test methods in `BaseActionTest.java` have been migrated. Hence, this issue aims to refactor the unit test access controls to use these convenient test methods.\n\n## Progress\nThe progress for this refactoring can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IcB-viJMrIOknYoBYasBuRBK9qnwY0-doEK4_Eb24IA/edit?gid=0#gid=0). I (the author) will update it when completed PRs are merged proactively.\n\n## Steps to Contribute\n\n1. Choose test(s) to work on in the above Google Sheets link\n2. Check that no on else have claimed the test cases to work on within the last 2 weeks, or that it has been completed by follow up PRs (but not updated in the sheets)\n3. Comment on this issue to indicate that you'd like to contribute on the chosen test(s). Update your comment if you need more than 2 weeks so that other contributors don't overlap with your work.\n4. Create a PR to refactor the unit test(s).\n5. Submit the PR, with a link to this issue by starting the description with \"Part of #13304\"## Tips\n\n- Understand the access control test methods in `sqlui/webapi/BaseActionTest.java`, follow the refactoring in #13254\n- Most of the access control testing logic in the migrated unit tests under `sqlui/webapi` follows the old unit tests under `ui/webapi`, so you may wish to reference the old unit test for help",

This is similar to #10281 but specific to the appearance.\n\nFor example, when saving settings [we include an ellipsis](https://github.com/google/site-kit-wp/blob/8f1c16bb71bcf5091bc5b56d535e03973d4b9b36/assets/js/components/settings/SettingsActiveModule/Footer.js#L153-L155), but in nearly all other similar buttons we do not.\n\n---------------\n\n_Do not alter or remove anything below. The following sections will be managed by moderators only._\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n\n* When module settings are being saved, after CTA has been clicked and CTA enters in progress state, only spinner icon should be showing, text shouldn't be changing to the `Saving` and ellipsis should not show `...`\n\n## Implementation Brief\n\n* [ ] Update `assets/js/components/settings/SettingsActiveModule/FooterPrimaryAction.js`\n  * Remove https://github.com/google/site-kit-wp/blob/4946f1a5df79dfac2ac8f94c6a03283a163241a1/assets/js/components/settings/SettingsActiveModule/FooterPrimaryAction.js#L75 and conditional wrapper around it.\n  * Spinner is already integrated, so no further change is needed\n\n### Test Coverage\n\n* No updates expected\n\n## QA Brief\n\n* <!-- One or more bullet points for how to test that the feature works as expected. -->\n\n## Changelog entry\n\n* <!-- One sentence summarizing the PR, to be used in the changelog. -->\n",

      "description" : "### Steps to reproduce\n\nUse the code below or try dartpad:\n[https://dartpad.dev/?id=06c010125e651e2bfadeecbff2db181a](https://dartpad.dev/?id=06c010125e651e2bfadeecbff2db181a)\nI tested it on the main branch and on the stable one.\n\n### Expected results\n\n`PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber` should return actual frame number on the Web, just like on other platforms.\n\n### Actual results\n\nOn the web `PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber` returns always -1.\nI have tested the code below on the desktop (Windows) and it returns the correct ascending frame numbers. But on the web (via `flutter run -d chrome` or dartpad) this method always returns -1.\nI also found two strange behaviors (potential bugs?).\n1. `frameNumber` has the old value until the end of the transientCallbacks phase. If this is not a bug, it should be documented. The picture below shows a different number in different callbacks during a frame. (underlined in blue)\n2.  `scheduleMicrotask` method calls its callback after the frame ends on the web, and not between `onBeginFrame` and `onDrawFrame` as expected (underlined in red). On the desktop (Windows) it works correctly.\n\n### Code sample\n\n<details open><summary>Code sample</summary>\n\n```dart\nimport 'dart:async';\nimport 'dart:ui';\n\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:flutter/scheduler.dart' show SchedulerBinding, Ticker;\n\nvoid main() {\n  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();\n\n  // ignore: invalid_use_of_protected_member\n  SchedulerBinding.instance.ensureFrameCallbacksRegistered();\n\n  final onBeginFrame = PlatformDispatcher.instance.onBeginFrame;\n  final onDrawFrame = PlatformDispatcher.instance.onDrawFrame;\n\n  PlatformDispatcher.instance.onBeginFrame = (Duration elapsed) {\n    print('+' * 30);\n    final frameNumber = PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber;\n    print('frameNumber from onBeginFrame callback: $frameNumber');\n    onBeginFrame!(elapsed);\n    print('___finish onBeginFrame');\n  };\n\n  PlatformDispatcher.instance.onDrawFrame = () {\n    print('___start onDrawFrame');\n    onDrawFrame!();\n    final frameNumber = PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber;\n    print('frameNumber from onDrawFrame callback: $frameNumber');\n    print('-' * 30);\n  };\n\n  runApp(const App());\n}\n\nclass App extends StatelessWidget {\n  const App({super.key});\n\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return const MaterialApp(debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false, home: Home());\n  }\n}\n\nclass Home extends StatefulWidget {\n  const Home({super.key});\n\n  @override\n  State<Home> createState() => _HomeState();\n}\n\nclass _HomeState extends State<Home> with TickerProviderStateMixin {\n  Ticker? ticker;\n\n  @override\n  void initState() {\n    super.initState();\n\n    SchedulerBinding.instance.addPersistentFrameCallback((_) {\n      final frameNumber = PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber;\n      print('frameNumber from the persistent callback: $frameNumber');\n    });\n\n    ticker = createTicker((_) {\n      final frameNumber = PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber;\n      print('frameNumber from the transient callback: $frameNumber');\n      scheduleMicrotask(() {\n        final frameNumber = PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber;\n        print('frameNumber from the microtask callback: $frameNumber');\n      });\n      SchedulerBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback((_) {\n        final frameNumber = PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber;\n        print('frameNumber from the postframe callback: $frameNumber');\n      });\n    })..start();\n\n    Timer(const Duration(seconds: 1), () {\n      ticker?.dispose();\n      ticker = null;\n    });\n  }\n\n  @override\n  void dispose() {\n    ticker?.dispose();\n    super.dispose();\n  }\n\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return const Placeholder();\n  }\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Screenshots or Video\n\n<details open>\n<summary>Screenshots / Video demonstration</summary>\n\nOn the desktop:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abca8f1d-4d88-4d5a-988e-974c58d0052e)\n\nOn the web:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fcfb6c2-ea1e-4c92-b62f-d7a800e01791)\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Logs\n\n\n\n\n### Flutter Doctor output\n\n<details open><summary>Doctor output</summary>\n\n```console\n[√] Flutter (Channel main, 3.33.0-1.0.pre.619, on Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.19045.5965], locale ru-RU)\n[√] Windows Version (Њ ©Єа®б®дв Windows 10 Pro 64-а §ап¤­ п, 22H2, 2009)\n[√] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 34.0.0)\n[√] Chrome - develop for the web\n[√] Visual Studio - develop Windows apps (Visual Studio Build Tools 2022 17.6.5)\n[√] Android Studio (version 2022.2)\n[√] VS Code (version 1.101.1)\n[√] Connected device (4 available)\n[√] Network resources\n\n• No issues found!\n```\n\n</details>\n",

A rough list of easy plots/recipes:\n- [ ] arc\n- [ ] band\n- [ ] pie\n- [ ] poly\n- [ ] stairs\n- [ ] stem\n- [ ] tooltip\n- [ ] wireframe\n- [ ] density\n- [ ] qqplot (distributions.jl)\n- [ ] stephist\n- [ ] hist\n- [ ] timeseries\n- [ ] series\n\nSome recipes still use `register_computation!()` when they could use `map!()`. This should be a fairly easy cleanup/replacement as well.\n- [ ] tricontourf\n- [ ] spy\n- [ ] scatterlines\n\nSome recipes may require some more refactoring, like breaking up an `onany` that updates multiple observables. They should still be fairly easy to translate (though I haven't checked in depth). `contourf` or `errorbars` might be an instructive example.\n- [ ] arrows\n- [ ] barplot\n- [ ] contour\n- [ ] triplot\n- [ ] waterfall\n- [ ] boxplot\n- [ ] crossbar\n- [ ] hexbin\n- [ ] violin\n\nSome recipes apply transformations and projections. These should probably be delayed a bit, as we can/should extend what's happening for primitive plots to recipe plots here\n- ~~hlines, vlines, hspan, vspan (+ limit tracking)~~\n- [ ] annotation (+ bbox handling)\n- [ ] bracket\n- [ ] streamplot (or maybe refactor rotation handling?)\n- [ ] textlabel\n- [ ] voronoiplot\n\nOther:\n- [ ] volumeslices (how do we want to handle the transformation system)\n\nNot sure if done:\n- [ ] axis3d (maybe needs full rework?)\n- [ ] datashader\n- [ ] rainclouds",

Models are currently packaged as CPU-only Docker images. The goal of this project is to evaluate and implement GPU support using Docker.\n\n## Goals\n\n- Demonstrate that a model can run inside a Docker container with GPU access.\n- Build the foundation to support GPU in the Ersilia infrastructure (template, CLI, metadata, CI/CD).\n- Benchmark performance between CPU and GPU runs.\n\n## Step 1: Manual GPU Docker Test (Top-Down)\n\nWe will first verify that models can run in a GPU-enabled Docker container, without relying on Ersilia's internal infrastructure (e.g., CLI or model template).\n\n- [ ] Select two test models:\n  - [ ] One **GPU-only** model (TBD).\n  - [ ] One **GPU/CPU-compatible** model (suggested: FAISS-based).\n- [ ] Set up the new GPU workstation.\n- [ ] Choose and test an appropriate CUDA base image (e.g., `nvidia/cuda:...`).\n- [ ] Ensure image size is acceptable (<~4GB ideally).\n- [ ] Run tests on:\n  - [ ] At least two local GPU workstations.\n  - [ ] One cloud instance (e.g., AWS GPU instance).\n\n## Step 2: Integrate GPU Support into Ersilia Infrastructure\n\n### \uD83E\uDDF1 At the [Ersilia Template](https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos-template) level\n\n- [ ] How should `install.yml` indicate GPU requirements?\n- [ ] If model code differs between CPU/GPU, how should this be reflected in the `framework/`?\n\n### ⚙️ At the [Ersilia CLI](https://github.com/ersilia-os/ersilia) level\n\n- [ ] Add support for `--gpu` or `--cpu` flags in the `ersilia serve` command.\n- [ ] Decide whether GPU/CPU mode should be:\n  - Explicit (user-defined via flag), or\n  - Automatic (detect from hardware?)\n- [ ] Assess: Can one image support both CPU and GPU, or do we need separate ones?\n\n### \uD83D\uDCE6 At the [Ersilia Metadata](https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos5axz/blob/main/metadata.json) level\n\n- [ ] Add `runtime: GPU` / `CPU` or similar field.\n- [ ] Consider `requirements` or `compatibility` sections if needed.\n\n### \uD83D\uDC33 On [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/ersiliaos)\n\n- [ ] Should GPU-compatible images use a separate tag (e.g., `model:gpu`) or separate repo?\n- [ ] Define tagging convention early.\n\n## Step 3: GitHub Actions & CI Integration\n\nIn the [Ersilia Model Workflows](https://github.com/ersilia-os/ersilia-model-workflows):\n\n- [ ] Detect whether a model supports GPU.\n- [ ] Build and push a GPU-compatible Docker image (using `nvidia-docker`).\n- [ ] Ensure existing workflows are not broken.\n\nIn the [Ersilia CLI CI/CD](https://github.com/ersilia-os/ersilia):\n\n- [ ] Add at least one unit test to check GPU execution (on GitHub-hosted runners or self-hosted runner with GPU).\n\n## Step 4: Benchmarking & Validation\n\n- [ ] Run performance benchmarks:\n  - CPU vs GPU execution time.\n  - Memory consumption and constraints.\n- [ ] Record any limitations or environment-specific requirements.",

For example : \n\n```nvidia/cuda:12.9.0-runtime-ubuntu24.04```\n\nThis comes to ~ 2 GB/3 GB depending on the exact CUDA and Ubuntu Version being used. \n\nIdeally run automated tests/builds for different combinations of Ubuntu (or other distributions?) and CUDA  versions. \n\n## CPU vs GPU preliminary testing\n\nA very simple test on TabPFN using a [Sci-Kit Learn Breast Cancer Dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html) showed approximately 3x-4x speed ups when GPU access to the process was enabled, compared to CPU only runs (on the Norrsken GPU Workstation).\n\nMore detailed tests using a [Dataset of approximately 2 Million Compounds](https://github.com/ersilia-os/sars-cov-2-chemspace/blob/main/data/reference_library_inchikeys.csv) showed overwhelming speed-ups with GPU Accelerated similarity searches using [FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss), the difference between search times of GPU and CPU implementations scaled/diverged with the Index size. **It is clearly worth trying to accelerate models using GPU Acceleration.**\n\nWe built indices out of Count Fingerprints of the compounds (converted the SMILES to 2048 Vectors). Cosine Similarity was used as a metric. \n\nFAISS does not support cosine by default, so we use  an `Inner Product` index and perform L2 (Euclidean) Normalisation on the vectors before adding to them to the index (or before searching), which is the equivalent of using Cosine similarity.\n\nTests were ran with index sizes of `10,000`, `100,000`, `500,000` and `1,000,000`. Nearest 100 Neighbours. \n\n### Index size 100,000:\n| Number of Searches | CPU (s) | GPU (s) |\n|--------------------|---------|---------|\n| 100                | 1       | 0.01    |\n| 1,000              | 7.08    | 0.04    |\n| 10,000             | 67.49   | 0.11    |\n| 100,000            | >350    | 1.30    |\n| 500,000            | -       | 5.50    |\n\n### Index size 1,000,000\n\n| Number of Searches | CPU (s) | GPU (s) |\n|--------------------|---------|---------|\n| 100                | 9.42    | 0.02    |\n| 1,000              | 71      | 0.10    |\n| 10,000             | 711     | 1.03    |\n| 100,000            | -       | 10.45   |\n| 500,000            | -       | 52.50   |\n\n\n\n### \n\n<img width=\"765\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e39adae0-7c06-43ba-ba5f-3da89037da02\" />\n\n_NOTE: GPUs are typically higher latency but have higher parallel throughput and memory bandwidth than CPUs. It is best to use batch queries with the CPU or GPU as this amortises the touching of index memory across all of the queries and this is when GPU speed ups are convenient. We will most likely not see any improvements in GPU search times with single queries (if anything it might be slower because of GPU overhead)._\n\n\nThe examples of inference time comparisons and a 3D plot (inference time against index and query sizes), clearly demonstrate **GPUs provide absolutely non-trivial speed ups for the right tasks.**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "# Very Heavy Index (FAISS Flat)\n\nFlat (IP and L2 for example) indices are extremely large (because FAISS only supports Float32 vectors, hence each Fingerprint vector is 32 * 2048 = 65,536 Bits or 4 * 2048=8,192  Bytes), scaling up to millions of vectors means we are dealing with indices that are 10s of GBs.\n\nTried FPSim2 but there are no benefits to GPU accelerating since it does not support batch queries (could be worth looking into CUDA Programming and tuning it to support batch queries, as it supports Sparse Vectors and Tanimoto Search on GPU)\n\n## Promising alternative to Flat FAISS Index: **Approximate Nearest Neighbour (ANN) search**\n\nMost methods for ANN require index training and parameter tuning which makes building the index more complex. We also need to ensure that the training sample is diverse. \n\nPlease note the difference between training and adding to Indices. And index cannot be trained incrementally but can be incrementally added to.\n\nMemory bottlenecks are also an issue so I first train the index and then add vectors to it incrementally in batches. (Although, it is suggested, If possible at all,  add more compute at index build time. (Especially if the index does not change a lot over time))\n\nThe following ANN methods are explored and suggested (compared to ~16 GB with a flat index of around 1.99 million Vectors)\n\n### **_IVFPQ (Inverted File Index with Product Quantisation):_** \n\n#### **_I am yet to do Accuracy tests on IVFPQ but with computational performance (inference time), models seem to enjoy GPU Acceleration speed ups similar to those mentioned above for FAISS Flat indices._**\n\nThis creates very light indices: `~93 MB for an index of around 1.99 Million Vectors`, but there might be a non-trivial loss of accuracy. \n\nNote: For some reason after the index is trained and incrementally built, FAISS takes a lot of time to write it to disk which makes it look like the process is frozen but isn't actually frozen - it goes into an \"uninterruptible sleep\" because of Disk IO, as indicated by the \"D\" state in htop. \n\n### **_HNSWSQ (Hierarchical Navigable Small World Index with Scalar Quantisation)_**\n\nTraining is reasonably fast (with GPU) but adding vectors is computationally intensive and needs to batched appropriately.\n\n#### **_I am yet to do Accuracy tests on HNSWSQ but with computational performance , HNSW seem to enjoy GPU Acceleration only with at Training time as indices are pretty compact and are VERY FAST with CPU and FAISS does not have a GPU search for this yet._**\n\nWhen choosing the strength of quantisation, there is a trade off between memory and accuracy:\n\nIndex of **1.99 million Vectors**:\n\n```\n4.63 GB (~2KB Per Vector + overhead) with a  8-Bit Quantiser while maintaining around 95-98% Accuracy^\n\n\n\n2.59 GB (~1.15KB Per Vector + overhead) with a 4-Bit Quantiser  while maintaining around 90-95% Accuracy^\n```\n\n\nAdding vectors to this kind of index is slow.\n\n_^accuracy according to official documentation and third party tests_\n", "# Metric Learning - Embedding Model\n\nAnother alternative to using vanilla flat indices with 2048 dimensional fingerprints we explore is the use of a metric learning model to create embeddings that are lower dimensions. We use these embeddings to create flat FAISS indices that are much lighter than the standard fingerprint indices (512, 256, 128, 100 dimensional embeddings vs 2048 dimensional fingerprints). We uses torch's GPU version and enjoy non-trivial speed-ups at training time, while creating embeddings and inference time (FAISS Search using a GPU index).\n\nNote: The searches are performed on a flat index, hence are exact searches, but the using of the embedding model means there is an approximation.", "We are aiming to create compound similarity search models with 4 compound libraries:\n\n- ChemDiv (100k)\n- A representative of Enamine  (~9 million)\n- DrugBank (~11k)\n- COCONUT (should be between 500k and 1 Million)\n\nWe also create a _Metric Learning Embedding Model_ out of a [reference library of 2 million compounds.](https://github.com/ersilia-os/sars-cov-2-chemspace/blob/main/data/reference_library_inchikeys.csv).\n\nFor each of the above libraries the aim is to have 3 variants of indices:\n\n- _A flat IP index with L2 Normalisation_\n    - This is going to be very large for libraries with 500k+ compounds)\n\n- _A compressed IVFPQ IP index  with L2 normalisation (FAISS compression)_\n   - This creates very light indices but as mentioned above there is a loss of search accuracy\n\n- _A flat index created with embeddings from the above mentioned model._\n   - This is lets us create indices that are lighter than vanilla flat indices and also lets us have control and confidence over the accuracy of the search (given that we are confident in the embedding model, which is arguably simpler to benchmark).\n \n", "Implemented a metric learning pipeline that creates learned embeddings from existing flat FAISS index. \n\n### Transforms 2048-dimensional fingerprints → _256/128/100-dimensional learned embeddings_ with cosine similarity\n\n### Triplet sampling: Uses existing 2M compound FAISS index for mining hard positives/negatives\n\nEvaluations: ROC-AUC, AP, distance distributions, t-SNE visualizations\n\nThe pipeline maintains L2 normalization throughout for FlatIP cosine similarity and includes model checkpointing + SMILES mapping for deployment.\n\nCreated with PyTorch + FAISS GPU.

Please describe.**\nStarting in `v7.10.0`, all subviews have a thin border/outline around them to make it easily distinguishable from other elements on the form. We have received feedback from some users that this is not always desirable, for instance when you have a subview within a larger subview, or when the headings clearly separate portions of the form. Some have mentioned they simply prefer the look without them and understand the implications of not clearly segmenting each table. \n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nOne of two solutions would be acceptable, with the first one being **preferred**.\n\n1. Allow users to configure subview outlines in the XML, setting them to `true` or `false` via an attribute (e.g. `outline`). The default would be `true`.\n\n2.

      "url" : "https://github.com/ONEARMY/community-platform/issues/4245",
      "repositoryName" : "ONEARMY/community-platform",
      "description" : "> Do you have attention to detail and would like to work on making the UI nicer? This issue is then for you! :))\n\n## Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.\n1. Comment section is still not matching the designs. The whitespace is lacking between the nested comments and the visually it looks tight, packed and overwhelming.\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6340e9d-7671-4308-acd0-10bf42bffd4b)\n\n2. Additionally the comment on mobile has spacing from the left, leaving the space not being utilised and making the text unnecessarily squeezed.\n<img width=\"361\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28e206b7-fbe6-471c-a2c4-8f09b1284eeb\" />\n\nEspecially with nested comments it becomes obvious:\n<img width=\"361\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86610c32-e365-414c-868e-02621ca54564\" />\n\n3. If the comment has some enters for new line and the the Show more button shows, it creates an awkward space. There is also gap applied.\n<img width=\"918\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a76486ea-e490-4860-940e-c49498ebeb1e\" />\n\n## Describe the solution you'd like\n\nGenerally I think this will need not only adjusting the numbers, but some minor restructuring of the divs. So, let me try to number the improvements:\n\n---\n\n1. Improving the spacings between the nested comments. In the designs there are also the useful buttons in each comment, that are not yet implemented. In the design however, the spacing occurs naturally because of the useful buttons, so I did not need to add a big margin-bottom. I will leave the solution here up to you, but account for the fact that one day in the future we will introduce the useful button for the comment.\n<img width=\"670\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00f1a492-0cfe-4a26-a6d4-a25e9f1e81d2\" />\n\nDon't be afraid to be generous with the spacings, in the devtools i tried 50px as in my designs\n<img width=\"978\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f23db889-05ba-4607-bedc-25d4a4abc321\" />\n\n---\n\n2. Mobile improvement. Here I upload a gif of the solution that I utilised in the Figma designs - it was to hide the left column with the avatar, allowing the text to stretch and then showing the avatar next to the username in 30x30px size.\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/329f7267-8bdb-4d18-a47c-73b7e44d5478)\n\nDon't forget to make sure that the author's badge is working \n<img width=\"502\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b3012c1-567c-4e5e-b781-5f81852bbe28\" />\n\n\n---\n\n3. Putting the Show More button directly under the comment, trimming the whitespaces. \n<img width=\"947\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c07017f7-60f7-4c1c-92f4-859c1267736f\" />\n\n\n---\n\n4. Decreasing the gap here to 5px from 10px\n<img width=\"404\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a1c56f9-11f3-4bd0-9e52-239948b15c2f\" />\n\n\n\n---\n\n5. As you can see, on mobile it gets quite tight. I would suggest removing the word Published from the \"Published x time ago\" information for the comments.\n<img width=\"322\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe06174a-b402-452b-a18b-eefd38b03192\" />\n\n\n---\n\n6. OPTIONAL - In case you would want to act on the point 5. above even more, I would suggest for mobile screens shortening the formulation even more, saying for example 1h ago, 3mo ago or 2yr ago. Reddit does it this way as well.\n\n<img width=\"182\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c194f4c-a4ee-42a1-9c59-dcd5c6b77e42\" />\n\n---\n\n7. OPTIONAL - In case you would still be up for a challenge, having these 2 aligned on the baseline would be a nice achievement, however I didn't manage to get the desired result, since as you can see below, the align-items:baseline does not align them.\n<img width=\"742\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27968c77-de84-400a-8d3f-22e88b37b627\" />\n\n\n\n##  Additional context - [FIGMA FILE HERE](https://www.figma.com/design/XYV3fr8UVOdkNyBmKHHR7f/CP---Comments-Useful---Mobile?node-id=48-79)\nYou can find the figma file above. You can see the components, the desktop and the mobile versions. These design include the correct answer feature or the useful buttons, which are not yet implemented, so feel free to ignore those.\n\n<img width=\"761\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/119c7345-44cf-4baa-9ef6-feed6a05d7ad\" />\n\nIf you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask. :))",

Cool to see that you are up for tackling these design improvements. \n\nJust yesterday we were talking with Ben, that this issue was in his opinion hard to follow and that the screenshots I included could be a bit confusing (some of them with the useful button, some without), so I thought about rewriting it. Is the issue clear to you though? If so, than let's keep it and if you find anything even slightly unclear you can tag me in the comments at any time and I'll be happy to give more clarification. :))\n\nAlso Ben mentioned that he does not have the capacity to prioritise this at the moment, so this would actually be really really helpful and valuable contribution from you. <3\n\nBen was also wrote yesterday that some of the points I mentioned were implemented already. After checking, it was only the point 5. - removing the word \"Published\" from the timestamp.\n\nI will ask the team about implementing the useful counter and let you know. :))", "@dalibormrska  - I think I understand it, but here let me try to summarize and let me know if I am understanding your requests correctly.\n\n\nRequest 1: Increase spacing between the nested comments.\nSolutions:\n- Long Term Solution: Add the Useful Counter to comments which will naturally add whitespace between the comments\n- Easier Solution: Manually add whitespace between the nested comments (which is the space the Useful Counter will take up later)\n\nRequest 2: When viewing comments (especially reply comments) in mobile, the comment text is extremely narrow.\nSolution: Remove the left side margin (make the comment text and profile image be on the same vertical line). Use the smaller version of the profile picture. Basically try to get to this design:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4045704-088e-4a7c-a7ff-bf3d1c5535b3)\n\nRequest 3: If a comment has alot of line breaks, there could be an awkward gap between the comment text and the 'Show more' button\nSolution: Remove line breaks from the end of the comment when hiding the rest of the comment behind the 'Show more' button\n\nRequest 4: Decrease Gap between profile/upload date line and comment body from 10px to 5px\nSolution: This is straight forward :), just decrease gap from 10px to 5px\n\nRequest 5: Remove the 'Published ... time ago' part of the upload date to save space\nSolution: Already Done :)\n\nRequest 6 (OPTIONAL): The upload date still takes alot of space on mobile\nSolution: Use time short hand in mobile. For example, use '5h ago' instead of '5 hours ago' or '4mo ago' instead of '4 months ago'\n\nRequest 7 (OPTIONAL): The user flag, user name, and upload date are not aligned\nSolution: Align the 3 on the baseline", "Cool, well summarised, it's pretty much spot-on. :)) \n\nThe only thing that got trickier since then is the Request 4. If you run the project locally or are a beta-tester, you will see that now the three-dots menu next to the top-comment has been implemented. The three-dots button is huge however, which makes the whole header of the top-comment taller than the replies and therefore makes it hard to achieve consistent gap.\n\nI don't know however what makes the most sense from the coding best practices - but I imagine if you tackle the Request 2. and include the avatar image in the comment header, then the whole header will get the height of the image. I would then suggest trying to make the image size and the three-dots menu size the same - let's try 35x35px and adjusting the gap accordingly.\n\n<img width=\"747\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be0d2dc1-70f8-41db-b36a-7eda73e85eb2\" />\n\nOther than that we just wait for @benfurber to assign. :))", "I'm sceptical of making the avatar too small, otherwise what's the point of showing it.\n\nIt's yours @JCSergent.\n\nOne thing to note, I'm about to implement some icon changes which includes the pointing down arrow in these screenshots." ],

The other columns sort in the expected order based on the sort type.\n\nAs part of this we should take stock of other sortable demos/examples to ensure they're sorting correctly as expected (ignoring columns that don't utilize text, i.e. a \"favorites\" column that only has a star icon button; this will be handled by https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/issues/11006)\n\n**Is this request originating from a Red Hat product team?

It’s a hard process and the codebase for that project is huge.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that MacOS techniques aren’t our speciality. Although we support it, we don’t really maintain it as Linux and Windows are the most demanded platforms for this sort of project.", "@kernelwernel Thanks for the response, \n\n\nBut I think I have found the solution for that, I have added one more check for detection of Hypervisor in MAC and it helped me.\n\n`sysctl kern.hv_vmm_present` \n\nit helped me to detect UTM.", "@AdnanAhad That’s incredibly useful to know, thanks!

While I don't have a fix yet, we've previously encountered a very similar issue before (https://github.com/kernelwernel/VMAware/issues/359) and all we've done to fix it was by detecting binary translation environments and blacklisting (if found) for those specific techniques, and I'm pretty sure this is the path we'll take but I need to consult with my co-dev (@NotRequiem) who manages these techniques. I assume he's sleeping at the moment, but I'll let him know about the issue.\n\n> You can see in that all hypervisor registers are all zeroes.\n\nThat technique isn't really relevant in this scenario, it's relatively common to have that output.\n\n> I know that a normal hypervisor will return a bendstring when calling CPUID EAX=0x40000000. However, it is a bit strange to see that it is detected as a VM even though it is all 0.\n\nI assume you meant \"brand string\" instead of bendstring, but this is also not surprising since it's a binary translator. I *assume* you have Microsoft PRISM doing the x86 to ARM translation, which isn't really accurate to call it an emulator in itself but that's besides the point.\n\nA lot of funky stuff happens when the binary is being translated to a different ISA, but we still do our best to keep it as compatible as possible with the same core mechanisms we've done for real x86 hardware. We'll let you when there's a fix available.\n\n\n", "I see now that the issue was more complex than I initially thought. It seems I was looking in the wrong direction.

The contributor was asked to run a debug binary and share the output, which revealed that all hypervisor registers were zero. The contributor was also asked to run another binary and share the results, which showed no detection of a VM. The issue was finally fixed by whitelisting the TPM manufacturer and updating the firmware check. The contributor was asked to create an issue on GitHub if they found a false positive. The issue was labeled as a 'bug' and a 'good first issue'. The contributor was also asked to run another test binary to confirm the fix. The repository is a VM detection library and tool, and the issue was reported on the GitHub issues page. The contributor was asked to create an issue if they found a false positive, and the issue was labeled as a 'bug' and a 'good first issue'.",

A simple x seconds delay configurable from the yaml file would allow users to slow down crawls.\r\n\r\nThis is similar to https://github.com/elastic/crawler/issues/46 (abiding by `Crawl-delay` in robots.txt). However, a general delay would be useful for users who can't or don't want to change the robots.txt.\r\n\r\nWhen both are implemented, the highest value of the two should be used for the crawl delay.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Solution\r\n\r\nAdd a configurable crawl delay in yaml file.\r\n\r\n### Additional Context\r\n\r\nLink to discuss forum: https://discuss.elastic.co/t/apply-delay-between-requests-in-elastic-crawler/361375/4\r\n",

Write a brief description of how you will approach the task (without using ChatGPT).\n3. Add your Telegram handler in your application (e.g., in OnlyDust or similar)\n4. Write ETA in your application\n\n\n\n## What should I do if I have a problem\n1. Try to google it before asking. Googling is taking major part of dev work \n2. If you couldn't find answer your question with Google, text your question to [dev](https://t.me/spotnet_dev/4) group with your question.\n3. Do not send DM to maintainer, it would be better and faster to ask other contributors in chat \n\n\n## How to prepare PR\n1. Check if your code [smell](https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/smells) good\n2.  Add `close #<issue number>` to link your issue with your PR\n3.  Do not commit changes which is not related to your task \n4. Check after you created PR, if you committed everything.\n\n## Task description  \n1. Create a `POST /signup` endpoint that accepts only the user's email in the request body:\n```json\n{\n  \"email\": \"user@example.com\"\n}\n```\n\n2. Check if the email already exists in the database (e.g. pre-created by a super admin).\n3. If valid, generate a JWT token that encodes the email.\n4. Send a confirmation email with a link in the following format:\n\n```python\nf'{app_base_url}/signup-confirmation?token={token}'\n```\n\n5. Add `app_base_url` to your settings (if it's not already present).\n6. Do not return any sensitive info in the response.\n7. Add appropriate tests to cover:\n\n   * New signup attempt\n   * Already existing email\n   * Proper link generation\n   * Email delivery trigger\n\n**NOTE: This refers to the admin entity**",

This is great.\n\nI've noticed in my own experimentation, plus reviewing these PRs, that my biggest concern is that we just don't have enough tests. A lot of code is untouched by the test suite. Codecov is not the perfect tool here, because it has a little trouble parsing fypp -> f90, so it marks some lines as not covered that are actually covered. Still, there are things like the output files, the probes, data transfer between simulation -> post_process, and so on. \n\nThe code is not so hard to refactor, but there are some areas that are concerning. I suspect that #914 is a side effect of me or someone else's PR (I could be wrong). This case simply wasn't tested in CI appropriately.\n\nThere is a tango required to get decent tests without overfitting to specific computers or spending 10 hours in CI running (plus another 10 hours queuing in some cases). But I would rather have good tests so we can more confidently refactor and add features than be cavalier about merging quite important changes into the code. \n\nAn example is #907 from @XZTian64 or #855 (and similar) from @Malmahrouqi3 and #901 from me. I'm not fully confident that nothing will go wrong in merging these, despite the tests. The ones that involve writing probes or post_process are most concerning at the moment, I think." ],

I'm not sure if a diff is the best way to go or not (presumably that would go into benchmarking since it would have to be PR vs. Master). \n\nThe easiest way to get a merge in, that could possibly be migrated to benchmarking later, would be to just run the nsys command with appropriate flags, and it will tell you what the most expensive subroutines are. We have some documentation on nsight profiling in the MFC docs `./mfc.sh run <...> --profile` should work I think. But I think that will just create a report file you look at in the GUI.

The directory includes artifacts that meet the CR requirements, along with PGP signatures for every file. I'm fairly sure, given the actual error below, that the artifacts themselves don't matter.\n\nI have the following `jreleaser.toml`:\n\n```\n[deploy.maven.mavenCentral.sonatype]\nactive = \"ALWAYS\"\nsign = false\nurl = \"https://central.sonatype.com/api/v1/publisher\"\nstagingRepositories = [\"build/maven\"]\n```\n\nI run jreleaser:\n\n```\n$ env \\\nJRELEASER_MAVENCENTRAL_USERNAME=\"${MAVEN_CENTRAL_USERNAME}\" \\\nJRELEASER_MAVENCENTRAL_PASSWORD=\"${MAVEN_CENTRAL_PASSWORD}\" \\\nJRELEASER_PROJECT_JAVA_GROUP_ID=\"${JRELEASER_PROJECT_JAVA_GROUP_ID}\" \\\nJRELEASER_PROJECT_VERSION=\"${JRELEASER_PROJECT_VERSION}\" \\\n./jreleaser deploy --config-file=jreleaser.toml\n```\n\n### Expected Behaviour\n\nI'd expect to see `jreleaser` create a bundle and deploy it to Maven Central.\n\n### Actual Behaviour\n\n```\n[INFO]  JReleaser

While it is not explicitly stored in the footer, it can be estimated by analyzing the number of pages via the `OrdinalIndex` and calculating the average page size.  \n\nIt might be worthwhile to include a few functions for inspecting a column's metadata.\n\nFurther more, we can also consider add these column stats into the optimizer statistics system, stored in the `_statistics_.column_statistics` table.\n\n",

Write a brief description of how you will approach the task (without using ChatGPT).\n3. Add your Telegram handler in your application (e.g., in OnlyDust or similar)\n4. Write ETA in your application\n\n\n\n## What should I do if I have a problem\n1. Try to google it before asking. Googling is taking major part of dev work \n2. If you couldn't find answer your question with Google, text your question to [dev](https://t.me/spotnet_dev/4) group with your question.\n3. Do not send DM to maintainer, it would be better and faster to ask other contributors in chat \n\n\n## How to prepare PR\n1. Check if your code [smell](https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/smells) good\n2. Add `close #<issue number>` to link your issue with your PR\n3. Do not commit changes that are unrelated to your task\n4. Check after you created PR, if you committed everything\n\n\n## Task Description\n1. In the [filters folder](./blob/main/margin/margin_app/app/telegram/filters), create a new admin filter that checks the user ID against `ADMIN_IDS` from the settings. If it matches, return `True`.\n2. Create a new handler in [this folder](./blob/main/margin/margin_app/app/telegram/handlers), for example `/admin_check`, that replies with a message like `You are an admin!` or `You aren’t an admin!`, or a similar message conveying the same meaning.\n",

      "description" : "# Fork, Commit, Merge - Medium Issue 2 (React.js)\r\n\r\n## Create a Traffic Light Component\r\n*Note: You don't have ask permission to start solving the issue or get assigned, since these issues are supposed to be always open for new contributors. The actions-user bot will reset the file back to previous state for the next contributor after your commit is merged. So you can just simply start working with the issue right away!*\r\n\r\n### How to get started:\r\n\r\nStart by navigating inside of the directory used in this project with the command:\r\n```bash\r\ncd tasks/react/medium/traffic-light\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen run `npm i` to install Vite, React and all the necessary dependencies for the project.\r\n\r\nAfter installing the dependencies you can open the `src` directory and the `TrafficLight.tsx` file, and start implementing your solution!\r\n\r\n![react-medium](https://github.com/fork-commit-merge/fork-commit-merge/assets/82566656/e154750d-41fd-4db4-bcc6-9dd52c7e55d6)\r\n\r\n### Description:\r\n\r\nCreate a React component using TypeScript that simulates a traffic light. The component should display three lights (red, yellow, and green) and switch between them automatically in the order of a typical traffic light sequence.\r\n\r\n### Requirements:\r\n\r\n-   Implement a `TrafficLight` component in `src/TrafficLight.tsx`.\r\n-   Use TypeScript for type safety.\r\n-   The component should render three circles, colored red, yellow, and green.\r\n-   The traffic light should start with the red light.\r\n-   After a few seconds, it should change to green, then yellow, and then back to red in a continuous loop.\r\n-   Only one light should be \"active\" (brighter) at a time.\r\n\r\nThere are some CSS classes already added for you in the `src/App.css` file, which you can use if you like, or write your own custom CSS.\r\nThere is for example a helper pseudo-class selector for every light that is not active, which will set the light color to gray if the light does not have the `active` class:\r\n\r\n![react-medium-css](https://github.com/fork-commit-merge/fork-commit-merge/assets/82566656/052aaf61-e4d9-40b9-8876-bf96aa2ada9c)\r\n\r\n### Example:\r\n\r\nThe traffic light should cycle as follows:\r\n\r\n-   Red (active) for 4 seconds.\r\n-   Green (active) for 3 seconds.\r\n-   Yellow (active) for 1 second.\r\n-   Repeat the cycle.\r\n\r\n## How to run:\r\nAfter you are done with the card, make sure you are in the `tasks/react/medium/traffic-light` in your terminal and run `npm run dev` to start the Vite server. Then, open \"http://localhost:5173/\" in your browser to check how the app looks.\r\n\r\nIf it looks to be working fine, you are ready to make a pull request!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo work with this issue, you need to have npm and NodeJS installed to your local machine.\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions of installing npm and NodeJS as well as how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Why use Vite?\r\n\r\nThis React project uses Vite for near-instant server start-ups and incredibly fast hot module replacements, providing a smooth and efficient development experience.\r\nAlso Vite requires minimal setup, allowing us to focus on writing React code without getting bogged down in complex configurations.\r\nIf you want to learn more about Vite, check out the documentation:\r\n[Vite Official Documentation](https://vitejs.dev/)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

      "repositoryName" : "dotnet/aspnetcore",
      "description" : "## Summary\n\nAdd a ```blob([mimeType: string])``` method to ```DotNetStreamReference``` in Blazor, allowing developers to obtain a Blob from a .NET stream in JavaScript, without fully loading the stream into memory. We chose this specific issue, because it is a \"good-first-issue\" and we are participating in a germany wide competition, where the subject is to work on issues in open source projects. \nLink to issue: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/47685\n\n## Motivation and goals\n\nBlazor developers can currently pass .NET streams to JavaScript using ```DotNetStreamReference```, which exposes two main methods:\n- ```stream()``` (returns a ReadableStream)\n- ```arrayBuffer()``` (loads the full stream into memory)\n\nThe problem:\n- There is no direct way to obtain a Blob, which is required for many web APIs (like ```<video>``` elements, file downloads or drag-and-drop functionality).\n- ```arrayBuffer()``` is not suitable for large files (like videos) because it fully buffers the stream in memory before use.\n- Using ```stream()``` gives a ReadableStream, but many APIs (like ```<video src=...>```, ```URL.createObjectURL()```) require a Blob, not a stream, and converting a ReadableStream into a Blob in JS is non-trivial and inefficient.\n\nAdding a ```blob()``` method would:\n- Allow efficient handling of large files (like video or audio) without consuming excessive memory.\n- Simplify developer workflows by aligning with common web APIs that expect a Blob.\n- Close a usability gap in the current Blazor-JS interop system.\n\n## In scope\n\n- A new method ```blob([mimeType: string])``` on ```DotNetStreamReference``` that returns a Blob representing the .NET stream.\n- Ensuring the Blob can be used with standard web APIs (e.g., ```<video>```, ```<audio>```, ```URL.createObjectURL()```).\n- Keeping performance and memory usage efficient for large streams.\n\n## Out of scope\n\n- Changes to the existing stream() or arrayBuffer() methods.\n- Polyfills for browsers that lack Blob support (modern browsers are assumed).\n- Enhancements to streaming APIs beyond providing the Blob.\n\n## Risks / unknowns\n- **Browser behavior**: While Blobs are widely supported, the implementation detail of\nstreaming data into a Blob without full buffering might depend on browser internals.\nSome browsers may still buffer the entire Blob in memory before making it available.\n\n- **Memory use**: Even if we avoid buffering in .NET or JS, the underlying browser may still\nend up consuming memory when the Blob is accessed, especially for very large files.\n\n- **Implementation complexity**: Creating a Blob from a .NET stream across JS interop\nmight require platform-level work to ensure true streaming behavior rather than just\nbuffering and converting.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Blazor usage example\n```blazor\n<video @ref=\"videoPlayer\" controls autoplay></video>\n\n<button @onclick=\"PlayVideo\">Play Streamed Video</button>\n\n@code {\n    private ElementReference videoPlayer;\n\n    private async Task PlayVideo()\n    {\n        using var fileStream = File.OpenRead(\"bigvideo.mp4\");\n        var streamRef = new DotNetStreamReference(fileStream);\n\n        // JS call to create a blob URL from the .NET stream\n        var videoUrl = await JS.InvokeAsync<string>(\"createVideoBlobUrl\", streamRef);\n\n        // Set the video source\n        await JS.InvokeVoidAsync(\"setVideoSrc\", videoPlayer, videoUrl);\n    }\n}\n```\n### JavaScript interop\n```JavaScript\nwindow.createVideoBlobUrl = async function (streamRef) {\n    const blob = await streamRef.blob(\"video/mp4\");\n    return URL.createObjectURL(blob);\n};\n\nwindow.setVideoSrc = function (videoElement, src) {\n    videoElement.src = src;\n};\n```\n",

Thank you!\"\n\nOnce you have claimed the issue, please review the syntax of the SQL on the official website of the corresponding database. \nExecute the SQL on the respective database to ensure the correctness of the SQL syntax.\n\nYou can check the corresponding source of each SQL case on the official database website.\nNext, execute the problematic SQL cases mentioned above in the database (you can quickly start the corresponding database using the Docker image for that database, and then connect to it using a client you are  familiar with), to ensure that the SQL syntax itself is correct.\n\n\nOnce you have confirmed the correctness of the SQL syntax, you can validate and fix the grammar parsing issue in ShardingSphere.\n>If you are using IntelliJ IDEA, you will need to install the ANTLR plugin before proceeding.\nIf it is an ANTLR parsing error message, try to repair the `.g4` file by comparing it with the official database syntax until the SQL can be correctly parsed by ANTLR.\nWhen there is no error message in the ANTLR Preview window, it means that ANTLR can correctly parse the SQL.\n\n\nAfter ANTLR parses SQL into an abstract syntax tree, ShardingSphere will access the abstract syntax tree through Visitor and extract the required information.\nIf you need to extract Segments, you need to first execute:\n```shell\nmvn -T 2C clean install -DskipTests\n```\nUnder the shardingsphere-parser module to compile the entire parser module.\nThen rewrite the corresponding visit method in SQLStatementVisitorr as needed to extract the corresponding Segment.\n\n\nAfter the above SQL parsing problem is repaired, the corresponding Test needs to be added.\nThe steps are as follows:\n1. Add the corresponding `sql-case` in the `sql/supported` directory.\n2. Add case assertions in the case directory of the `shardingsphere-test-it-parser` module.\n3. Run `org.apache.shardingsphere.test.it.sql.parser.internal.InternalSQLParserIT`\nAfter SQL Parser IT runs successfully, you can submit a PR.\n\n\n1. Master JAVA language\n2. Have a basic understanding of Antlr g4 file\n3. Be familiar with MySQL SQLs",

      "description" : "### Related page\n\nhttps://mui.com/material-ui/customization/theming/#api\n\n### Kind of issue\n\nUnclear explanations\n\n### Issue description\n\n`createTheme()` function has an unclear warning saying:\n\n> Only the first argument (`options`) is processed by the `createTheme()` function. If you want to actually merge two themes' options and create a new one based on them, you may want to deep merge the two options and provide them as a first argument to the `createTheme()` function.\n\nAlthough, I'm able to correctly override a theme by passing two objects:\n\n```ts\nconst theme = createTheme(\n  {\n    palette: {\n      primary: {\n        // ⬇️ red defined here\n        main: \"#ff4422\",\n      },\n    },\n  },\n  {\n    palette: {\n      primary: {\n        // ⬇️ green overriden here\n        main: \"#00ff00\",\n      },\n    },\n  }\n);\n```\n\nIs this an outdated message? Am I doing or understanding something wrong? \n\nCan you please either provide a clearer example for the warning or update it to reflect the actual code behavior?\n\n\n### Context\n\nSimple reproduction of the example: https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/epic-butterfly-l5mfmt\n\n**Search keywords**: docs theme deepmerge",

It was just a little improvement to process their result faster. ", "> [@nastra](https://github.com/nastra) There is some users which they can have huge table list. It was just a little improvement to process their result faster.\n\nHi @nastra and @ajantha-bhat,\nIt seems that parallel() was added on purpose; therefore, would adding `@SuppressWarnings(\"DangerousParallelStreamUsage\")` be an acceptable solution?\n\nMoreover, do you have any guidance or suggestions on adding a static nested class to address the ImmutableEnumChecker warning in Timestamps#47?\n\nThanks!", ">   On the contrary the implementation of Java parallel streams uses a globally shared ForkJoinPool and does not allow you to provide your own pool. Fork/join pools implement work-stealing, where any thread might steal a task from a different thread's queue when blocked waiting for a subtask to complete. This might not seem like an issue at first glance, but if you use .parallel() for short tasks extensively throughout your codebase and later on you add one piece of code that uses .parallel() for long (e.g. I/O) tasks, the other parts of your codebase that use .parallel(), and that you'd expect to have consistent performance, might experience performance degradation for no apparent reason. The reason is work stealing.\n  You can suppress this warning if you are certain that all your code will always only use .parallel() for short tasks, but even then, you have no real control over the level of parallelism, so you're still better off using MoreStreams (linked above)\n  You can find more info here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/54581148/7182570\n    (see https://github.com/palantir/gradle-baseline#baseline-error-prone-checks)\n\n@talatuyarer can you please double-check whether we should really be using parallel streams there? It would be good to either exclude the warning or remove parallel usage there (I'd prefer to remove it).\n\n\n\n@CuteChuanChuan there's also now the below ones that would be good to fix:\n```\n> Task :iceberg-flink:iceberg-flink-2.0:compileJava\n/Users/eduard.tudenhoefner/Development/workspace/iceberg/flink/v2.0/flink/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/flink/sink/dynamic/DynamicWriter.java:202: warning: [MixedMutabilityReturnType] This method returns both mutable and immutable collections or maps from different paths.

The actions-user bot will reset the file back to previous state for the next contributor after your commit is merged. So you can just simply start working with the issue right away!*\r\n\r\n## How to get started\r\n\r\nStart by opening the `tasks/python/medium` directory from the root of the project. \r\nThen open `bubble_sort.py` file and start working on your solution!\r\n\r\n![python-medium](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/assets/82566656/b32978ed-2a26-48d8-9bd4-322cf1916586)\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThe goal of this issue is to implement the bubble sort algorithm in Python. The function should be able to sort an array of integers in ascending order. You should create a function called `bubble_sort` to accomplish this.\r\n*Note: Do not use the `sort` function or any similar methods to solve this task.*\r\n\r\n## How to run\r\n\r\nMake sure you are in the right directory:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncd tasks/python/medium\r\n```\r\n\r\nExecute the following command to run your Python script:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npython bubble_sort.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected output\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nOriginal array: [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]\r\nSorted array: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the output looks correct, you are ready to make a pull request!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo work with this issue, you need to have Python installed to your local machine.\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions of installing Python and how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

This is either an upstream issue or we might need to switch over to using [proxy-agent](https://www.npmjs.com/package/proxy-agent) from the same maintainer, which proxies \uD83D\uDE02 calls based on the set env-variables.\n\nMid/Long-term, Bitwarden CLI will likely benefit moving over to using native NodeJS fetch support and proxy via [undici](https://github.com/nodejs/undici). I looked into this a while ago, but it hasn't been a priority to migrate.\n\nMarking this as good first issue, in case anyone would like to start investigating.\n\nKind regards,\nDaniel", "@djsmith85 @frq-asgard-josi\n\nI did some digging, and here's my theory.\n\n[proxy-agent](https://github.com/TooTallNate/proxy-agents/blob/main/packages/proxy-agent) depends on [proxy-from-env](https://github.com/Rob--W/proxy-from-env) to process proxy-related environment variables.\n\nThe [logic](https://github.com/Rob--W/proxy-from-env/blob/master/index.js#L64) in `proxy-from-env` for interpreting `NO_PROXY` may be the root cause.\n\n```js\nfunction shouldProxy(hostname, port) {\n  var NO_PROXY =\n    (getEnv('npm_config_no_proxy') || getEnv('no_proxy')).toLowerCase();\n  if (!NO_PROXY) {\n    return true;  // Always proxy if NO_PROXY is not set.\n  }\n  if (NO_PROXY === '*') {\n    return false;  // Never proxy if wildcard is set.\n  }\n}\nfunction getEnv(key) {\n  return process.env[key.toLowerCase()] || process.env[key.toUpperCase()] || '';\n}\n```\n\n`npm_config_no_proxy` has higher priority, and if set, `no_proxy` or `NO_PROXY` won't be effective. This [issue](https://github.com/Rob--W/proxy-from-env/issues/13) and [fix](https://github.com/Rob--W/proxy-from-env/pull/27) are still open.\n" ],

      "url" : "https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/issues/972",
      "repositoryName" : "ethereum/execution-spec-tests",
      "description" : "This is a top-level issue for tracking the manual porting of ethereum/tests test cases to execution-spec-tests:\r\n\r\n> **Contributions to manually port individual test cases are very welcome!**\r\n\r\n**If you're already familiar with ethereum/tests and execution-spec-tests, jump to the issue tracker below!**\r\n\r\n#### Background\r\n[ethereum/tests](https://github.com/ethereum/tests) was the repository used to define EVM test cases from [Frontier](https://ethereum.org/en/history/#frontier) up to and including [The Merge](https://ethereum.org/en/history/#paris). The test cases are defined as YAML (and sometimes JSON) files in the [./src/ sub-directory](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/tree/develop/src) and the JSON \"test fixtures\" (fully-populated tests that can be executed against clients) are generated using [ethereum/retesteth](https://github.com/ethereum/retesteth). These JSON artifacts are regenerated when required and added to the repository, for example, in the [./GeneralStateTests/ sub-directory](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/tree/develop/GeneralStateTests).\r\n\r\nFrom [Shanghai](https://ethereum.org/en/history/#shapella) on, new test cases (in particular for new features included in hard-forks) have been defined in Python in this repository (execution-spec-tests). The existing test cases are still important to execute against clients, however, and porting ethereum/tests to execution-spec-tests ensures that the test cases can be continually maintained and filled (generated) for newer forks. It also has the advantage that client teams will only need to obtain test fixture releases from one source.\r\n\r\n#### Automated Port to Python\r\nAlthough there will be an effort to automate (\"transpile\") the remaining test cases from YAML (respectively JSON) to Python; contributions to manually port individual test cases can be very beneficial and are welcome! \r\n\r\nThe benefits of manual porting are:\r\n1. Reduce the number of test cases by combing multiple YAML (resp. JSON) test cases in one Python test function (via parametrization).\r\n2. Potentially improve coverage by parametrizing the Python version.\r\n3. Code/docstrings are likely higher quality than an automated conversion.\r\n4. The test can be better [organized within the `./tests` folder](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-spec-tests/main/writing_tests/adding_a_new_test/) in execution-spec-tests by the fork and the EIP in which the functionality was introduced.\r\n\r\n#### Process\r\n1. Pick a single or a set of YAML test cases in ethereum/tests to port and create an issue in this repository - optional, but definitely recommended if porting tests from the tracker below to avoid duplicate work.\r\n2. Create a PR with the ported tests:\r\n    a. Add the list of ported YAML files to [converted-ethereum-tests.txt](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/blob/1b30c336eae6b0746ea4db441ac74406f2fb2322/converted-ethereum-tests.txt).\r\n    b. If the tests can't currently be filled, please explain the issue (feel free to also [open a Discussion](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/discussions/new?category=general)).\r\n\r\n#### Help with ethereum/tests\r\n\r\nThe test formats are described in the [ethereum/tests online docs](https://ethereum-tests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/blockchain-ref.html). Note that state filler test cases in YAML can be parametrized, see the [docs here](https://ethereum-tests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/test_filler/state_filler.html#the-indexes).\r\n\r\n#### Hints to Get Started with ethereum/execution-spec-tests\r\n\r\n0. Start here: [Getting Started → Installation](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-spec-tests/main/getting_started/installation/).\r\n1. Use `uv run et make test` to create a template test module (currently a WIP in #950).\r\n2. Where to put the test? See how tests are organized in [Writing Tests → Adding a New Test](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-spec-tests/main/writing_tests/adding_a_new_test/).\r\n3. State vs Blockchain test? If in doubt try to write a state test, see [Writing Tests → Types of Tests → Deciding on a Test Type](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-spec-tests/main/writing_tests/types_of_tests/#deciding-on-a-test-type).\r\n4. Tests are filled via EELS by default (no further installation necessary; it's a Python dependency and got installed in Step 0), see [Filling  → Getting Started](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-spec-tests/main/filling_tests/getting_started/).\r\n5. Parametrizing test functions is encouraged, see [Writing Tests → Writing a New Test → Parametrizing Tests](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-spec-tests/main/writing_tests/writing_a_new_test/#parametrizing-tests).\r\n6. The Opcode mini-lang defined in this repository is the preferred way to define bytecode in tests (if feasible). For a very simple example, see [`test_chainid()`](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/blob/85393456e75f5f3b476cb5e61c35d48172f9d543/tests/istanbul/eip1344_chainid/test_chainid.py#L28) - there are other examples in the tests.\r\n\r\nFeel free to reach out for help or guidance in the Ethereum R&D discord or via DM; see [Getting Help](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-spec-tests/main/getting_started/getting_help/) in the docs.\r\n\r\n```[tasklist]\r\n### Test Cases\r\n- [ ] Add test cases for any single opcode (porting an entire test case from ethereum/tests can be overwhelming;

As which language is spoken is very different for every location, we want a text field, and hope the cms users will fill it with, e.g. \"on thursday afternoon russian, on other days only german an englisch\", or similar.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposed Solution\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of the feature you would like to add, and how it solves the motivating problem. -->\r\nShow the text that can be entered in the cms for every poi containing information about languages in web and native.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered, and why you're proposed solution is better. -->\r\nWe discussed if we just tell the cms users to add this information to the description field, but having this field is a constant reminder and as it is a important feature for the target group, we decided adding this field is the best way to go.\r\n\r\n### User Story\r\n<!-- A clear description of the User Stories that should be achieved by the new feature. The User Stories should follow this pattern:-->\r\nAs a app user I want know if at a poi my language is spoken so that I know if it is worth for me to go there.\r\n\r\n### Additional Context\r\n<!-- Add any other information or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\r\nSee: https://openproject.tuerantuer.org/projects/community-feedback/work_packages/3231/activity\r\n\r\n### Design Requirements\r\n<!-- If the customization includes input from our design team, the detailed requirements will be collected here. Note: These will exist mainly in German to simplify internal communication. -->\r\nNone.\r\n\r\nblocked by https://github.com/digitalfabrik/integreat-cms/issues/2799",

      "description" : "**Describe the bug**\n\n\n**To Reproduce**\n\n1. Checkout and build [Camunda Example Twitter](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/camunda-8-examples/tree/main/twitter-review-java-springboot)\n\n2. Set appropriate configuration properties to connect to your cluster/instance\n```\nzeebe.client.cloud.clusterId=...\nzeebe.client.cloud.clientId=SJqG7ve....\nzeebe.client.cloud.clientSecret=...\nzeebe.client.cloud.region=...\nzeebe.client.cloud.auth-url=...\nzeebe.client.cloud.base-url=...\n```\n\n3. Set environment variable \n```\nZEEBE_CLIENT_CONFIG_PATH=/tmp\n```\n\n4. Run the application and see some errors on the console regarding authentication issues.\n\n```\nat io.camunda.zeebe.client.impl.ZeebeClientFutureImpl.join(ZeebeClientFutureImpl.java:52) ~[zeebe-client-java-8.6.7.jar:8.6.7]\n\t... 32 common frames omitted\nCaused by: io.grpc.StatusRuntimeException: UNAUTHENTICATED: HTTP status code 401\ninvalid content-type: text/html\nheaders: Metadata(:status=401,date=Fri, 24 Jan 2025 14:49:06 GMT,content-type=text/html,www-authenticate=Bearer token_type=\"JWT\",strict-transport-security=max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains,content-length=172)\nDATA-----------------------------\n<html>\n<head><title>401 Authorization Required</title></head>\n<body>\n<center><h1>401 Authorization Required</h1></center>\n<hr><center>nginx</center>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n**Expected behavior**\n\nFor a better developer experience, the client should at least log an error to the console. But ideally should abort the bootstrapping with a useful error message mentioning which property is wrongly configured.\n\n**Log/Stacktrace**\n\n\n\uD83D\uDC40 \n**We do indeed raise an exception, when a directory is configured instead of a file (see [here](https://github.com/camunda/camunda/blob/ed8a807969f040fdb55b575a9e31fef957fd8d5e/clients/java/src/main/java/io/camunda/zeebe/client/impl/oauth/OAuthCredentialsProviderBuilder.java#L251)) and\nthe exception bubbles up to `PropertyUtil.java` (see [here](https://github.com/camunda/camunda/blob/cbef3b18134bbd4198456c293206bef2eab726f9/clients/spring-boot-starter-camunda-sdk/src/main/java/io/camunda/zeebe/spring/client/configuration/PropertyUtil.java#L98)) where the error is logged with `DEBUG` level!**\n\uD83D\uDC40 \n\nThus in order to see the message on the console the log level of the spring application needs to be changed\n(You will still see a lot of noise on the log, because the client still continues to bootstrap)\n\n```\nlogging.level.root=DEBUG\n```\n\nSee stack trace and error message below.\n\n<details><summary>Full Stacktrace</summary>\n

It would be a great idea to formalise this as a trait. By doing so:\n- We can reference this method without the compiler needing to know what type it is\n- We can ensure that this behaviour is guaranteed across vector stores.\n\nThis would also be a good chance to implement a new, different type of `insert_docs` method that also takes a user-defined ID generation strategy (although perhaps out of initial scope for the first PR).\n\n### Motivation\n<!--\nPlease describe the use case(s) or other motivation for the new feature.\n-->\nBetter UX, better type reusability.\n\n### Proposal\n<!--\nHow should the new feature be implemented, and why? Add any considered\ndrawbacks.\n-->\nMove all `insert_document` methods under a new `InsertDocuments` trait.\n\n### Alternatives\n<!--\nAre there other ways to solve this problem that you've considered? What are\ntheir potential drawbacks? Why was the proposed solution chosen over these\nalternatives?\n-->\n",

This can result in a token length that exceeds the limits set by the system. Here are some steps you can take to address this issue:您在使用 Dify 中的 Volcengine 插件时遇到的 \"标记太长 \"错误可能与处理大数据输入（如转换为 base64 编码的图像）有关。这可能导致标记长度超出系统设置的限制。以下是解决此问题的一些步骤：\n> \n> 1. **Reduce Image Size**: Try reducing the size of the images before uploading them to Dify. This can help prevent the base64 encoded data from exceeding the token limit.**减小图片大小 **：在将图片上传到 Dify 之前，请尝试减小图片大小。这有助于防止 base64 编码数据超出令牌限制。\n> 2. **Check Token Limits**: Ensure that the token limits for your model and API requests are configured correctly. Dify imposes a generation length limit of 2k tokens for reasoning models, which might be relevant if your workflow involves such models [[1]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/17120).**检查令牌限制 **：确保正确配置模型和 API 请求的令牌限制。Dify 为推理模型规定了 2k 标记的生成长度限制，如果您的工作流涉及此类模型，则可能与此相关 [[1]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/17120) 。\n> 3. **Switch Model Provider**: If you're using the `openai_api_compatible` provider, consider switching to a different model provider that might handle larger token sizes more effectively [[2]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/18657).**切换模型提供程序 **：如果您正在使用 `openai_api_compatible` 提供程序，请考虑切换到不同的模型提供程序，这样可以更有效地处理更大的标记大小 [[2]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/18657) 。\n> 4. **Review Workflow Configuration**: Double-check your workflow configuration to ensure that all parameters and settings are optimized for handling the data sizes you're working with.**审查工作流程配置 **：仔细检查您的工作流程配置，确保所有参数和设置都经过优化，以处理您正在处理的数据大小。\n> \n> By implementing these suggestions, you should be able to mitigate the \"token too long\" error and improve the stability of your plugin operations.通过实施这些建议，您应该可以减少 \"标记太长 \"错误，并提高插件运行的稳定性。\n> \n> _To continue talking to [Dosu](https://dosu.dev), mention [@dosu](https://github.com/dosu).要继续与 [Dosu](https://dosu.dev) 通话，请提及 。_\n> \n> Help Dosu learn!

You may also want to browse the [Gemma Cookbook](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemma-cookbook) for further inspiration.\n\n> Star the project to boost it! :star:\n\n## \uD83D\uDCA1 What You Could Build\n\nGemma 3n is specifically designed for low-resource (on-device) environments and is a **multimodal model** that supports text, image, video, and audio inputs — so we’d love to see projects where those capabilities shine! ✨ We highly recommend checking out the [blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/gemma3n) to better understand the possibilities and spark your creativity.\n\nYou could:\n- Showcase agentic or interactive uses of the model\n- Build recipes using `transformers`, `llama.cpp`, or `transformers.js`\n- Create fine-tuning notebooks for domain-specific tasks using any of the supported modalities\n- Or anything else that pushes the boundaries of on-device and multimodal AI! \uD83E\uDD16\n\nHave your own idea?\uD83D\uDCA1 Even better, we’d love to hear it!\n\n## \uD83D\uDCDD How to Contribute\n\n1. **Open a New Issue**\n   - If you’re interested in contributing, please [open a new issue](#) with a descriptive title.\n   - Use the issue to outline your idea and gather early feedback.\n\n2. **Let Us Know**\n   - Comment on this post to let us know you’ve opened a new issue. We’ll update the main list with a link to your idea.\n\n3. **Start Building**\n   - Once you’ve shaped your plan, go ahead and implement your idea \uD83D\uDC68‍\uD83D\uDCBB.\n\n4. **Submit a Pull Request**\n   - When you’re ready, open a Pull Request (PR) that links back to your issue.\n   - Mention the issue in your PR description so it's easy to track.\n\n5. **Update the README**\n   - Don’t forget to add a short description of your contribution to the `README.md`, so others can find and reuse it easily.\n\n## \uD83D\uDCAC For New Contributors\n\nIf you’re just starting out in open source, we recommend reading our [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface-gemma-recipes/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md). It includes helpful tips to get you up and running.\n\nWe can’t wait to see what we’ll build together! \uD83E\uDD20\n",

      "description" : "Many of our unit tests compute the 2-norm of an error vector and compare it to a given tolerance. To this aim, unfortunately, they often convert a Psydac vector to a NumPy array, which is unnecessarily expensive:\n```python\nerror = a - b\nassert np.linalg.norm(error.toarray()) < TOL\n```\nInstead, the same result can be obtained by using the method `inner` of our `Vector` objects, without any unnecessary memory allocation:\n```python\n# Define 2-norm of vector using inner\nnorm2 = lambda v: sqrt(v.inner(v))\n\nerror = a - b\nassert norm2(error) < TOL\n```",

      "comments" : [ "While refactoring the `test_operator_evaluation` function (`/linalg/tests/test_linalg.py`) to remove all `.toarray() `(to better leverage PSYDAC’s native vector/matrix structures and improve efficiency), I noticed that the current computation of the variable `error_est` relies on a full dense inverse via:\n\n```\nBmat = B.toarray()\n\nB_inv_mat = np.linalg.inv(Bmat)\nb_inv_arr = np.matrix.flatten(B_inv_mat)\nerror_est = 2 + n1 * n2 * np.max([np.abs(b_inv_arr[i]) for i in range(len(b_inv_arr))])\n\n```\nSince we’re avoiding those dense NumPy operations for performance and memory reasons, I believe this calculation of `error_est` no longer fits well in the new context. Computing the full inverse matrix is computationally expensive and somewhat contradictory to the iterative sparse methods we’re testing.\n\nCould you suggest an alternative approach for `error_est`?\nFor example, I’m considering replacing it with a simpler, lightweight estimate such as:\n\n`error_est = {some num > 0}* n1 * n2`\n", "This is an error estimate based on the maximum absolute value of the inverse matrix. It could read in fact\n```python\nerror_est = np.linalg.norm(Bmat.flat, np.inf)\n```\nwhich is the inf-norm of the vectorized matrix. This does not seem to give a sharp estimate, given that it is multiplied by a small number just below (`tol = 1e-5`). Maybe @jowezarek could shed some light on this?", "@anushkasinghh @yguclu \nThanks for bringing this up, this code snipped is ridiculously complicated and doesn't do what it's supposed to do :')\n\nThe explicit matrix inverse was never truly needed, and yet there's no time to gain as the entire test ran in < 3 seconds on my machine.\n\nThis particular part of the test was designed to test whether power operations (**0, **1, **2) work with inverse linear operators (ILOs).\n\nThe poorly executed idea of the test was the following:\n```python\n# arbitrary tolerance\ntol = \n\n# Define 2-norm of vector using inner (as proposed by Yaman)\nnorm2 = lambda v: sqrt(v.inner(v))\n\n# Psydac objects, solver with tolerance = tol\nu\nB_ILO = inverse(B, 'cg', tol=tol)\n\n# First test: Check whether B_ILO**0 is the identity matrix (B_ILO**0 = id?)\n\nerror = (B_ILO**0) @ u - u\nassert norm2(error) < 1e-15 # error should really be zero\n\n# Second test: Check whether B_ILO**1 really computes the inverse up to accuracy (B_ILO**1 = B_ILO?)\n# I.e., we expect B @ B_ILO**1 @ u to be equal to u + err, err a vector of norm less than tol\n\nerror = B @ B_ILO**1 @ u - u\nassert norm2(error) < tol\n\n# Third test: Now checking whether B_ILO**2 is really equal to a double application of B_ILO (B_ILO**2 = B_ILO @ B_ILO?)\n# B @ B @ B_ILO @ B_ILO @ u = B @ ( B_ILO @ u + err1 ) = u + err2 + B @ err1\n# where both err1 and err2 are vectors of norm less than tol, hence\n# | B @ B @ B_ILO @ B_ILO @ u - u | = | err2 + B @ err1 | < | err2 | + | B @ err1 | < tol + |B|_{inf} * tol = (1 + |B|_{inf}) * tol\n\nadjusted_tol = ( 1 + np.max(np.abs(B.toarray())) ) * tol\nerror = B @ B @ B_ILO**2 @ u - u\nassert norm2(error) < adjusted_tol" ],

We can replace this popup with a full page that we already use as confirmation.**\n\n**Your task will be to check that all the issues have been correctly developed, that the components are properly arranged, and that everything matches exactly as in the Figma design:**\n\nhttps://www.figma.com/design/S1UKYgWewNqNHZFAaBUilG/%F0%9F%8F%9D%EF%B8%8F-Starknet-ID?node-id=7022-31922&t=XCt8XQUo4vZRtmIv-1\n\n### Purpose of the Issue\nThe goal of this issue is to finalize the redesign of the confirmation page that appears after activating a subscription on the Starknet ID platform. The current popup will be replaced with a full confirmation page, ensuring all components are properly developed and aligned with the Figma design.\n\n- **Alignment with Figma Design**:\n  - Check that all components are correctly arranged and match exactly as shown in the Figma file linked in the issue description.\n\n### Actions to Take\n1. **Review Sub-Issues**:\n   - Verify that each sub-issue (#1110–#1114) has been implemented according to specifications.\n   \n2. **Testing**:\n   - Test all functionalities locally, including navigation, button redirects, and visual alignment.\n   \n3. **Final Adjustments**:\n   - Ensure consistency across all elements (images, text, buttons) and fix any discrepancies between the implementation and the Figma design.\n\n4. **Commit and Submit**:\n   - Create a final commit summarizing changes (e.g., `git commit -m \"Final review: confirmation page redesign\"`).\n   - Submit a pull request for review and approval.\n\n### Constraints\n- All components must strictly follow the Figma design.\n- Testing should cover both functionality and visual accuracy.\n- This issue serves as a final review, so attention to detail is critical.\n\n\n## Proposed Actions \uD83D\uDEE0️\n\nHere’s a checklist of actions to follow for resolving this issue:\n\n1. **Fork and Create Branch**:  \n   Fork the repository and create a new branch using the issue number:\n   ```bash\n   git checkout -b fix-[issue-number]\n   ```\n\n2. **Implement Changes**:  \n\t[Insert Code snippet if needed with a mardown todo list]\n\n3. **Run Tests and Commit Changes**:  \n   Make sure your changes don't break existing functionality and commit with a clear message:\n   ```bash\n   git commit -m \"Fix: [Short description of the fix]\"\n   ```\n\n## Required \uD83D\uDCCB\n\nTo keep our workflow smooth, please make sure you follow these guidelines:\n\n- **Assignment**: Don't create a pull request if you weren’t assigned to this issue.\n- **Timeframe**: Complete the task within **3 business days**.\n- **Closing the Issue**: In your PR description, close the issue by writing `Close #[issue_id]`.\n- **Review Process**:\n  - Once you've submitted your PR, change the label to **\"ready for review\"**.\n  - If changes are requested, address them and then update the label back to **\"ready for review\"** once done.\n- **Testing**: Test your PR locally before pushing, and verify that tests and build are working after pushing.\n\nThank you for your contribution \uD83D\uDE4F\n\n⚠️ WARNING: Failure to follow the requirements above may result in being added to the OnlyDust blacklist, affecting your ability to receive future rewards.\n",

This leads to the error: \"your wallet is not yet initialized, please make a transaction (sending ETH to yourself works) to initialize it.\" To support undeployed accounts, we propose directly verifying the signature using the public key (account address), bypassing the need to interact with the account's contract.**\n\n## Proposed Actions \uD83D\uDEE0️\n\nHere’s a checklist of actions to follow for resolving this issue:\n\n1. **Fork and Create Branch**:  \n   Fork the repository and create a new branch using the issue number:\n   \n```bash\n   git checkout -b fix-[issue-number]\n```\n\n2. **Implement Changes**:  \n- [ ] Create a utility function to verify Starknet signatures using public keys directly.\n- [ ] Integrate this function as a fallback when account is not yet deployed.\n- [ ] Detect if an account is deployed or not before calling `is_valid_signature`.\n- [ ] Add error handling and logging for both methods of verification.\n- [ ] Write unit tests for both deployed and undeployed account scenarios.\n\nExample snippet for direct signature verification:\n```python\ndef verify_signature(pubkey, message_hash, signature):\n    # Apply Starknet signature verification logic using elliptic curve math\n    return starknet_ec_verify(pubkey, message_hash, signature)\n```\n\n3. **Run Tests and Commit Changes**:  \n   Make sure your changes don't break existing functionality and commit with a clear message:\n   \n```bash\n   git commit -m \"Fix: Allow signature verification for undeployed Starknet accounts\"\n```\n\n## Required \uD83D\uDCCB\n\nTo keep our workflow smooth, please make sure you follow these guidelines:\n\n- **Assignment**: Don't create a pull request if you weren’t assigned to this issue.\n- **Timeframe**: Complete the task within **3 business days**.\n- **Closing the Issue**: In your PR description, close the issue by writing Close #[issue_id].\n- **Review Process**:\n  - Once you've submitted your PR, change the label to **\"ready for review\"**.\n  - If changes are requested, address them and then update the label back to **\"ready for review\"** once done.\n- **Testing**: Test your PR locally before pushing, and verify that tests and build are working after pushing.\n\nThank you for your contribution \uD83D\uDE4F\n\n⚠️ WARNING: Failure to follow the requirements above may result in being added to the OnlyDust blacklist, affecting your ability to receive future rewards.",

Especially when you have a long list of layers, its quite tedious to move the mouse cursor down without leaving the hover state. A transition or transition-delay would help, however I have been unable to implement this with pure css. \n\nI have found a workaround by triggering the collapse manually, however its causes other issues, like re-entering while not clearing older timeouts. Probably needs a debounce fn.\nhttps://plnkr.co/edit/WQyfFctUqs7mNdq9\n\nOn another note, a collapseDelay option would work really well to make it customizable.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nLayer control stays for 1-2 seconds after leaving hover state.\n\n### Current behavior\n\nLayer control disappears instantly after leaving hover state\n\n### Minimal example reproducing the issue\n\n_No response_\n\n### Environment\n\n- Leaflet version: 1.9.3\n- Browser (with version): Chrome\n- OS/Platform (with version): Mac/Windows latest\n",

This image will be used by all SCORE-related repositories (dozens in total), so it must be robust, reusable, and actively maintained.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Current Situation\n\nWe currently require a number of tools to be installed in addition to Bazel. This includes Python, Graphviz, Bazelisk, and shell autocompletion for Bazel. These tools are not always easy to install correctly across different systems, especially for new contributors.\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDE80 Solution\n\nImplement a reusable Devcontainer setup based on a Docker image that includes all required tools preinstalled. The image should be published to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) and referenced via `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` or `.devcontainer.json` in consuming repositories.\n\n**Target image name:** `ghcr.io/eclipse-score/devcontainer`\n\nThe base image should include:\n\n- Based on an extended Ubuntu image, quite certainly:\n  - `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/python:1.2-3.12`\n- Preinstalled tools:\n  - Python (needed for Bazel formatting bug workaround)\n  - Graphviz\n  - Bazelisk (with current bazel version pre-downloaded)\n  - Shell autocompletion for Bazel\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDEE0️ Concrete Tasks\n\n- [ ] Create a new GitHub repository (name: `eclipse-score/devcontainer`)\n- [ ] Create a `Dockerfile` that installs all required tools\n- [ ] Add GitHub Actions workflow to:\n  - Build the image\n  - Optional: Tag it with semantic version (e.g. `v1.0.0`) and `latest`\n  - Push to GHCR under `ghcr.io/eclipse-score/devcontainer`\n- [ ] Optional: Add typical metadata to the container\n- [ ] Use the image from GHCR in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` or `.devcontainer.json` in at least one repo (e.g. `score`)\n- [ ] Verify that all tools are functional inside the container\n- [ ] Optional: Add documentation (`README.md`) to `eclipse-score/devcontainer`\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDD04 Considered Alternatives\n\nSome tools could theoretically be installed via Bazel, but this was previously evaluated and rejected due to high implementation and maintenance cost. We chose to use system-level tools with clear documentation instead.\n\n---\n\n### \uD83E\uDDE0 Notes\n\n- The image will become the base for all development work across the SCORE ecosystem\n- Keep it generic, stable, and easy to extend.\n- This devcontainer will remain entirely optional, it's just meant to ease the pain of installing all the required tools.\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDCDA References\n\n- Example: [`eclipse-score/score/.devcontainer`](https://github.com/eclipse-score/score/tree/main/.devcontainer)\n- Docs: [Development Environment Setup](https://eclipse-score.github.io/score/main/contribute/development/development_environment.html#autocompletion-in-the-shell)\n",

      "description" : "### Prerequisites\n\n- [x] I have searched for [existing issues](https://github.com/rarfell/dimeApp/issues) that already include this feature request, without success.\n\n### Describe the Feature Request\n\nI’d love to have a feature that allows users to set customizable reminder notifications a few days before a recurring expense, especially for subscriptions. This way users get a heads-up and have a chance to cancel before the payment goes through.\n\n### Describe the Use Case\n\nI add a recurring subscription payment (e.g. Spotify on the 15th of each month).\nI'd like the option to set a reminder X days before (e.g. 3 days before), so Dime sends me a notification like:\n\n“Your Spotify subscription is going to renew in 3 days — consider canceling if you don’t need it.”\n\nThis reduces the risk of forgetting to cancel and incurring charges for services I don’t use anymore.\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_",

In this case, I don't want to bother adding an expense monthly or ending this recurring expense while keeping it in my mind.\n\nAnyway, thanks for the app; I loved it at first glance.\n" ],

This email verification input field appears after providing the correct username and password. \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Freshly install the Commons App\n2. Open the app and try to log in with your username and password\n3. An email verification input field should appear\n4. Make sure email verification input field is focused\n5. Tap on the `Enter` button in the software keyboard of Android\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nThe **IME Action** for the email verification input field should be either `Done` or `Go`. Also, the input field's height shouldn't increase when pressing the `Enter` button.\n\n### Actual behaviour\n\nThe `Enter` **IME Action** is displayed in the Android's soft keyboard, and tapping that increases the input field's height.\n\n### Device name\n\nPixel 6\n\n### Android version\n\nAndroid 14\n\n### Commons app version\n\nMain Branch\n\n### Device logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### Screen-shots\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7177768-7721-405e-a838-90b12a1a6a9c\n\n### Would you like to work on the issue?\n\nPrefer not",

Forked and cloned the repository, then searched the codebase for `readline` usage to find the core input handling logic.\n2.  Identified `useKeypress.ts` (for raw keypress events) and `InputPrompt.tsx` (for input logic) as the key files.\n3.  To see what the application receives, I temporarily modified the code to log every keypress event to a `debug.log` file.\n4.  **Key Finding:** My initial debugging proved that on a default macOS Terminal, `Shift+Enter` sends the exact same sequence (`\\r`) as a regular `Enter` press, making the two indistinguishable.\n\n### Attempted Fix & The Final Discovery\n\nBased on the initial finding, I attempted a code-only fix by teaching the application to listen for a different key combination, `Shift+Down`, which often sends a unique sequence on other terminals.\n\n1. The Code I Tested\nI modified `useKeypress.ts` to listen for the `Shift+Down` sequence (`\\x1b[1;2B`) and `InputPrompt.tsx` to handle a `key.shift` flag.\n\n```typescript\n// In useKeypress.ts, I added a check:\nif (key.sequence === '\\x1b[1;2B') {\n  key.name = 'return';\n  key.shift = true;\n}\n```\n```typescript\n// In InputPrompt.tsx, I added the key.shift check:\nif (key.ctrl || key.meta || key.shift || charBefore === '\\\\' || key.paste) {\n  // ... newline logic\n}\n```\n\n2. The Result: It Also Failed\nThis proof-of-concept did not work. To understand why, I used the `cat` command to see what my terminal was actually sending when I pressed `Shift+Down`.\nFinal Proof: The terminal sent `^[[B`, which is the standard escape code for a plain Cursor Down key.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis investigation leads to a definitive conclusion: the default macOS Terminal is more limited than anticipated. It appears to strip the `Shift` modifier information from both the `Enter` key and the arrow keys, making a code-only fix for a `Shift+Key` newline combination unfeasible on this specific platform, although i think this might work on other platforms which by default register shift + down as '\\x1b[1;2B' but i cant really test it.\n\nThis might explain why `Ctrl+J` is a common suggested alternative, as it sends a universal newline character (`\\n`) that doesn't rely on modifier key parsing.\n\nAs this is my first contribution, my analysis could be wrong, and I apologize for the detailed-but-failed attempt. Given these findings, what is the desired path forward? Any information from the internal `b.corp.google.com` link about how other terminals are supported would still be very helpful.\n\nThank you for your time and guidance.", "Just to add, I personally use the Warp Terminal on Mac.

Support basic entity types: PERSON, ORGANIZATION, LOCATION, DATE, EMAIL, PHONE\n2. Support keyword extraction using TF-IDF or similar algorithms\n3. Make this an optional feature with its own dependency group\n4. Results should include entity type, text, and position information\n5. Support custom entity patterns via regex\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n- Add optional dependency group:\n  ```toml\n  optional-dependencies.entity-extraction = [\n    \"gliner>=0.2.0\",  # State-of-the-art zero-shot NER, outperforms spaCy\n    \"keybert>=0.8.0\",  # Most accurate keyword extraction\n  ]\n  ```\n- **Library Choice Rationale**: \n  - Use GLiNER for NER based on 2024 benchmarks showing superior zero-shot performance and flexibility compared to spaCy\n  - Use KeyBERT for keyword extraction as it provides the highest accuracy among RAKE, YAKE, and KeyBERT\n- Add to `ExtractionConfig`:\n  ```python\n  extract_entities: bool = False\n  extract_keywords: bool = False\n  keyword_count: int = 10\n  custom_entity_patterns: dict[str, str] | None = None  # {\"INVOICE_ID\": r\"INV-\\d+\"}\n  ```\n- Add to `ExtractionResult`:\n  ```python\n  entities: list[Entity] | None = None\n  keywords: list[tuple[str, float]] | None = None  # (keyword, score)\n  ```\n- Create `kreuzberg/_entity_extraction.py` module\n- Define `Entity` dataclass with `type`, `text`, `start`, `end` fields\n\n**Testing Requirements:**\n- Test entity extraction on various document types\n- Test custom pattern matching\n- Test keyword extraction with different document lengths\n- Mock spacy models in unit tests\n- Test handling of missing dependencies\n- Verify performance impact is acceptable",

Please do some research to make sure that replacing `Update` with `Patch` does not change the behavior of current impl.\n2. If is possible to using `Patch`, then refactor the code in this package. \n3. Pass the test in this package.\n4. Update the `charts/hami/templates/scheduler/clusterrole.yaml` file after that pull request merged.\n\n**Who can join or take the task**:\n\nThe good first issue is intended for `first-time contributors` to get started on his/her contributor journey.\n\n**How to join or take the task**:\n\nJust reply on the issue with the message `/assign` in a separate line.\n\nThen, the issue will be assigned to you.\n\n**How to ask for help**:\n\nIf you need help or have questions, please feel free to ask on this issue.\nThe issue author or other members of the community will guide you through the contribution process.",

I don't know exactly.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. add proxy-cache plugin to a route\r\n2. run curl command with compression enabled\r\n   ```console\r\n   curl --compressed https://example.com/api/healthz -v --output -\r\n   ```\r\n4. run curl command without compression right afterwards\r\n   ```console\r\n   curl https://example.com/api/healthz -v --output -\r\n   ```\r\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\nThis is my Kubernetes resource:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\napiVersion: configuration.konghq.com/v1\r\nkind: KongPlugin\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: my-cache-1min\r\n  namespace: my-api-v4\r\nconfig:\r\n  cache_ttl: 60\r\n  content_type:\r\n    - text/plain\r\n    - application/json\r\n    - application/json; charset=utf-8\r\n  request_method:\r\n    - GET\r\n    - HEAD\r\n  response_code:\r\n    - 200\r\n  ignore_uri_case: true\r\n  strategy: memory\r\nplugin: proxy-cache\r\n```",

You can try the following methods to deal with this issue:\n\n1. Reduce the training batch size `per_device_train_batch_size: 1`\n2. Replace compute kernels `enable_liger_kernel: true` and `use_unsloth_gc: true`\n3. Reduce the maximum sequence length `cutoff_len: 512`\n4. Use DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 or FSDP to partition model weights on multiple devices or use CPU offloading\n5. Set `quantization_bit: 4` to quantize model parameters (only compatible with LoRA tuning)\n6. Use the paged optimizer `optim: paged_adamw_8bit`\n\n模型训练时显存溢出，通常是由于当前某个设备的剩余显存不足以完成计算任务。可尝试下述方法解决：\n\n1. 降低批处理大小 `per_device_train_batch_size: 1`\n2. 替换模型算子 `enable_liger_kernel: true` 和 `use_unsloth_gc: true`\n3. 降低最大序列长度 `cutoff_len: 512`\n4. 使用 DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 或 FSDP 将模型权重拆分到多个设备或使用 CPU Offloading\n5. 设置 `quantization_bit: 4` 量化模型参数（仅限于 LoRA 方法）\n6. 使用分页低精度优化器 `optim: paged_adamw_8bit`\n\n----\n\n### Unsatisfying fine-tuning results / 微调效果无法令人满意\n\nUnsatisfying fine-tuning results are usually due to insufficient training samples, leading to underfitting. You can try the following methods to deal with this issue:\n\n1. Increase the size of the training dataset\n2. Increase the number of epochs `num_train_epochs: 5.0` or steps `max_steps: 1000`\n3. Use a larger learning rate `learning_rate: 2.0e-4`\n4. Use different fine-tuning method `finetuning_type: freeze` or `finetuning_type: full`\n\n微调效果较差，通常是由于训练样本过少，导致模型欠拟合。可尝试下述方法解决：\n\n1. 增加训练数据集的大小\n2. 提高训练轮数 `num_train_epochs: 5.0` 或步数 `max_steps: 1000`\n3. 增大学习率 `learning_rate: 2.0e-4`\n4. 使用不同的微调方法 `finetuning_type: freeze` 或 `finetuning_type: full`\n\n----\n\n### Corrupted or repeated model responses / 胡乱或重复的模型回答\n\nIf this issue occurs before training, it is usually due to using an unaligned (base) model or a mismatched `template`. Please ensure an aligned (instruct/chat) model and correct `template` are used.\nIf this issue occurs after training, please check if the `template` used for training and inference is consistent. And do not forget to check if the overfitting appeared. You can try decreasing the number of epochs `num_train_epochs` and learning rate `learning_rate` to deal with the overfitting issue.\n\n若该问题发生在训练之前，通常是由于使用了未经对齐（base）的模型或不恰当的模板 `template`，请保证使用对齐后（instruct/chat）的模型和正确的模板 `template`。\n若该问题发生在训练之后，请检查训练和推理使用的模板 `template` 是否一致，同时检查是否发生了过拟合。如果发生了过拟合，请减小训练轮数 `num_train_epochs` 和学习率 `learning_rate`。\n\n----\n\n### Training hangs / 训练进程卡住\n\nIf distributed training was not enabled, please use the following command to check if the CUDA version of PyTorch is installed correctly:\n\n如果没有使用分布式训练，请使用下述命令检查 CUDA 版本的 PyTorch 是否被正确安装：\n\n```bash\npython -c \"import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())\"\n```\n\nIf distributed training was enabled, try setting the environment variable `export NCCL_P2P_LEVEL=NVL`.\n\n如果使用了分布式训练，请尝试设置环境变量 `export NCCL_P2P_LEVEL=NVL`。\n\n----\n\n### LLaMA Board cannot display datasets / LLaMA Board 无法显示数据集\n\nPlease ensure that the working directory when launching the LLaMA Board is the same as the LLaMA-Factory directory.\n\n请确保启动 LLaMA Board 时的工作目录与 LLaMA-Factory 主目录一致。\n\n----\n\n### How to shard model weights on multiple devices / 如何模型权重拆分到多个设备上\n\nDuring the training phase, please refer to the [examples](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory/blob/main/examples/README.md#supervised-fine-tuning-with-deepspeed-zero-3-weight-sharding) about how to use the DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 (recommended) or FSDP.\nDuring the inference phase, please use vLLM to enable the tensor parallelism: [examples](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory/tree/main/examples#inferring-lora-fine-tuned-models).\n\n在训练阶段，请参考 [examples](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory/blob/main/examples/README_zh.md#%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8-deepspeed-zero-3-%E5%B9%B3%E5%9D%87%E5%88%86%E9%85%8D%E6%98%BE%E5%AD%98) 使用 DeepSpeed ZeRO-3（推荐）或 FSDP。\n在推理阶段，请使用 vLLM 来开启张量并行：[examples](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory/blob/main/examples/README_zh.md#%E6%8E%A8%E7%90%86-lora-%E6%A8%A1%E5%9E%8B).\n\n----\n\n### How to use ORPO or SimPO / 如何使用 ORPO 或 SimPO\n\nModify the `pref_loss` in [example script](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory/blob/main/examples/train_lora/llama3_lora_dpo.yaml) to `orpo` or `simpo`.\n\n将[示例脚本](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory/blob/main/examples/train_lora/llama3_lora_dpo.yaml) 中的 `pref_loss` 改为 `orpo` 或 `simpo`。\n\n----\n\n### How to debug with VSCode / 如何用 VSCode 调试程序\n\nSee #5337\n\n----\n\n### Why the number of examples is small in pre-training / 为什么预训练样本数比实际的少\n\nWe automatically use packing in pre-training, where we concatenate multiple samples into one sequence, so the number of examples displayed is less than the actual number.\n\n我们在预训练时候自动使用了 Packing，将多个样本打包成一条序列，因此显示的样本数量会比实际的少。\n\n----\n\n### Will the training data be shuffled / 训练数据是否会被打乱\n\nLLaMA-Factory will randomly shuffle the training data by default. You can use `disable_shuffling` to turn off the shuffling.\n\nLLaMA-Factory 默认会随机打乱训练数据，可使用 `disable_shuffling` 关闭打乱。\n\n----\n\n### How to enable streaming / 如何启用流式数据读取\n\nWe recommend shuffling the dataset before training if you want to use streaming. Add the following arguments to your yaml file.\n\n如果您希望使用流式数据读取，请在训练前手动打乱数据。将下面的参数添加到 YAML 文件中。\n\n```yaml\nbuffer_size: 128\npreprocessing_batch_size: 128\nstreaming: true\naccelerator_config:\n  dispatch_batches: false\n```\n\n----\n\n### How to resolve `Processor was not found` / 如何解决 `Processor was not found`\n\nPlease run the following code and paste the full error log to Issue.\n\n请运行下面的代码并粘贴完整报错信息到 Issue。\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoProcessor\nprocessor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(\"path-to-your-model\")\n```\n\n----\n\n> [!TIP]\n> If the problems still exist with the **latest** code, please create an issue.\n> 若使用**最新的**代码仍然无法解决问题，请创建一个 issue。\n",

Click any \"First name\" cell once without activating edit mode\n3. Press any key, app crashes with error `Cannot destructure property 'value' of 'params.props' as it is undefined.`\n\nNote that if you set `age` column's `preProcessEditCellProps` to just return `return params;`, it still crashes but now you get internal datagrid error:\n```ts\nCannot read properties of undefined (reading 'value')\n    at eval (https://2rmfqs.csb.app/node_modules/\nmui/x-data-grid/esm/hooks/features/editing/useGridRowEditing.js:374:44\n```\n\n\n### Current behavior\n\nIf column definition has\n1. `preProcessEditCellProps` defined\n2. `editable: true`\n\nand column cell is set as non-editable by DataGrid prop `isCellEditable` returning `false` for that field, `preProcessEditCellProps` is still called if user edits any cell by starting typing on cell before edit mode is activated.\n\nThis results in `params.props` being undefined (in `preProcessEditCellProps`) and causes app to crash.\n\nThis is extension of recently fixed bug https://github.com/mui/mui-x/issues/17298 \n\n### Expected behavior\n\n`preProcessEditCellProps` should not be called for the column if the cell in question is disabled via DataGrid's `isCellEditable` prop, even if column itself has `editable: true` set (I believe cell editability should have higher priority than column editability)\n\n### Context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Your environment\n\n<details>\n  <summary><code>npx @mui/envinfo</code></summary>\n\n```\n System:\n    OS: macOS 15.4.1\n  Binaries:\n    Node: 20.18.1 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v20.18.1/bin/node\n    npm: 10.8.2 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v20.18.1/bin/npm\n    pnpm: 10.10.0 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v20.18.1/bin/pnpm\n  Browsers:\n    Chrome: 136.0.7103.93\n    Edge: 136.0.3240.64\n    Safari: 18.4\n  npmPackages:\n    @emotion/react: ^11.13.3 => 11.13.3 \n    @emotion/styled: ^11.11.0 => 11.11.0 \n    @mui/core-downloads-tracker:  5.16.14 \n    @mui/icons-material: ^5.16.4 => 5.16.4 \n    @mui/material: ^5.16.14 => 5.16.14 \n    @mui/private-theming:  5.16.14 \n    @mui/styled-engine:  5.16.14 \n    @mui/system:  5.16.14 \n    @mui/types:  7.2.16 \n    @mui/utils:  5.16.14 \n    @mui/x-charts:  7.23.0 \n    @mui/x-charts-pro: ^7.23.0 => 7.23.0 \n    @mui/x-charts-vendor:  7.20.0 \n    @mui/x-data-grid:  7.29.3 \n    @mui/x-data-grid-premium: ^7.29.3 => 7.29.3 \n    @mui/x-data-grid-pro:  7.29.3 \n    @mui/x-date-pickers: ^7.28.0 => 7.28.0 \n    @mui/x-internals:  7.21.0 \n    @mui/x-license: ^7.26.0 => 7.29.1 \n    @mui/x-tree-view: ^7.22.1 => 7.22.1 \n    @types/react: ^17.0.75 => 17.0.76 \n    react: ^18.2.0 => 18.2.0 \n    react-dom: ^18.2.0 => 18.2.0 \n    styled-components: ^5.3.9 => 5.3.9 \n    typescript: ^5.7.3 => 5.7.3 \n```\n</details>\n\n\n\n**Search keywords**: datagrid preprocessEditCellProps isCellEditable",

We need to add more to cover all the code in vllm-ascend, and there are several principles to follow:\n\n1. The overall file tree should be consistent with `vllm_ascend`\n2. The file name should be the original file name with a prefix `test_`\n3. Use `unittest` framework, make good use of mock\n4. The UTs are all running on cpu node, mock the function related to device to host\n\nPlease refer to the official doc on [contributing](https://vllm-ascend.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide/contribution/index.html) and [testing](https://vllm-ascend.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide/contribution/testing.html) to develop, thanks!\n### Unit tests need to add\n\n- [ ] |-- test__version.py\n- [x] |-- test_ascend_config.py\n- [ ] |-- test_attention\n- [ ] |   |-- test_attention.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_attention_v1.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_mla_v1.py\n- [ ] |-- compilation\n- [ ] |   `-- test_piecewise_backend.py\n- [ ] |-- core\n- [ ] |   |-- test_schedule_config.py @nuclearwu\n- [ ] |   `-- test_scheduler.py\n- [ ] |-- device_allocator\n- [ ] |   `-- test_camem.py\n- [ ] |-- distributed\n- [ ] |   |-- test_communicator.py @FieeFlip\n- [ ] |   |-- test_device_communicators\n- [ ] |   |   |-- test_pyhccl.py\n- [ ] |   |   `-- test_pyhccl_wrapper.py\n- [x] |   |-- kv_transfer @Agonixiaoxiao \n- [x] |   |   |-- test_simple_buffer.py https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1531\n- [x] |   |   |-- test_simple_connector.py https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1531\n- [x] |   |   |-- test_simple_pipe.py https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1531\n- [ ] |   |   `-- test_utils.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_llmdatadist_connector.py\n- [x] |   `-- test_parallel_state.py   @wangyanhui-cmss https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1460\n- [ ] |-- test_envs.py\n- [ ] |-- lora\n- [ ] |   `-- punica_wrapper @hongfugui\n- [ ] |       `-- test_punica_npu.py @hongfugui\n- [ ] |-- models\n- [ ] |   |-- test_deepseek_dbo.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_deepseek_mtp.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_deepseek_v2.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_qwen2_5_vl.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_qwen2_5_vl_without_padding.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_qwen2_vl.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_qwen3_moe.py\n- [ ] |-- multistream\n- [ ] |   |-- test_base.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_context.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_decorator.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_layers.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_metadata.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_ms_split.py\n- [ ] |-- ops\n- [ ] |   |-- test_activation.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_attention.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_cache.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_common_fused_moe.py\n- [x] |   |-- test_expert_load_balancer.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_fused_moe.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_layernorm.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_rotary_embedding.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_vocab_parallel_embedding.py\n- [ ] |-- patch\n- [ ] |   |-- platform\n- [ ] |   |   |-- patch_0_9_1\n- [ ] |   |   |-- patch_common\n- [ ] |   |   |   `-- test_test_patch_distributed.py\n- [ ] |   |   `-- patch_main\n- [ ] |   `-- worker\n- [ ] |       |-- patch_0_9_1\n- [ ] |       |-- patch_common\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_distributed.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_eagle.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_minicpm.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_multi_step_worker.py\n- [x] |       |   |-- test_patch_sampler.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_spec_decode_worker.py\n- [ ] |       |   `-- test_patch_utils.py\n- [ ] |       `-- patch_main\n- [x] |-- test_platform.py @zhanghw0354 https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1476\n- [ ] |-- quantization\n- [ ] |   |-- test_func_wrapper.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_quant_config.py @nuclearwu\n- [ ] |   |-- test_quantizer.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_w8a8.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_w8a8_dynamic.py\n- [ ] |-- sample\n- [ ] |   |-- ops\n- [ ] |   `-- test_rejection_sampler.py\n- [x] |-- test_utils.py\n- [ ] `-- worker \n- [ ] |-- test_cache_engine.py @machenglong2025\n- [ ] |-- test_draft_model_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_model_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_model_runner_v1.py\n- [ ]  |-- test_mtp_proposer_v1.py @machenglong2025\n- [ ] |-- test_multi_step_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_multi_step_worker.py\n- [ ] |-- test_pooling_model_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_worker.py @zhanghw0354\n- [ ] `-- test_worker_v1.py @zhanghw0354\n",

The Mermaid code blocks are displayed as raw text instead of rendered diagrams.\n\n- The images in the page [quick_start](https://hugegraph.apache.org/docs/quickstart/hugegraph-ai/quick_start) can't be randering properly.\n\n**Specific Issues**:\n\n- 3 mermaid flowcharts in [quick_start.md](https://github.com/apache/incubator-hugegraph-doc/blob/master/content/en/docs/quickstart/hugegraph-ai/quick_start.md) cannot be rendered properly\n\n- Project architecture diagram in [main doc](https://github.com/apache/incubator-hugegraph-doc/blob/master/content/en/docs/quickstart/hugegraph-ai/_index.md) also cannot be displayed\n\n- Users can only see raw mermaid code, unable to understand project workflows and architecture\n\n- Users can not see actually image which should be randered in [documentation](https://hugegraph.apache.org/docs/quickstart/hugegraph-ai/quick_start/)\n",

I'm [Dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot) and I’m helping the incubator-hugegraph-doc team.\n\n<!-- Answer -->\nTo enable Mermaid diagram rendering in the HugeGraph documentation, add the following to your `config.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[params.mermaid]\nenable = true\n\n[markup]\n  [markup.highlight]\n    guessSyntax = false\n```\n\nThis activates the built-in Docsy/Hugo support for Mermaid diagrams, so code blocks with `mermaid` will render as diagrams instead of raw text. The site already includes the necessary scripts and logic to load and initialize Mermaid.js when this config is present [source](https://github.com/apache/incubator-hugegraph-doc/blob/48ff6f261c634e8d8ae9c4fac9e21524f67424b5/themes/docsy/layouts/partials/scripts.html).\n\nFor image issues: make sure all images referenced in documentation are stored locally (for example, in the `static/` directory) rather than using remote URLs, which can break or be blocked [source](https://github.com/apache/incubator-hugegraph-doc/blob/48ff6f261c634e8d8ae9c4fac9e21524f67424b5/config.toml). Hosting all third-party resources (like Mermaid.js, images, fonts) locally also helps avoid CSP and privacy policy issues [source](https://github.com/apache/incubator-hugegraph-doc/issues/388).\n\nAfter updating the configuration and image locations, rebuild the site and the diagrams/images should render as expected.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

The theme logic in this repo only loads Mermaid scripts if `.Site.Params.mermaid.enable` is set, so the specific `var params = null` TypeError cannot occur here. Your Mermaid diagrams are not rendering because the required config is missing, not due to the upstream bug.\n\nTo fix Mermaid rendering, add this to your `config.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[params.mermaid]\nenable = true\n\n[markup]\n  [markup.highlight]\n    guessSyntax = false\n```\n\nThis will enable Mermaid support and ensure diagrams render as expected.

This leads to **multiple duplicate network requests** or expensive calculations, significantly degrading performance.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n\n1. Use a `SelectField` that fetches options dynamically (e.g., via API call or computed function).\n2. Render a list or table with multiple rows using that field.\n3. Observe that options are re-fetched for every row, even if identical.\n\n**Expected behavior:**\n\n* Options should be **cached or shared across rows**, not reloaded individually.\n* Ideally, implement **memoization or global fetch per field config** instead of per row.\n\n**Suggested solution:**\n\n* Add option-level caching using key/field identity.\n* Allow developers to explicitly mark dynamic options as reusable across multiple items.\n* Optimize rendering for cases with common or slow-to-fetch options.\n\n**Impact:**\n\n* High on performance and UX in large lists.\n* Causes unnecessary load on backend if fetching from API.",

I guess in theory if we're really careful about the lookup logic (and the KVStore is async) we could do the loading in parallel (though its still a few more requests) but we'd still have to wait on compaction (without a background-compaction task running, which would require a generic `spawn` method...). Seems much easier to just check the length and skip some code for the common case :)", "If I understand it correctly, this is special casing for channels at the beginning of their life and when they grow, the node will switch over to persisting updates and compaction anyway?\n\nTo me it isn't quite clear if this is really worth it. If the hit is significant, it is also a problem when the channel has outgrown the 'small' stage anyway?", "> If I understand it correctly, this is special casing for channels at the beginning of their life and when they grow, the node will switch over to persisting updates and compaction anyway?\n\nYes.\n\n> To me it isn't quite clear if this is really worth it. If the hit is significant, it is also a problem when the channel has outgrown the 'small' stage anyway?\n\nIts more a recognition of two very different cases - if you're running an \"edge node\" that is just a wallet making occasional payments, then you're likely to never hit the \"large\" stage, and thus avoiding the compaction overhead is a really nice optimization. If you're a larger node that is forwarding/processing many payments, you're very likely to hit the \"large\" stage and the compaction penalty is worth it to avoid the writes.", "At what size would the \"large\" stage be entered then typically and how many htlcs/channel updates is that? A channel monitor of a few kb, that doesn't sound like all that many updates?", "Yea, dunno, we'd have to figure that out. I imagine most mobile nodes probably make in the 100s to low 1000s of payments in their entire lifetime, probably fewer on a single channel once you consider splicing and the like. 10KiB or whatever should be plenty for 100 or 250 payments.", "> Its more a recognition of two very different cases\n\nIt sounds like if you wanted to make this automatic, the metric you'd really want to evaluate to switch this behavior isn't so much monitor size, as one of these:\n\n  - Frequency of updates to the channel\n  - Latency of updates to the channel (more difficult)\n\nThe monitor size is a decent reflection of the _number_ of updates to the channel[1], but with no perception of time it's impossible to evaluate whether it's being stored by a tenured edge node, or a routing node. I think if you took time into account, perhaps by using the block delta between the funding tx and chain tip to estimate update frequency, you could make a more informed assessment.\n\nHowever, I worry that automating the behavior selection is not really following the \"principle of least astonishment.\" \n\nI would think that routing nodes rarely move to the edge, and edge nodes rarely become routing nodes (more often, a routing node starts small and may appear like an edge). And furthermore, I know what my node is likely to be; especially if I'm a Lightning developer and managing this on behalf of users, such as in a mobile wallet.\n\nFor that matter, varying the behavior _per channel_ seems to make node persistence more difficult to reason about. Different channels could persist different ways on my node, depending on a size threshold. Which means they can change without me doing anything. I would think that if the reason for variation is the use case, then one behavior is correct for all channels stored by the node.\n\nIn that light, I'd just leave this a configurable behavior, which I think it is now.\n\n[1] I recognize that size is being used here to evaluate the storage write size, not the number of updates. But I think that is why the discussion is unclear. Compared to update count/frequency, it's much harder to know the storage configuration of a given node, and what the throughput/latency tradeoff is like.", "I think the intent of the proposed change is to optimize for the edge-node case with remote storage. Even an edge node may make enough payments to get a monitor up to 10s of KiB in size, at which point network-level effects like TCP slowstart may dominate the actual network latency. For a \"power-user\" edge node, we really want to use the `MonitorUpdatingPersister`, but paying the extra RTT cost of cleanup on load for every edge node is not a great tradeoff either.\n\nFor a routing node, it still seems to me like a size-based threshold may be something they want, purely as it (very marginally) reduces IO throughput for under-utilized or new channels. Writing out updates (padded to 4KiB or more depending on the storage medium) and then consolidating when the whole monitor is only a few KiB isn't really the right tradeoff no matter what. Of course a routing node is expected to surpass the threshold very quickly, so it shouldn't really make a substantial difference, but it seems strictly better to write out full updates in this case than not.\n\nIndeed, this does lead to a bit of behavior shift, but I think the important metrics wouldn't change - first of all, if you happened to look at storage right after compaction, the stored contents would be identical to a full monitor persistence so I wouldn't really say that this materially changes the way that logic would interact with the stored data (you already have to handle the case of having no in-flight updates!). It also shouldn't materially change the IO throughput or write count for any node, just a fairly marginal strict reduction for routing nodes with fresh channels.", "> At what size would the \"large\" stage be entered then typically and how many htlcs/channel updates is that? A channel monitor of a few kb, that doesn't sound like all that many updates?\n\nFor our probing node running ldk-node with network storage (EFS), at around 20,000 updates over the single channel the average probe duration starts to increase substantially. p75 starts to creep up after about 3,000.", "Do y'all have any further thoughts here, @domZippilli or @amackillop?", "> Do y'all have any further thoughts here, [@domZippilli](https://github.com/domZippilli) or [@amackillop](https://github.com/amackillop)?\n\nI see in the PR it's configurable. I think as long as that's the case, developers who don't want the variation in behavior can set the minimum size to `0`.\n\neta: Also, I'm still not sure I like that it varies across channels, rather than a consistent behavior on a node.", "Perhaps wait for developers who do want/need the variation in behavior to show up and only then implement? I think the \"principle of least astonishment\" is worth considering.", "> Perhaps wait for developers who do want/need the variation in behavior to show up and only then implement? I think the \"principle of least astonishment\" is worth considering.\n\nWell, we likely do want to enable MUP in LDK Node, especially when persisting vs. remote storage/VSS. The question is whether it's preferable to *always* use MUP, even for very small monitors. I'd be reluctant to expose a setting in LDK Node for this, as I don't think our users would have better insight into which way to go than we do.", "> Perhaps wait for developers who do want/need the variation in behavior to show up and only then implement? I think the \"principle of least astonishment\" is worth considering.\n\nFWIW I think the \"principle of least astonishment\" is served perfectly fine by changing the MUP to persist full monitors when they're small - there's no material difference in user-visible behavior between persisting full monitors and small ones, except the performance changes (i.e. we definitely can't persist full monitors that are huge). When persisting small monitors, its no difference from hitting the cleanup ID where we delete the updates anyway. Because of this I still think this change is *strictly better* than the current version.", ">there's no material difference in user-visible behavior between persisting full monitors and small ones\n\nThat's clear. I was thinking of least astonishment in reasoning about and resolving potential problems. Basically what @domZippilli mentions in https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/3770#issuecomment-2984271612.\n\nIn this case, I would define 'strictly better' as a performance increase without an increase in complexity." ],

When the API key is empty, the header becomes `Authorization: Basic ` or `Authorization: Bearer `, which is considered an illegal header value by the HTTP library and causes the execution to fail ([source](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/blob/bb955806e042517831b232948c3f9f7150ac5fb6/api/core/workflow/nodes/http_request/executor.py)). The code only checks that the API key field exists, not that it contains a non-empty value.\n\nAs a workaround, avoid configuring HTTPRequest nodes with empty API keys for these auth types. If your workflow might have an empty key, consider adding logic to skip the HTTPRequest node or switch to \"no-auth\" when the key is empty. There’s currently no built-in validation or warning for this in Dify, so it’s a systemic issue, not a new regression.\n\nNo official documentation or existing issues address this yet.

Open root tree item\n2. Wait 3 seconds for nested tree item to be removed\n3. Root tree item still shows expanded icon\n\n### \uD83D\uDCF8 Screenshots or code \nExample can be found in Stackblitz above.\n\n### \uD83D\uDDA5 \uD83D\uDCF1 Device \n- Type: Desktop\n- Device: Windows laptop\n- OS version: Windows 10 \n- Browser version: Edge \n\n### \uD83E\uDDD0 Expected behaviour \nThe expanded icon should disappear if there are no nested items\n\n### \uD83D\uDCDD Acceptance Criteria  \nIf relevant, describe in full detail the different interactions and edge cases that the component or patterns needs to fulfil. \n\n*Given that the root item contains nested items* \n*When the nested items are removed*  \n*Then the expanded icon should disappear*\n\n*Given that the root items contains nested items*\n*When the nested items are removed*\n*Then `onIcTreeItemExpanded` should no longer be emitted on click \n\n### \uD83D\uDEA8 Urgency (low, medium or high)\nHigh (due to not having a workaround)\n\n<!--\n- Low = Does not have significant impact and can be addressed at a convenient time without causing delays.\n- Medium = Has moderate impact and should be addressed soon to avoid potential delays or complications.\n- High = A critical issue which has significant impact and needs immediate attention to prevent major delays or blockers.\n-->\n\n### Additional info \nN/A",

      "description" : "### Apache Airflow version\n\n3.0.2\n\n### If \"Other Airflow 2 version\" selected, which one?\n\n_No response_\n\n### What happened?\n\nI opened the Trigger Dag form in the Airflow 3 UI and filled in parameters under the section “Run Parameters” (or under “Advanced Options → Configuration JSON”). \n\nWhen I submit the form to backfill a historical date range, the DAG run is created and executes, but the parameters I entered are not actually passed into the tasks. Inside the task, references like {{ params.my_param }} or accessing context[\"params\"][\"my_param\"] remain unset. \n\nAlthough the UI shows the parameters form, these values never make it into the task context. \n\n### What you think should happen instead?\n\nWhen I trigger a backfill from the Airflow 3 UI and enter parameters in the Run Parameters or Advanced Options → Configuration JSON, these values should be passed to each DAG run created during the backfill.\n\nInside the DAG, I should be able to access them using:\n\t•\t{{ params.my_param }} in templates\n\t•\tcontext[\"params\"][\"my_param\"] in Python code\n\nThis is how it works when triggering a single DAG run from the UI, so the behavior should be the same for backfills. The parameters entered in the UI should override the defaults defined in the DAG and be available in all backfilled runs.\n\n### How to reproduce\n\n1.\tCreate the following DAG:\n\n```\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom airflow.decorators import dag, task\nfrom airflow.models.param import Param, ParamsDict\n\n@task\ndef test_backfill_with_params(params: ParamsDict):\n    assert params.get(\"id\") is not None\n\n@dag(\n    dag_id='test_backfill',\n    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),\n    schedule='@daily',\n    catchup=False,\n    default_args={'owner': 'Gery', 'retries': 0},\n    params={\n        \"id\": Param(default=None, title=\"My id\", description=\"My id\", type=[\"null\", \"string\"]),\n    }\n)\ndef test_backfill_dag():\n    test_backfill_with_params()\n\ntest_backfill_dag()\n```\n\n2.\tGo to the Airflow 3 UI.\n3.\tOpen the Backfill modal for the test_backfill DAG.\n4.\tSet a date range (e.g., start and end: 2025-06-01 00:00 and 2025-06-02 00:00).\n5.\tIn the Run Parameters section, set id = \"1234\".\n6.\tTrigger the backfill.\n\nExpected: The DAG run(s) should pass \"id\": \"1234\" to the task, and the assertion should pass.\nActual: The parameter is not passed, and the task fails due to params.get(\"id\") being None.\n\n### Operating System\n\nMac OS 14.6 (23G80)\n\n### Versions of Apache Airflow Providers\n\nNo providers\n\n### Deployment\n\nDocker-Compose\n\n### Deployment details\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Are you willing to submit PR?\n\n- [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n",

This `else` will never be used, as inside this Block `isOnline() && !isOfflineMode()` is true.\n\n@hohwille  Should this method be refactored?" ],

It's not an issue of implementation, it's a bug in nodetool syntax that makes this case ambiguous and nodetool has no idea what the user intended.\r\n\r\n> Since the key is passed over an http-based interface I suggest to allow encoding `:` characters using the standard http encoding as `%3A` substrings (`seastar::http::internal::url_decode` can be used to decode such strings).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if that was your intention, but such encoding (which obviously has to happen when building the REST API URL), will not help to differentiate whether \"a:b\" is two components or one with a colon. Also, if the nodetool API is already ambgious (what does the \"a:b\" the user passed mean?) there is no way that additional encoding can fix it.\r\n\r\nIf you change anything in this area, please don't forget to add tests.", "From the api standpoint what I had in mind is to pass `key=a%3Ab` if the non-composite key (or one of its components) contains `:`.\r\nThe user can pass that to nodetool as well.\r\n\r\nThat said, allowing passing multiple components as request parameters is possible too, though with the current interface it is not intuitive to assume that the multiple key parameters indicate multiple components of a composite key rather than multiple keys, if the API supported returning the natural endpoints for multiple keys.\r\n\r\nNote that `%3A` is supported for `keyspace:table` \"tuples\" when passed as a single parameter or as a comma-separated list of `keyspace:table`, to support keyspace or table names containing `:`.", "> From the api standpoint what I had in mind is to pass `key=a%3Ab` if the non-composite key (or one of its components) contains `:`. The user can pass that to nodetool as well.\r\n\r\n`key=a%3Ab` is the url-encoded form of setting key to `a:b`. But now that Scylla receives it, how does it know if this was intended to be a string key `a:b` or two components?\r\n\r\nMaybe you were thinking of encoding **twice**?

Some ideas raised in this issue required even more explicit changes to nodetool that would need to be tested.\n\nPlease also see my recommendation in https://github.com/scylladb/scylladb/pull/24720 to improve the commit message to say exactly what we're fixing and what we aren't, and also consider which documentation we need to update to explain the situation with the colon.\n\n> \n> [@denesb](https://github.com/denesb) should review\n\n" ],

Here's my approach:\r\n\r\n      def astro_support:\r\n          class AstroSupport:\r\n              def __init__(self):\r\n                  # Call both quantity and time support functions and assign them to a class variable, e.g., self.q_support\r\n                 \r\n              def __enter__(self):\r\n                  # Enter both quantity and time support context\r\n                  \r\n              def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):\r\n                  # Exit both quantity and time support context\r\n               \r\n          return AstroSupport()  # Return an instance so the function can be used without managing the context manually\r\nI would need to look into other parameters passed to quantity_support and time_support, but otherwise, this approach should work.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you think this is a good direction or if there are any additional considerations or improvements I should be aware of.\r\n\r\nP.S. I am a beginner, so please excuse any mistakes or oversights!\r\n\r\n\r\n", "@spranav1205 Hi, thanks for looking into this !\r\n\r\nNowadays Python's standard lib is richer and I think we can go with a simpler desgin that the one that was choosen at the time for `time_support` and `quantity_support`.\r\nIn particular, for this specific task of combining existing context managers, I think we should use (or take inspiration from) [`contextlib.ExitStack`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.ExitStack).", "We can use the following approach to combine `quantity_support` and `time_support` using a function, without the need for a class:\r\n\r\n    @contextmanager\r\n    def astro_support():\r\n     \r\n        q = quantity_support()\r\n        t = time_support()\r\n        \r\n        try:\r\n            q.__enter__()\r\n            t.__enter__()\r\n            yield  \r\n        finally:\r\n            q.__exit__()\r\n            t.__exit__()\r\n\r\nWith this implementation, astro_support can be used as a context manager with the `with` statement, but it can't be used independently like` quantity_support()` or `time_support()`.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we can implement `astro_support` as a class, which can act both as a context manager (with `with`) and as a decorator for functions. This would look something like:\r\n\r\n    class astro_support(ContextDecorator):\r\n              def __init__(self):\r\n                  # Call both quantity and time support functions and assign them to a class variable, e.g., self.q_support\r\n                 \r\n              def __enter__(self):\r\n                  # Enter both quantity and time support context\r\n                  \r\n              def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):\r\n                  # Exit both quantity and time support context\r\n                  \r\nWould you like me to implement either of these? Or should we explore some other method?\r\n", "Actually the `contextlib.contexmanager` implementation also allows using it as a decorator\r\n\r\nquoting from https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.contextmanager\r\n> [contextmanager()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.contextmanager) uses [ContextDecorator](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.ContextDecorator) so the context managers it creates can be used as decorators as well as in [with](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#with) statements. When used as a decorator, a new generator instance is implicitly created on each function call (this allows the otherwise “one-shot” context managers created by [contextmanager()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.contextmanager) to meet the requirement that context managers support multiple invocations in order to be used as decorators).\r\n\r\nSo my preference is to go with the first approach as it's simpler. Note that it is generally not recommended to call so-called dunder[^1] methods like `__enter__` and `__exit__` directly, so I would favor something like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom contextlib import contextmanager, ExitStack\r\n\r\n@contextmanager\r\ndef astro_support():\r\n    with ExitStack() as stack:\r\n        stack.enter_context(quantity_support())\r\n        stack.enter_context(time_support())\r\n        yield\r\n```\r\n\r\n[^1]: \"dunder\" is short for \"double underscore\" and is a common way to refer to Python's protocols that are named with two leading and two trailing underscores", "Yes, this works perfectly. I have opened a PR #17575. I will update the changelog and add a test case shortly!", "Hi @astropy/core team \uD83D\uDC4B\nI'd love to help close out issue #8860 (“enable both quantity_support and time_support in one go”). I saw PR #17979 is already addressing this great start!\nI can help with:\n\nAdding unit tests (both context manager and decorator use cases)\nUpdating the visualization documentation\nWould it be helpful if I take this on next?" ],

Within this PR, the change regarding `queue` was [noted](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/pull/7088#issuecomment-480358802), but no further decisions were made.\r\n\r\n## To Reproduce\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI would expect the documentation to match the actual logic.\r\n\r\nAs I recently started using the Event Stream API a lot, I relied on the documented behavior, but, fortunately, did not ran in any errors - or at least non I know of. Thus, if the uniqueness constraint is not enforced anyway, maybe drop the whole parameter or change the code again to match the documented restrictions. As I myself do not know Icinga 2's internal well enough, I cannot say what would be best.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n## Your Environment\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nn/a",

      "comments" : [ "DataFlex uses a lot of different file extensions, some of which will likely have conflicts. Modern DataFlex uses a common workspace structure, such as `AppSrc/cMyClass.pkg`. Searching for [NOT is:fork path:Appsrc/**.pkg](https://github.com/search?type=code&q=NOT+is%3Afork+path%3AAppsrc%2F**.pkg\n) narrows it down to effectively DataFlex source code files and provides 900+ results. Many of the other file extensions are nowhere near that many, so it won't meet the minimum usage requirements.\n\nGiven that there are so many file extensions in use, maybe a better initial approach could be to add support for DataFlex without specifying `extensions` or `filenames` to avoid conflicts. And DataFlex source repositories can use `.gitattributes` overrides for the relevant extensions instead. Obviously not ideal, but it would at least provide recognition for the DataFlex language, and that's a great starting point.\n\nI see there is some precedence for languages without specifying file extensions, such as for Elvish transcripts from PR #6302, which is mainly used inside markdown files. @lildude and @NilsSve, I can help and put up a PR for adding the DataFlex language without specifying any file extensions, would that work?\n", "Hi Sonny,\n\nIf you are asking me, yes, that would help!

The Elvish exception is because there isn't a common extension as it's predominantly used in a markdown files. This is not the case with DataFlex.\n\nI know nothing about DataFlex but wikipedia says \"DataFlex is an object-oriented high-level programming language and a fourth generation visual tool for developing Windows, web and mobile software applications on one framework-based platform.\"\n\nWe do not add support for frameworks, hence we support Ruby, but not Rails, so the right thing to do is concentrate on only the language files. I'd expect the language to have a common extension and structure that can be identified.  This should be what is added first, assuming usage meets requirements, and then users can use the overrides to classify the other extensions if they want.\n\nIf the language predominantly uses a generic extension like `.pkg` (poor design decision IMO), this can be added the `generic.yml` file and a heuristic will be used to identify the language, but be warned: this heuristic _must_ be very accurate to only identify DataFlex files and must be linear and performant. It's better for this regex to under identify DataFlex files than misidentify other languages." ],

      "description" : "## Problem\n\nCurrently, epsilon values are hardcoded throughout the HLSL shader codebase with various precision levels (1e-4, 1e-5, 1e-6, 1e-8, 1e-10), making maintenance difficult and potentially introducing inconsistencies within similar mathematical contexts.\n\n## Analysis\n\n### Current Epsilon Distribution:\n- **1e-6f**: 7 occurrences (6 in BRDF visibility functions + 1 in Diffuse_OrenNayar)\n- **1e-5**: 12+ occurrences (most common - PBR dot products, thresholds)\n- **1e-4**: 8 occurrences (lighting radius/distance checks, geometric tests)\n- **1e-8**: 2 occurrences (specialized - glints ellipse ratios)\n- **1e-10**: 4 occurrences (spherical harmonics weight normalization)\n\n### Mathematical Contexts Identified:\n\n#### 1. Division Protection (Current: 1e-6f)\nUsed in BRDF visibility functions to prevent division by zero:\n```hlsl\nreturn rcp(max(Vis_SmithV * Vis_SmithL, 1e-6f));\n```\n**Files:** package/Shaders/Common/BRDF.hlsli\n\n#### 2. Dot Product Clamping (Current: 1e-5)\nEnsures lighting terms don't go to zero:\n```hlsl\nfloat NdotL = clamp(dot(N, L), 1e-5, 1);\nfloat NdotV = saturate(abs(dot(N, V)) + 1e-5);\n```\n**Files:** package/Shaders/Common/PBR.hlsli, various feature shaders\n\n#### 3. Distance/Radius Thresholds (Current: 1e-4)\nUsed for geometric and lighting distance checks:\n```hlsl\nfloat distance = max(length(lightVector), 1e-4);\n```\n**Files:** Various lighting feature shaders\n\n#### 4. Specialized Precision (Current: 1e-8, 1e-10)\n- **1e-8**: Glints ellipse ratio calculations\n- **1e-10**: Spherical harmonics weight normalization\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nAdd domain-specific epsilon constants to Math.hlsli using #define to match current HLSL constant practices:\n\n```hlsl\n// Domain-specific epsilon values for numerical stability\n#define EPSILON_DIVISION    1e-6f    // For rcp() division protection\n#define EPSILON_DOT_CLAMP   1e-5f    // For NdotL/NdotV clamping\n#define EPSILON_DISTANCE    1e-4f    // For distance/radius thresholds\n#define EPSILON_GLINTS      1e-8f    // For glints calculations\n#define EPSILON_WEIGHT_SUM  1e-10f   // For weight normalization\n```\n\n## Files Requiring Updates\n\nBased on analysis, the following files contain hardcoded epsilon values that should be replaced:\n\n- package/Shaders/Common/BRDF.hlsli (1e-6f → EPSILON_DIVISION)\n- package/Shaders/Common/PBR.hlsli (1e-5 → EPSILON_DOT_CLAMP)\n- features/DynamicCubemaps/Shaders/DynamicCubemaps/DynamicCubemaps.hlsli (0.00001 → EPSILON_DOT_CLAMP)\n- features/Skylighting/Shaders/Skylighting/Skylighting.hlsli (1e-10 → EPSILON_WEIGHT_SUM)\n- features/ScreenSpaceGI/Shaders/ScreenSpaceGI/ScreenSpaceGI.hlsli (1e-4 → EPSILON_DISTANCE)\n- features/TerrainBlending/Shaders/TerrainBlending/TerrainBlending.hlsli (1e-4 → EPSILON_DISTANCE)\n- Various other feature shader files\n\n## Benefits\n\n1. **Consistency**: Same epsilon values used for identical mathematical purposes\n2. **Maintainability**: Single location to adjust epsilon values if needed\n3. **Documentation**: Clear intent through descriptive constant names\n4. **Standards Compliance**: Uses #define convention matching existing HLSL constants\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n- Different epsilon values serve mathematically distinct purposes with different sensitivity requirements\n- Performance impact is zero - different epsilon values have no measurable performance cost on modern GPUs\n- Domain-specific precision is necessary to avoid either visible artifacts or unnecessary precision loss\n\n## Related\n\n- PR #1226: Added NaN prevention checks to BRDF visibility functions using 1e-6f values\n- Discussion in PR #1226 comment thread about epsilon standardization\n\nBacklinks:\n- PR: https://github.com/doodlum/skyrim-community-shaders/pull/1226\n- Comment: https://github.com/doodlum/skyrim-community-shaders/pull/1226#issuecomment-discussion",

After a detailed investigation, Here is a little suggestion maybe can help.\nThe root cause is not in the MCP JAM Inspector app’s frontend or proxy, but rather in how the backend of your mcp tool server generates the JSON schema for parameters defined as `Annotated[Optional[str], Field(...)] = None`.\n\n### What’s Happening\n\n- The backend generates a schema for `Optional[str]` using `Annotated` that looks like:\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"name\": {\n        \"anyOf\": [{ \"type\": \"string\" }, { \"type\": \"null\" }],\n        \"default\": null,\n        \"description\": \"Your name\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n- The frontend UI interprets this as a complex type, resulting in the parameter being wrapped as `{ \"name\": { \"name\": \"test string\" } }` instead of `{ \"name\": \"test string\" }`.\n- This causes Pydantic validation errors and prevents tools using this pattern from being testable via the MCP JAM interface.\n\n### Why This Isn’t a Frontend Bug\n\n- The frontend simply renders forms and serializes parameters based on the schema it receives from the backend.\n- The proxy does not modify the request payloads.\n- The issue is with the schema generation, not with how the UI sends or the proxy forwards the data.\n\n### How to Fix or Work Around\n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  Define your parameter as `name: str | None = Field(default=None, description=\"...\")` (or, for older Python, `Optional[str] = Field(default=None, description=\"...\")`).\n- This produces a simpler schema (`type: [\"string\", \"null\"]`) that the UI will treat as a plain string (or null), and will serialize as `{ \"name\": \"test string\" }`.\n- If you must use `Annotated`, ensure your backend (Pydantic/FastAPI) is up to date, as newer versions may handle this more gracefully.\n\n---\n\nI'd be glad in hear your comments about this suggestion and also I could check that you solved this with a similar option that is removing the optional and use str with a default value that works too. If you think that this solve your issue please let me know for close it." ],

And don't hesitate to open a (draft) pull request early on to show the direction it is heading towards. This way, you will receive valuable feedback.\n\nHappy coding! \uD83D\uDE80", "@Munhangyeol May I ask you about your timeline? This is kind of important as our tests are not green any more :)", "@Munhangyeol When working on this, please update the sub modules and fix the mentioned tests.

I quote from the community chat:\n\nDue to some experiments with the gradle build, one needs to do some extra step to keep the build running\n\n    cd build-logic\n    git clone https://github.com/koppor/java-module-packaging.git\n\nWe think, this won't be necessary in about one week - but whoever works on JabRef now and updates main should be aware", "> [@koppor](https://github.com/koppor) I'm currently working on something else, but I think I can take care of it later this week. Would that be too late? \uD83D\uDE25\n\nIt's very OK as we fixed `main` by reverting the breaking change. If you base on main, you need to \n\n    git revert d0717a09f5c3b7da80cfb28ac702121c5afa8d3c\n\nand then start coding :)" ],

It natively supports MCP via `MCPTool` and can interoperate with both `mcpgateway-wrapper` and SSE/HTTP transports.\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDCCD Location of the Problem\n\n> Suggested location: `docs/docs/using/agents/beeai.md`  \n> Also update: `.pages` in `docs/docs/using/agents/` to include `beeai.md`\n\nPage: https://ibm.github.io/mcp-context-forge/using/agents/bee/\n---\n\n### ✏️ Type of Issue\n\n* [x] Missing client documentation\n* [x] New integration support\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDCA1 Suggested Fix or Clarification\n\nFollow the style used in `claude-desktop.md` and other client entries. Include:\n\n- Brief overview of BeeAI Framework\n- MCP integration via `MCPTool`\n- Sample usage with `mcpgateway-wrapper`\n- Optional section for SSE/WebSocket (if BeeAI supports it)\n- Tips for configuring tool discovery\n- Links to BeeAI official documentation\n\nInclude both stdio and REST variants for completeness.\n\n---\n\n### \uD83E\uDDE9 Additional Notes\n\nBeeAI supports observability, custom memory layers, and multi-LLM routing-consider noting how Gateway features like caching or SSE streams complement those workflows.\n",

      "description" : "# Migrate remaining CLI input methods to use @clack/prompts for consistency\n\n## \uD83C\uDFAF Summary\n\nCurrently, the CLI uses a mix of input libraries (`inquirer`, Bun's global `prompt()`, and `@clack/prompts`). We should standardize on `@clack/prompts` for a consistent user experience and better styling across all CLI interactions.\n\n## \uD83D\uDCCB Current State\n\nMost of the CLI already uses `@clack/prompts` properly, but there are **2 main files** still using other input methods:\n\n### 1. `src/utils/plugin-creator.ts` - Using `inquirer` \uD83D\uDCE6\n\nThis file has multiple `inquirer.prompt()` calls that need to be migrated:\n\n- **Plugin specification collection** (~line 172-290):\n  - Plugin name input\n  - Plugin description input  \n  - Plugin features input\n  - Component selection (checkbox)\n  - Action names input\n  - Provider names input\n  - Evaluator names input\n  - Service names input\n\n### 2. `scripts/generate-unit-tests.ts` - Using global `prompt()` \uD83D\uDD27\n\n- **Test generation confirmation** (~line 165):\n  ```typescript\n  const answer = prompt('Generate tests? (y/n): ');\n  ```\n\n## ✨ Benefits of Migration\n\n1. **Consistent UX** - All CLI interactions will have the same look and feel\n2. **Better styling** - Clack provides superior visual design and animations\n3. **Better error handling** - Clack has built-in cancellation handling\n4. **Reduced dependencies** - Can remove `inquirer` from package.json\n5. **Type safety** - Better TypeScript integration\n\n## \uD83D\uDD27 Implementation Examples\n\n### For `plugin-creator.ts`:\n\n**Before (inquirer):**\n```typescript\nconst answers = await inquirer.prompt([\n  {\n    type: 'input',\n    name: 'name',\n    message: 'Plugin name (without \"plugin-\" prefix):',\n    validate: (input: string) => input.length > 0 || 'Plugin name is required'\n  }\n]);\n```\n\n**After (clack):**\n```typescript\nconst name = await clack.text({\n  message: 'Plugin name (without \"plugin-\" prefix):',\n  validate: (input) => input.length > 0 ? undefined : 'Plugin name is required'\n});\n\nif (clack.isCancel(name)) {\n  clack.cancel('Operation cancelled.');\n  process.exit(0);\n}\n```\n\n### For `generate-unit-tests.ts`:\n\n**Before:**\n```typescript\nconst answer = prompt('Generate tests? (y/n): ');\n```\n\n**After:**\n```typescript\nconst answer = await clack.confirm({\n  message: 'Generate tests?',\n  initialValue: true\n});\n\nif (clack.isCancel(answer)) {\n  console.log('Cancelled.');\n  return;\n}\n```\n\n## ✅ Reference Files (Already Using Clack)\n\nThese files are already properly implemented and serve as good examples:\n- `src/commands/create/actions/creators.ts`\n- `src/commands/create/index.ts`\n- `src/commands/env/actions/edit.ts`\n- `src/commands/publish/utils/validation.ts`\n- `src/utils/cli-prompts.ts`\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Replace all `inquirer.prompt()` calls in `plugin-creator.ts` with clack equivalents\n- [ ] Replace global `prompt()` call in `generate-unit-tests.ts` with clack\n- [ ] Remove `inquirer` dependency from `package.json` if no longer used elsewhere\n- [ ] Ensure all prompts handle cancellation properly (ctrl+c)\n- [ ] Test plugin creation flow works identically to current behavior\n- [ ] Test unit test generation script works identically to current behavior\n- [ ] Maintain existing validation logic and error messages\n- [ ] Update any related TypeScript types if needed\n\n## \uD83C\uDFAF Priority\n\n**Medium** - This improves developer experience and code consistency but doesn't affect core functionality.\n\n## \uD83D\uDCA1 Implementation Notes\n\n- The `generate-unit-tests.ts` part would be a good **beginner-friendly** task\n- The `plugin-creator.ts` part is more complex due to multiple sequential prompts\n- Consider breaking this into two separate PRs if needed\n- Make sure to test the checkbox selection for component types in plugin creation\n\n---\n\n**Note**: The majority of the CLI already uses clack properly - this is just cleaning up the last few stragglers to ensure complete consistency across the entire CLI experience.",

This is personal opinion however I believe snapshottest's approach of auto-creating the snapshots when missing is problematic. Imagine if you've written a number of new test cases and forget to create the relevant snapshots. If you push up your changes to your version control system and your CI system runs the test suite, with auto-create functionality, the tests will pass. This gives a false sense of confidence in the test suite. For all you know, the generated snapshot could be different every CI run.\r\n\r\nSyrupy's stance is that a missing snapshot is no different from a non-matching snapshot. Syrupy has no way of knowing that you've just written a new test case and so we expect a snapshot not to exist, vs. a test case has been renamed disconnecting it from the snapshot file, or the dev forgot to commit the snapshot artifacts to git when pushing up their branch for CI to run.", "why not use a CI option to throw on missing tests like jest does? ", "I'm open to that idea. I'd still want it to be opt-in though.", "I would also like to add a vote for this, a team member just added syrupy to one of our repos but previously we have just done this manually.\nIn those implementations, we always set it up so if the comparison file is missing, it generates it and then fails the test with an Error message stating it has created the file.\nThe next run would then pass.\n\nThis means that if it was missing due to not being committed or some other reason, it should still fail in CI. But yes makes it a lot easier to update the expectations from within an ide \uD83D\uDC4D \n\nOn that note, it would also be great if it is opt-in, if it was possible through a config file or env var. I think it would be possible to set the flag in the IDE but it would be nicer to not have to mess with pycharm settings to turn that behaviour on.\n\nThanks" ],

Having a way to specify that a file should NOT be opened at all and not added to the file groups would be very practical\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n - Distinguish between unsupported and invalid files\n - Add a `--skip-unsupported-files` CLI option and add it to the default config\n - Add a test opening a folder containing a file to skip with a config file to skip that file based on the extension\n\n**Additional context**\nWhile this may be a bit confusing, this will be very practical for interactive use of F3D and should be trivial to implement\n",

      "comments" : [ "Hey Seaders, thanks for your Issue!\n\n---\n\n### Recommendation\n\nMy recommendation is to keep your two declaration files separate. This approach makes your content declarations more maintainable and flexible, especially if you plan to use the visual editor.\n\n```ts\nimport { type DeclarationContent } from 'intlayer';\n\nconst overviewContent = {\n  key: 'overview',\n  content: {\n    header: 'Do all this awesome stuff with ',\n    subHeader: ['With ', \" you'll be even more awesome!\"],\n  },\n} satisfies DeclarationContent;\n\nexport default overviewContent;\n```\n\n```tsx\nimport { useIntlayer } from 'next-intlayer'; // or react-intlayer\nimport { type FC } from 'react';\n\nexport const YourComponent: FC = () => {\n  const { brandName, brandNameShort } = useIntlayer('app');\n  const { header, subHeader } = useIntlayer('overview');\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>\n        {header}\n        {brandName}\n      </h1>\n      <h2>\n        {subHeader[0]}\n        {brandNameShort}\n        {subHeader[1]}\n      </h2>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```\n\n### Alternative: Importing One Content File into Another\n\nIf you'd like to use TypeScript declaration files, an alternative is to import one content file into the other.\n\nHere’s an example:\n\n```ts\nimport { type DeclarationContent } from 'intlayer';\nimport appContent from './app.content';\n\nconst overviewContent = {\n  key: 'overview',\n  content: {\n    header: `Do all this awesome stuff with ${appContent.content.brandName}`,\n    subHeader: `With ${appContent.content.brandNameShort}, you'll be even more awesome!`,\n  },\n} satisfies DeclarationContent;\n\nexport default overviewContent;\n```\n\nIt will works properly, but the limitation of this approach is its compatibility with the visual editor for your `overviewContent` content declaration file. The editor will interpret `Do all this awesome stuff with Other Detail: Company Name` as a single string fully declared in your `overviewContent` declaration file. The visual editor does not interpret nested declaration for now.\n\n### Alternative: Using Component Logic\n\nAnother option is to call your content as a string using `.value` and replace placeholders with JavaScript's `replace` function.\n\n```tsx\nimport { useIntlayer } from 'next-intlayer'; // or react-intlayer\nimport { type FC } from 'react';\n\nexport const YourComponent: FC = () => {\n  const { brandName, brandNameShort } = useIntlayer('app');\n  const { header, subHeader } = useIntlayer('overview');\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>{header.value.replace('%%{app.brandName}%%', brandName.value)}</h1>\n      <h2>\n        {subHeader.value.replace(\n          '%%{app.brandNameShort}%%',\n          brandNameShort.value\n        )}\n      </h2>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nHowever, this approach sacrifices the benefits of the `IntlayerNode` (type returned by objects like `brandName`, `brandNameShort`, `header`, or `subHeader`). These types enable features such as displaying the content selector within the visual editor.\n\n### Content Nesting\n\nI know that **i18next** offers a similar feature called [`nesting`](https://www.i18next.com/translation-function/nesting). Would this be a feature you'd like to see in Intlayer? If so, and if there’s enough interest from others, let me know. I’d be happy to add it to the roadmap.\n\n---\n\n### Updated Visual Editor Documentation\n\nRegarding the visual editor: A new documentation has been released since Intlayer v4. The previous visual editor have been slitted into two tools :\n- [Intlayer visual editor (for locale declaration files)](https://intlayer.org/doc/concept/editor)\n- [Intlayer CMS (for distant dictionaries)](https://intlayer.org/doc/concept/cms)\n\nBecause of a big refactor regarding the approach, the visual editor will be released in the coming days with version 4.1.0. Meanwhile, we are still working on improvements related to the CMS, which will be fully available next weeks.", "I don't love option one because if `brandName` comes first in one language, we'd need to have an empty entry first, then `brandName`, then the second entry.  I think I'll probably go with option 2 until I get the visual editor working fully right at least, but i18n's nesting does look the most ideal solution (but also definitely the most complex one too, unfortunately).\n\nOne way or another, thanks so much for the comprehensive response, and, overall your work on this, it's massively appreciated.", "Hi @seaders !\n\nJust to communicate the release of [nesting](https://intlayer.org/doc/concept/content/nesting) feature sice the v5! \n\nI hope it will match your needs", "I FINALLY got around to this @aymericzip thanks so much for your work on this, it really is great and appreciated.\n\nI think? I'm using it correctly, but I did find one issue where I'm not sure if it's my incorrect usage.\n\nUsing this dictionary code,\n\n```\nimport { nest, type Dictionary } from \"intlayer\"\n\nconst brandNameShort = nest(\"app\", \"brandNameShort\")\n\nexport default {\n  key: \"overview\",\n  content: {\n    publishHeader: (\n      <>\n        Publish your product listings in the {brandNameShort} Mobile Web\n        Application or in the {brandNameShort} Chrome Extension\n      </>\n    ),\n    brandNameShort\n  }\n} satisfies Dictionary\n```\n\nand this view code,\n\n```\n  const { brandNameShort } = useIntlayer(\"app\")\n  const overview = useIntlayer(\"overview\")\n  console.log(\"overview\", overview)\n\n  return (\n      <h2>{brandNameShort}</h2>\n      <h2>{overview.brandNameShort}</h2>\n      <h2>{overview.publishHeader}</h2>\n  )\n```\n\nThe correct brand name is shown under \"brandNameShort\", coming from the app dictionary, \"overview.brandNameShort\", coming, nested, from the overview dictionary, but for \"overview.publishHeader\", I get\n\n> Publish your product listings in the Mobile Web Application or in the Chrome Extension\n\nAgain, not totally sure if this is by design or not, but I just thought I'd point it out to you.  Thanks again!", "Hey @seaders! Thanks for the feedback!\n\nMaybe have a look to the [insert function](https://intlayer.org/doc/concept/content/insertion)\n\nBut the combinaison of nesting + insertion + react node is not supported for now\n\nA way to fix it\n \n```ts\nimport { nest, insert, type Dictionary } from \"intlayer\"\n\nexport default {\n  key: \"overview\",\n  content: {\n    publishHeader: insert(\"Publish your product listings in the {{brandNameShort}} Mobile Web.

      "description" : "## The problem\r\n\r\n<!-- Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.\r\nA clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when -->\r\n\r\nWe have enabled [strict types](https://www.phptutorial.net/php-tutorial/php-strict_types/) already in https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/pull/1350, however this lead to issues like https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/issues/1435. It is an example of what can happen, if type casting goes wrong.\r\n\r\nNote generally, if we have strict types, we should also declare what types we use, just as other programming languages. A discussion of advantages of strict typing vs loose (or no) typing (at all, what PHP did before) goes beyond the scope of this issue, but in short:\r\n> Type hinting in method parameters or class properties is very useful and it helps you catch type errors before you run your code. \r\n\r\nhttps://dev.to/rocksheep/the-way-stricttypes-works-in-php-eb7\r\nMore here: https://dev.to/robdwaller/how-php-type-declarations-actually-work-1mm5\r\n\r\nAs [PHP nowadays supports type hints/type declarations](https://stackoverflow.com/a/29967975/5008962) as of PHP v7\r\n\r\n## The solution\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. Pitch your solution! What would happen, if we don't implement this? -->\r\n\r\n* [x] first of all, check, if strict types are enabled in all files (excluding dependencies of course)\r\n* [ ] step by step, convert the code [and add type declarations](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.declarations.php) to the functions, both for arguments as well as\r\n* [ ] test that everything still works as wanted, both via unit tests and manual tests\r\n* [ ] AFAIK, you can then remove the PHPDoc parts that only explain the types (like return values or arguments). But let's test that they appear the same in [PHPDoc](https://phpdoc.org/).\r\n\r\nSome hints:\r\n* One can use the existing PHPdoc as a very good reference, at best it works the same and the documented type is really what the runtime really wants. However, there may be edge cases or cases where it is not \"quite right\" (as obviously it was never enforced by the [PHP] interpreter), so take it with a grain of salt!\r\n* Especially for contributors: Start with one file! Or generally, take it step by step. You can easily do multiple PRs and start small by converting only one or two files to stricter types. It can be gradually done.\r\n\r\n## Alternatives\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered. -->\r\nLeave it as it is, it should stay compatible as PHP is very backwards-compatible. However, modern code and many other programming languages embrace type casting/strict/strong(er) typing, so this is IMHO a good way, we should follow.\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\r\n* Bonus: Maybe we find a linter tool or can configure sth. to alert us about missing type declarations in the future? This would help:\r\n  1. to discover missing declarations\r\n  2. to enforce a new coding style that requires type declarations for PHP code\r\n\r\nAlso, as it is a feature starting with PHP 7, but which has been gradually enhanced, we obviously need to make sure it works with all supported PHP versions:\r\nhttps://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/blob/d23bb748d45bb8cde8f3737b632d7ddd6a383e35/lib/Controller.php#L32-L37\r\n\r\nEdit: corrected canonical location for minimum supported PHP version lookup in PrivateBin internally",

If the screen width becomes smaller, the settings on the right-hand side (day-nightmode, language & theme) should move to the line below right-aligned (as with the bootsrap theme). If the display becomes even smaller, the other settings follow and also move to the line below (left-aligned).

Please explain\n\n#6882 created a cache that sped up circuit construction if only \"append\" (or equivalent \"insert\" at end w/ EARLIEST strategy) was used. If other types of \"insert\", \"delete\", or any other circuit mutation was used (see instances of `_placement_cache = None`), the cache was simply deleted and subsequent mutations (including appends) fell back to the old \"check every moment\" algorithm.\n\n## Describe the solution you would prefer\n\nThere are probably some clever algorithms or data structures that could maintain the placement cache through more types of mutations. Or another option could be if the placement cache was deleted and subsequently the user calls a few \"appends\" in a row, to assume there are more coming and have some code that regenerates the placement cache a-priori. (It'd be nice to see some real-world use cases of large circuits that use mutations other than \"append\", to make sure any solution is optimizing the right thing).\n\n## How urgent is this for you? Is it blocking important work?\n\n<!-- Please choose one of the following options and remove the others -->\n**P3** – I'm not really blocked by it; it's an idea I'm proposing based on principle\n",

It's not possible to ask our users to install a legacy version of ffmpeg, especially since it will require users to build from the source.\n\nTo fix this, we have to decide to use the latest LTS version, 7.1, which is in active maintenance mode.\n\nI believe API changes will be between the current version, 6.0.0, and the new version (7.1.1). So, the current implementation of the wasmedge-ffmpeg plugin will also need to be modified.\n\n\n### Details\n\nThe following action items should be finished:\n\n- [ ] Update to the new ffmpeg version 7.1.1\n- [ ] Modify the implementation of wasmedge-ffmpeg\n- [ ] Ensure the CI passes for building and testing\n\n### Appendix\n\n_No response_",

      "description" : "### What happened?\r\n\r\nOK, so, I'm trying to train a Flux LoRa (Loha to be precise) with one additional embedding\r\nDuring training, samples look like they are really excellent, much more so than without the additional embedding, so this seems to be of great effect. \r\nHowever, in comfyui, i did not get results as good as in the samples (it looked very undertrained). While looking at the console output of comfy, here is what I see : \r\n\r\n> WARNING: shape mismatch when trying to apply embedding, embedding will be ignored 768 != 4096\r\n> WARNING: shape mismatch when trying to apply embedding, embedding will be ignored 768 != 4096\r\n> WARNING: shape mismatch when trying to apply embedding, embedding will be ignored 768 != 4096\r\n> WARNING: shape mismatch when trying to apply embedding, embedding will be ignored 768 != 4096\r\n\r\nOut of curiosity, I looked at the embedding in an Hex editor, since the files are small, well, it was worth a shot and it starts with some json data of what I suppose is the description of the binary data structure of the embedding:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"clip_g\": {\r\n        \"dtype\": \"BF16\",\r\n        \"shape\": [\r\n            4,\r\n            768\r\n        ],\r\n        \"data_offsets\": [\r\n            0,\r\n            6144\r\n        ]\r\n    },\r\n    \"t5\": {\r\n        \"dtype\": \"BF16\",\r\n        \"shape\": [\r\n            4,\r\n            4096\r\n        ],\r\n        \"data_offsets\": [\r\n            6144,\r\n            38912\r\n        ]\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nSo, this makes me wonder if there is an issue with the way the embedding is written to disk since Flux is supposed to be CLIP_L+T5, whereas here, I see CLIP_G+T5 ?\r\n\r\nI trained the same dataset on SDXL to see how the clip_l section looked like and it clearly states \"clip_l\".\r\nIn the SDXL database, the clip_g dimension was [4,1280] while the clip_l dimension was [4,768]\r\n\r\nthe dtype was F32 instead of BF16 and the offsets were doubled, but it was consistent with the output data type of the files I forgot to change from FLOAT32 to BF16 in this second run.\r\n\r\nI tried to change in the Hex editor clip_g to clip_l, but comfy simply ignored the embedding.\r\nI know the embedding must have some kind of effect since running the same seed without the embedding is even worse.\r\n\r\nNow, can someone confirm that, this embedding is actually properly formatted and therefore, there is a bug in the comfyui parser of the embedding, or did I actually found a bug in OneTrainer ?\r\n\r\nThank you, this piece of software is awesome !\r\n\r\n\r\n### What did you expect would happen?\r\n\r\nSame quality between samples during training and comfyui output\r\n\r\n### Relevant log output (this is from Comfyui, just to be clear)\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nWARNING: shape mismatch when trying to apply embedding, embedding will be ignored 768 != 4096\r\nWARNING: shape mismatch when trying to apply embedding, embedding will be ignored 768 != 4096\r\nWARNING: shape mismatch when trying to apply embedding, embedding will be ignored 768 != 4096\r\nWARNING: shape mismatch when trying to apply embedding, embedding will be ignored 768 != 4096\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Output of `pip freeze`\r\n\r\n_No response_",

T\"", "I would still be interested in having this. Say you captioned image \"backgrounds\" (not the people behavior and appearance in it, but the setting they are in, landscape etc). Then it would make sense to generate an \"inverted\" mask with rembg to make it pick up on those parts of the image much faster. I guess one could work out a batch-workflow using imagemagick -negate or something similar to get the same effect, but it would be so much easier and less error prone this way." ],

It seems like something a decorator could handle well.\n\n## Describe the solution you would prefer\n\nIt'd be great if in #5985, the solution could just be \"add the decorator to `QasmUGate`\", something like \n\n```python\n@parameterizable(\"theta\", \"phi\", \"lmda\")\nclass QasmUGate(ops.Gate):\n```\n\n## How urgent is this for you? Is it blocking important work?\n\n<!-- Please choose one of the following options and remove the others -->\n**P3** – I'm not really blocked by it; it's an idea I'm proposing based on principle\n\n## Process Note\n\nFor anyone wanting to take this issue, it's probably worth a mini [RFC](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/main/docs/dev/rfc_process.md) and finding a maintainer (not me) to sponsor it before starting work (assuming this even gets to triage/accepted state). While it's probably below the \"RFC Required\" bar, I think there are enough variables, that having an approved design would be beneficial. (Some things that come to mind: What happens if only some fields are parameterizable? Can/should it work both with dataclasses and with non-dataclasses? Can the implementations be overridden in classes it's applied to? How to apply it in gate class hierarchies (e.g. at the EigenGate level or at each subtype?) Does it interact with mypy typing in any way or are type declarations independent? What's the best way to test it? Is it worth going back and retrofitting existing gates into this model?)",

It will even be hostile to vexes. All mobs, except for endermites, phantoms, guardians, slimes and magma cubes, will try to attack the vindicator in return.\n\n<!--- A clear and concise description of the suggestion --->\n##",

The core logic for assembling the answer changed in recent updates, specifically in the `_run` method of `answer_node.py`, which now processes and merges template/user text and LLM output differently. This likely causes the LLM output to appear outside your custom tags, leaving the tag empty instead of wrapping the LLM output as before [[source]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/blob/37e19de7ab3d8c1ffd8dfd8b789ff52b47f981cb/api/core/workflow/nodes/answer/answer_node.py).\n\nThere’s no documentation or open issue directly tracking this, but similar regressions have happened before when output formatting or merging logic was refactored. If you need a workaround, try adjusting your template or node configuration to see if you can force the LLM output inside the tag, or temporarily revert to 1.4.3 if that’s feasible for your deployment. If you’re using structured output, double-check your schema and model compatibility, as recent changes in structured output handling have also caused related issues for some users [[source]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/20975).\n\nIf you need to track this for a future fix, keep an eye on changes to `answer_node.py` and related workflow node logic in upcoming releases.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

I doubt if this will change the answer of my custom tag.", "<!-- Answer -->\nYou're correct—adding the ArrayFileSegment wrapper only affects how file outputs are handled and does not impact string outputs or the formatting of your custom tags in the answer node. The regression with your custom tag is more likely due to changes in how the answer node parses and merges templates and variables. Specifically, the answer is now assembled by splitting your template into text and variable chunks, then merging them, which can cause issues if the chunk boundaries don't align with your tags (for example, if you have a template like `<tag>{{#llm#}}</tag>`) [[source]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/blob/37e19de7ab3d8c1ffd8dfd8b789ff52b47f981cb/api/core/workflow/nodes/answer/answer_stream_generate_router.py).\n\nIf your tags are ending up empty, it's likely because the variable replacement logic is splitting the template in a way that separates the tag from the variable. This is unrelated to ArrayFileSegment and is instead a subtle change in the template parsing or merging logic. You might be able to work around this by adjusting your template so that the variable is not directly inside the tag, or by experimenting with different placements of your tags and variables. If you need to dig deeper, reviewing the logic in AnswerStreamGeneratorRouter and the template parsers (PromptTemplateParser, VariableTemplateParser) will show exactly how the chunks are split and merged.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

The frontend now uses a custom Rehype plugin that strips or alters any HTML tag that doesn't match the regex /^[a-z][a-z0-9]*$/i, converting it to plain text. This means custom tags (like `<tag>`) are no longer rendered as HTML elements, which is why your LLM output appears outside the tag or the tag appears empty in the UI, even though the backend (and debug panel) output is correct. This stricter sanitation was likely added for security reasons and is not documented as a breaking change, so it may not have been present or as strict in 1.4.3 [reference](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/blob/37e19de7ab3d8c1ffd8dfd8b789ff52b47f981cb/web/app/components/base/markdown/index.tsx).\n\nTo work around this, you can use only standard HTML tags supported by the renderer, or adjust your template to avoid custom tags. If you need custom tag support, you would need to patch the frontend markdown renderer to relax or remove this restriction.

Only one problem i am getting is, in motion capture, character is moving up in the project i have migrated but its working fine in demo project. I am attaching the video and 1st clip is in new project (where mediapipe project is migrated into) and second clip is of demo project itself where its working normal. Please have a look of the video and guide us for a solution to prevent the character going up. Thank you\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ybo_WQdKIMIhCz8ZD49BvVl1Wmk_NBqN/view?usp=sharing\n",

Basically, I *do* want completion on node names when I'm inserting links in roam buffers, but I *don't* want to have to remember that I'm in a roam buffer and therefore use a special keybinding for `org-roam-node-insert`. I just want to insert link with org and have it Just Work™.\r\n\r\nSo, like altering the link following behaviour (as roam [already does](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/blob/3782e88d50f83c5b9fbb4b10df71df3f37e27156/org-roam-id.el#L91)), set org's built-in completion to play nice with roam nodes.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Implementation (if any)\r\n```elisp\r\n(defun org-roam-id-complete (&optional initial-input filter-fn sort-fn require-match prompt)\r\n  \"Read an `org-roam-node', returning its id.\r\n\r\nAll args are passed to `org-roam-node-read'.\"\r\n  (concat\r\n   \"id:\"\r\n   (org-roam-node-id\r\n    (org-roam-node-read\r\n     initial-input filter-fn sort-fn require-match prompt))))\r\n\r\n(org-link-set-parameters \"id\" :complete #'org-roam-id-complete)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWould go [here](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/blob/3782e88d50f83c5b9fbb4b10df71df3f37e27156/org-roam-id.el#L92). I included passing the optional args incase this function is useful in other lisp in the future.\r\n\r\nThis could be augmented with a check of `org-roam-buffer-p` if we wanted to avoid linking outside of roam buffers. I'm not sure if this is relevant, because org doesn't have a default completion mechanism for `id` links, so this implementation doesn't shadow anything.\r\n\r\n(edit to add: happy to PR this if anyone thinks it's worth it)\r\n\r\n#### Possible extensions\r\nIt would be nice to set the title of the node as the default/suggested description for the link, but this doesn't seem possible in a way which doesn't have to account for every link type at once (see [here](https://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/27860/34394) and the docstring of `org-link-make-description-function`).\r\n\r\nFailing that, it might be a good idea to add the title to the history (or future history) of the relevant list, so that it can be easily pulled down as a description. This should be easy enough in the above function with `add-to-history`, but I don't know which list to add to. I could make the change work if I did though!\r\n\r\n### Please check the following:\r\n\r\n- [X] No similar feature requests\r\n",

      "description" : "### Is there an existing issue already for this feature request/idea?\n\n- [x] I have searched for an existing issue, and could not find anything. I believe this is a new feature request to be evaluated.\n\n### What problem is this feature going to solve? Why should it be added?\n\nImporting a db with pg_dump using a single worker is slow. There is also no easy hook for the `SELECT timescaledb_pre_restore();` and `SELECT timescaledb_post_restore();` functions.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nA common pattern is to split the job into pgdumps predata, data, and postdata stages. You generally want to use a single worker when copying the schema, many workers when copying the actual data, and at least one worker when applying constraints at the end depending on how fast that is. The current extra settings flag does not give you the control to do this.\n\nI'm willing to work on this feature. Looking at the existing codebase, this does look like a good first issue assuming prior experience with pg_dump, since the import section is fairly self-contained.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nRunning a shell script by piping to kubectl exec sh). This is pretty close to what we do now, since pg_dump/pg_restore is fairly independent of how it runs.\n\nOther options would be to have a CNPG-I plugin for other restore options like pgcopydb. Another is to not bother with any optimizations but to add six lines to  detect whether timescaledb is a preloaded extension and if so to run the  `SELECT timescaledb_pre_restore();` and `SELECT timescaledb_post_restore();` functions which are required to load the backup correctly, with no API changes and only a fix to import databases with a common extension.\n\n### Additional context\n\nExposing a good API for this is tricky and this is something I'd like a maintainer opinion on. \n\n### Backport?\n\nNo\n\n### Are you willing to actively contribute to this feature?\n\nYes\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct",

      "description" : "**Is there an existing issue for this?**\nI have searched the existing issues and checked the recent builds/commits\n\n**What would your feature do ?**\nImplement a versioned default settings system that allows changing default values for new users without affecting existing users who haven't explicitly set a preference. This feature would enable the team to improve the default user experience for new installations while respecting existing users' workflows.\n\n**Proposed workflow**\n1. Add a `defaultsByInstallVersion` field to SettingParams that tracks different defaults based on installation version:\n   ```typescript\n   {\n     id: 'Comfy.LinkRelease.Action',\n     defaultValue: LinkReleaseTriggerAction.CONTEXT_MENU,\n     defaultsByInstallVersion: {\n       '1.21.3': LinkReleaseTriggerAction.SEARCH_BOX,\n       '1.40.3': LinkReleaseTriggerAction.FUTURE_FEATURE\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. Store an `installedVersion` setting when a user first runs the application. For refernce how to do this, search how `Comfy.TutorialCompleted` setting is set. You may also need to update tests to set this value, unless a test case specifically wants to test things for a new user. Again just search how it is handled for `Comfy.TutorialCompleted`\n\n3. Installed versions can be found in systemStatsStore or as a global variable on window object. When getting a setting's default value:\n   - If user has `installedVersion` >= specified version, use the versioned default\n   - If user has no `installedVersion` (existing user), use the original `defaultValue`\n   - This ensures backward compatibility for existing users\n\n4. The setting store's `getDefaultValue` function would be updated to check `defaultsByInstallVersion` based on the user's installation version\n\n**Additional information**\nThis approach was discussed in PR #3652 as a solution for changing the default link release action from context menu to search box for new users only. The implementation would:\n- Maintain clean separation between user preferences and system defaults\n- Allow progressive enhancement of defaults without disrupting existing users\n- Provide a clear audit trail of when defaults changed\n- Support A/B testing of defaults in the future if needed\n\nRelated discussion: https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_frontend/pull/3652#issuecomment-2447681991",

      "comments" : [ "# :wave: Important: PLEASE READ :wave:\n\nThis issue has been labeled as a **good first issue** and is available for anyone to work on.\n\nIf this is your first time contributing to an open source project, some aspects of the development process may seem unusual, arcane, or some combination of both.\n\n1.  **You cannot \"claim\" issues.** People new to open source often want to \"claim\" or be assigned an issue before beginning work. The typical rationale is that people want to avoid wasted work in the event that someone else ends up working the issue. However, this practice is not effective in open source, as it often leads to \"issue squatting\", in which an individual asks to be assigned, is granted their request, and then never ends up working on the issue. Accordingly, you are encouraged to communicate your intent to address this issue, ideally by providing a rough outline as to how you plan to address the issue or asking clarifying questions, but, at the end of the day, we will take running code and rough consensus in order to move forward quickly.\n2.  **We have a very high bar for contributions.** We have very high standards for contributions and expect all contributions—whether new features, tests, or documentation—to be rigorous, thorough, and complete. Once a pull request is merged into stdlib, that contribution immediately becomes the collective responsibility of all maintainers of stdlib. When we merge code into stdlib, we are saying that we, the maintainers, commit to reviewing subsequent changes and making bugfixes to the code. Hence, in order to ensure future maintainability, this naturally leads to a higher standard of contribution.\n\nBefore working on this issue and opening a pull request, please read the project's [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md). These guidelines and the associated [development guide](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/docs/contributing/development.md) provide important information, including links to stdlib's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), license policy, and steps for setting up your local development environment.\n\nTo reiterate, we **strongly** encourage you to refer to our contributing guides **before** beginning work on this issue. Failure to follow our guidelines significantly decreases the likelihood that you'll successfully contribute to stdlib and may result in automatic closure of a pull request without review.\n\nSetting up your local development environment is a critical first step, as doing so ensures that automated development processes for linting, license verification, and unit testing can run prior to authoring commits and pushing changes. If you would prefer to avoid manual setup, we provide pre-configured [development containers](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/tree/develop/.devcontainer) for use locally or in GitHub Codespaces.\n\nWe place a high value on consistency throughout the stdlib codebase. We encourage you to closely examine other packages in stdlib and attempt to emulate the practices and conventions found therein.\n\n-   If you are attempting to contribute a new package, sometimes the best approach is to simply copy the contents of an existing package and then modify the minimum amount necessary to implement the feature (e.g., changing descriptions, parameter names, and implementation).\n-   If you are contributing tests, find a package implementing a similar feature and emulate the tests of that package.\n-   If you are updating documentation, examine several similar packages and emulate the content, style, and prose of those packages.\n\nIn short, the more effort you put in to ensure that your contribution looks and feels like stdlib—including variables names, bracket spacing, line breaks, etc—the more likely that your contribution will be reviewed and ultimately accepted. We encourage you to closely study the codebase **before** beginning work on this issue.\n\n:sparkles: Thank you again for your interest in stdlib, and we look forward to reviewing your future contributions. :sparkles:\n" ],

My DAG configs were: retries=1000, retry_delay=5 min (300 seconds), max_retry_delay=1h (3600 seconds). My DAG failed ~1000 times and after that Scheduler broke down. After that retries exceeded 1000 and stopped on 1017 retry attempt. \n\nI did my research on this problem and found that this happened due to formula **min_backoff = math.ceil(delay.total_seconds() * (2 ** (self.try_number - 1)))** in **taskinstance.py** file. So retry_exponential_backoff has no limit of try_number and during calculations it can overflow max Float value. So even if max_retry_delay is set formula is still calculating. And during calculations on very large retry number it crashes.\n\nPlease fix bug. \n\nI also did pull request with my possible solution:\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/48057\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/48051\n\nFrom Airflow logs:\n2024-12-09 02:16:39.825\tOverflowError: cannot convert float infinity to integer\n2024-12-09 02:16:39.825\t    min_backoff = int(math.ceil(delay.total_seconds() * (2 ** (self.try_number - 2))))\n2024-12-08 09:29:14.583\t[2024-12-08T06:29:14.583+0000] {scheduler_job_runner.py:705} INFO - Executor reports execution of mydag.spark_submit run_id=manual__2024-11-02T10:19:30.618008+00:00 exited with status up_for_retry for try_number 470\n\nConfigs: \n_with DAG(\n            dag_id=DAG_ID,\n            start_date=MYDAG_START_DATE,\n            schedule_interval=\"@daily\",\n            catchup=AIRFLOW_CATCHUP,\n            default_args={\n                'depends_on_past': True,\n                \"retries\": 1000,\n                \"retry_delay\": duration(minutes=5),\n                \"retry_exponential_backoff\": True,\n                \"max_retry_delay\": duration(hours=1),\n            },\n    ) as dag:_\n\n<img width=\"947\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3307b23-0307-4b4d-b968-3e1984fbe93c\" />\n<img width=\"1050\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f161329c-155c-4d92-b3b4-cf442d6ed036\" />\n\n### What you think should happen instead?\n\nMy pull request: \nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/48057\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/48051\n\n### How to reproduce\n\nUse configs from above.

This occurs in both desktop and iOS versions, but on desktop you can use \"Print to PDF\" as a workaround.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nPDFs with blob-type URLs: are typically generated upon user request (e.g., when clicking a button). My file is from an area reserved to registered users and I cannot share the URL.\n\n### Actual result\n\n- In the desktop version (I use Windows) the \"Save As\" command in context menu is disabled and CTRL+S does not work\n- On iOS, “Save to File” is missing from the share menu because the file is shared as link only.\n\n### Expected result\n\n- On desktop, the \"Save as\" command should be available, if possible. Other Chromium browsers have the same behavior as Brave, while Firefox can download the document normally.\n- On iOS, Safari can download the file because the share menu mode is “1 document and 1 link” and Save to File is available. Brave should probably implement this feature in the same way as Safari.\n\n### Reproduces how often\n\nEasily reproduced\n\n### Brave version\n\n1.78\n\n### Device/iOS version\n\niPhone, iOS 18.5\nWindows 11\n\n### Affected browser versions\n\n- [ ] latest AppStore\n- [ ] latest TestFlight\n- [ ] previous TestFlight\n\n### Reproducibility\n\n- [ ] with Brave Shields disabled\n- [ ] in the latest version of mobile Safari\n\n### Miscellaneous information\n\n_No response_",

Unfortunately I was actually trying to fix this issue, which is about the shell printing the right updates, so that got all jumbled up which let to a deeper issue which is that the `dolt sql` shell doesn't have the right information to determine when to print the Query OK line. Specifically, mysql shell will not print any of them if it's executing statements in a batch.\n\nThis is best shown here:\n\n```\n$ echo \"create table t (i int); drop table t;\" | mysql -u root -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3306 mydb\n$ mysql -u root -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3306 mydb\nWelcome to the MySQL monitor.

MySQL client knows that you are not in an interactive terminal. `dolt sql` shell doesn't actually know this, and as a result the changes I made to the shell break lots of tests because where ever we stream in statements, we print out `Query OK` in many places that aren't expected in tests.\n\nThe equivalent dolt operations:\n```\n$ echo \"create table t (i int); drop table t;\" | dolt sql\n\n\n$ dolt sql\n# Welcome to the DoltSQL shell.\n# Statements must be terminated with ';'.\n# \"exit\" or \"quit\" (or Ctrl-D) to exit. \"\\help\" for help.\nmydb/main> create table t (i int);\nEmpty set (0.01 sec)\n\nmydb/main*>  drop table t;\nEmpty set (0.01 sec)\n\nmydb/main>\n```\n\nAs you can see, there are empty lines printed in the pipe case, and \"Empty Set\" returned in the shell case. The changes proposed by James in https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/pull/9291 and ultimately what claude tried to do don't toggle based on if the input is a pipe or interactive, and as a result will always print `Query OK` - which is not only confusing, but breaks my dolt tests which don't expect them to be there\n\nNext Steps:\n - Get `dolt sql` wise to the way it's being operated. This may require looking at the mysql shell code, or something else. One way or another we need to be aware of when printing these things makes sense.\n - Apply the SET change to GMS, and isolate it to fixing tests only in Dolt and Doltgres. Don't modify the shell output at this stage because it breaks a lot of tests and become intractable.\n -  Update the shell, in the way proposed by James, to get the right information out in the right context.\n\nIn some of these changes, we are going to want to toggle behavior with an environment flag such that we won't stop the development train with broken builds. We kind of need better options to optionally enable behaviors while also getting them in the pipeline for testing.", "Seems like our output for `INSERT` differs from mysql as well\n\nmysql\n```\nmysql> create table enum_table (i int primary key, e enum('a','b'));\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)\n\nmysql> insert into enum_table values (1, 'a'), (2, 'b');\nQuery OK, 2 rows affected (0.01 sec)\nRecords: 2  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0\n\nmysql> create table uv (u int primary key, v varchar(10));\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)\n\nmysql> insert into uv values (0, 'bug'), (1, 'ant');\nQuery OK, 2 rows affected (0.00 sec)\nRecords: 2  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0\n```\n\ndolt\n```\ntmp/main*> create table enum_table (i int primary key, e enum('a','b'));\ntmp/main*> insert into enum_table values (1, 'a'),(2,'b');\nQuery OK, 2 rows affected (0.00 sec)\ntmp/main*> create table uv (u int primary key, v varchar(10));\ntmp/main*> insert into uv values(0, 'bug'),(1,'ant');\nQuery OK, 2 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n```" ],

It seems a little unorthodox to be creating a status bar in this way (running tail on a text file).", "@samerickson Your screenshot shows exactly the issue. You should only see the last line, \"sizth line\" as the status.\r\n\r\n### What I'm trying to achieve\r\n\r\nStatus command may want to output information as soon as it's available. If shortly after that another piece of information is available, it will output another line. Normally, it works fine. Only if multiple updates happened during the bar startup, both old and new status appear together.\r\n\r\nAs an example, my program is affected. https://github.com/shibe2/sklt", "I misunderstood the issue, I thought you were having multiple status bars. Status bars will display newline characters inline. This is useful if you want something like `lsblk` to be displayed, which is normally a block of text, but in a status bar, you need that information to be in a single line. \r\n\r\nIn your case, if you are trying to only display the last line of the file, you need to change your tail command. Tail defaults to showing the last 10 lines of a file, to make it display **Only** the last line, use: `tail -n 1`. \r\n\r\nAs for getting your project to function correctly, I have created an issue https://github.com/shibe2/sklt/issues/1, as I cannot seem to make your project function. ", "You can change your bar config to link to a script containing the following:\r\n```\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\nwhile true;\r\n    printf \"%s %s\\n\" \"$(date +%D)\" \"$(date +%r)\"\r\n    sleep 1\r\ndone\r\n```\r\nAs for getting it to display the current keyboard layout, you can have a look at this project as well:\r\nhttps://gitlab.com/racy/sway-keyboard-layout/blob/master/sway-keyboard-layout. This makes your code footprint a lot smaller, but I am unsure of the resource consumption differences. \r\n", "Thanks for your prompt reply on the `sklt` issue. Everything appears to work, though for the first minute you have the time listed twice. To circumvent this, it would be best to remove the date in your project its self, rather than trying to remove it using command-line utilities such as `tail`", "> Status bars will display newline characters inline. This is useful if you want something like lsblk to be displayed, which is normally a block of text, but in a status bar, you need that information to be in a single line.\r\n\r\nThis is not useful with *line protocol*, where each line is a new status. But even if it was useful, it is currently inconsistent: if the command outputs multiple lines immediately, they appear together; but if it does after some delay, only the last line appears.\r\n\r\n> In your case, if you are trying to only display the last line of the file, you need to change your tail command.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, my `tail` example is purely for reproduction of the issue.\r\n\r\nI also have a program that only outputs time. It uses less resources and it is more precise than a simple script. I.e. the time on screen updates almost exactly when the second changes on the computer clock.\r\n\r\nAs for your suggestion about keyboard layout, it seems to use `xkblayout` command, and I can't find it in Arch Linux repositories. Also, I tried to use X protocol for getting the current keyboard layout, but the change notification did not work under Wayland. And polling requires a compromise between CPU usage and indicator lag, so I'd like to avoid it. With Sway 1.2 it is possible to get proper notifications about keyboard layout switching, which I used in my program.", "This seems like an easy fix for anyone interested; just add some logic here: https://github.com/swaywm/sway/blob/master/swaybar/status_line.c#L117 to find the last line that was read.", "@ianyfan, for testing purposes, how can I get my built (but not installed) sway branch to stop using the system `swaybar`? Doesn't seem to respect $PATH", "It should use PATH. You can also set `swaybar_command`.", "Or start it manually. For example, if you've compiled it in a directory called `build`, then you should be able to invoke it like `build/swaybar/swaybar -b bar-0` (replacing the bar id appropriately).", ":eyes: ", "> This seems like an easy fix for anyone interested; just add some logic here: https://github.com/swaywm/sway/blob/master/swaybar/status_line.c#L117 to find the last line that was read.\n\nHello. Based on what I understood from the issue and the comment above, I believe I solved the issue with the following code (starting from https://github.com/swaywm/sway/blob/master/swaybar/status_line.c#L114):\n\n```\t\t\n\t\tsway_log(SWAY_DEBUG, \"Using text protocol.\");\n\t\tstatus->protocol = PROTOCOL_TEXT;\n\t\t// Gets starting address (relative to buffer) of last line on file\n\t\tsize_t i;\n\t\tsize_t lastline = i = 0;\n\t\twhile(status->buffer[i] != '\\0' && i <= status->buffer_size) {\n\t\t\tif(status->buffer[i] == '\\n' && status->buffer[i+1] != '\\0') {\n\t\t\t\tlastline = i + 1;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\ti++;\n\t\t}\n\t\tstatus->text = status->buffer + lastline; // <== ASSIGN HERE\n\t\t// intentional fall-through\n\tcase PROTOCOL_TEXT:\n\t\twhile (true) {\n\t\t\tif (status->buffer[read_bytes - 1] == '\\n') {\n\t\t\t\tstatus->buffer[read_bytes - 1] = '\\0';\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\terrno = 0;\n\t\t\tread_bytes = getline(&status->buffer,\n\t\t\t\t\t&status->buffer_size, status->read);\n\t\t\tif (errno == EAGAIN) {\n\t\t\t\tclearerr(status->read);\n\t\t\t\treturn true;\n\t\t\t} else if (errno) {\n\t\t\t\tstatus_error(status, \"[error reading from status command]\");\n\t\t\t\treturn true;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tstatus->text = status->buffer;    // <== REASSIGN HERE\n\t\t}\n\tcase PROTOCOL_I3BAR:\n\t\tstatus->text = status->buffer;  // <== REASSIGN HERE\n\t\treturn i3bar_handle_readable(status);\n\n```\n\nNotice I had to reassign status->text three times in the code, otherwise the pointer would get stuck and the output wouldn't update correctly (obviously I would remove the comments in upper case on PR). \nI believe the logic here is correct, but is the code appropriate for merging?  And if not, how would I write the code to be more secure/appropriate to the project?\nSince this would be my first time contributing, and I didn't find any specifications on how to do so, I figured it would be better to ask than to bother anyone with phony PRs. \nThank you!" ],

This method of invocation is far superior - as I now kick off numerous different workflows simultaneously (each makes their own branch) and have great support for things like CI/CD integrations built into GitHub\n\n### Why is this needed?\n\nDoing this locally is a manual pain with branch management. It also lacks automatic PR creation - which acts as a way to store state, including multimedia, that is tough to do in a CLI\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

The second step is good because it's really independent of the lowering method, so all the IR construction logic can be shared across all lowering options.",

      "comments" : [ "Wondering if it makes sense to convert some of these. Specifically the two I added:\n- `GetStructField`: DataFusion has a similar `get_field` already we could use, but it operates by field name instead of index, so it has to find the right field by name for each batch which adds some overhead, which is some of the downside it seems to the UDFs over logical and physical expressions which can optimize these cases at analysis time. Implementing a custom ScalarUDF also doesn't really make sense because as a user you would never select a nested field by index, always by name.\n- `GetArrayStructFields`: There's no equivalent DataFusion expression AFAIK, but the same thing above applies where there's not really a use cases for using this function directly, Spark just creates this at analysis time from an `ExtractValue` operation", "@Kimahriman what you say makes sense. For `GetStructField` and `GetArrayStructFields` it may not be useful to convert to ScalarUDFImpl" ],

This can be fixed by just writing `return`. In an arrow function you cannot do this. I guess that is why the unicorn eslint plugin introduced that option I meantioned.

In other cases of the rules the action can simply remove `undefined`, while here it is not the case, we have to turn it into `{}`. And to avoid triggering `noEmptyBlock` this should even be `{ return; }`, `{ ; }`, or `{ /* undefined value */ }` that look hacky.", "@Conaclos I agree. ", "Actually I even wonder if we should not always allow `return undefined`. This is a bit a stretch, however I find that `retrun;` and `return undefined;` convey different meaning: the first indicates an early return in a function that doesn't return any value (`fn(): void`), while the second one indicates a function that explicitly return the `undefined` value (`fn(): something | undefined`).\nFor example cases like this looks totally fine to me:\n\n```js\nexport function literalVal(literal: Literal): LiteralVal {\n    switch (literal.type) {\n        case \"bigint\":\n            return BigInt(literal.val)\n        case \"number\":\n        case \"string\":\n            return literal.val\n        case \"false\":\n            return false\n        case \"null\":\n            return null\n        case \"true\":\n            return true\n        case \"undefined\":\n            return undefined\n    }\n}\n```\n\nHowever, this could make the rule very different from its unicorn source.\n\nAlso, `useGetterReturn` doesn't accept `return;`, only `return <something>`, including `return undefined` that got flagged by `noUselessUndefined`.", "Yes, I also agree to that. So, noUselessUndefined would only check parameters I guess. ", "will unasign myself from this\nmy personal approach on these Is to use use lodash (rxjs) etc -> noop function for such scenarios, not a fan of () => {return;} or () => {;}\nPossibly better to leave it without auto fix? and user decides how to deal with it?" ],

      "description" : "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\nWhen I initially opened Mbin on mobile (fedia) I knew my first stop was to subscribe to a bunch of communities so my feed comes to life with interesting stuff.\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/023f234c-20ac-4df1-a191-c308af1b3aae\n\n1. Clicking on search I was hoping that I would see at the top of the results a name match result for the \"Montreal\" community\n2. I realized that the term \"Magazine\" means community after clicking on it and looking at the list\n3. Went to search and typed in the name of a city to try to find that the community I know I've seen on Lemmy but the community didn't open.\n4. Searched for a string to open the community, realized there must be some over way to search for the community at this point but figured this would work\n5. The community opens and then I went on a hunt for a subscribe button, finding it in the menu on the side\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nThere are a few ways to handle this, seems like anything helps\n- [ ] (1) An exact string match for a community (less the domain) seems like it could show a \"Community Results\" box that show \"Communities matching your result\". It would contain one or two results and have a \"view more\" link at the bottom if people are in serious onboarding mode and looking to add a lot of related communities \"montreal_food\" and \"montreal_housing\" etc.\n- [ ] (2) The term Magazine has become confusing, especially now that we are federated and viewing /c/ urls for Communities in Lemmy and PieFed. It's easy to get overwhelmed/confused with fediverse software and that step of \"Oh, this is a community... I think... maybe it's a superset, maybe it's a subset, OK note to self this is probably a community\" I'm not seeing the benefit, I can definitely see and have experienced the barrier.\n- [ ] (3) The autocomplete for this is excellent, but I was hoping if a community was selected and the text field above left blank that the \"Community Result\" search box would show up with the community to \"go to the community\"\n- [ ] (4) Maybe allowing a blank search term just shows the latest posts for the community, or goes to the community if it has been selected?\n- [ ] (5) I would suggest a very compact community header that has the name, logo/background image and a subscribe/unsubscribe button and a button to \"expand\" it to show everything. It's hard to know that you are actually on a community and I really only found that I could subscribe by chance. Under the hamburger menu I just don't expect to find elements related to inline content. That's where I expect to find search tools, DMs, profile settings perhaps.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nDetailed above.\n\n** Additional Context **\nI'm a brand new user to Mbin who users Lemmy, Reddit and Piefed so I though I would just note the pain points I hit before I learn the software and stop seeing them. Hope this is helpful and not too annoying.",

Being on mobile the magazine search is not that easy to find, as the header links are hidden in the menu (what you called \"hamburger menu\"), but on desktop you'll see this: \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6dd3f84a-59c8-4031-bf71-0b20648279e0)\n\nThe box that you filled in is an additional filter for the search term, not intended to work on its own. But maybe it should be.\n\nThe magazine panel is only hidden in the menu on mobil, on desktop it looks something like this: \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8b92cc7-28ac-44cb-84ad-70fec82ed8b9)\n\nAnd the indicator that you are in a magazine gets hidden on mobile...\n\nSo things to fix this issue in my opinion:\n- [ ] Add an indicator on mobile that you are inside of a magazine. Preferably use the one already in the header and do not hide it on mobile\n- [ ] Add magazines to the results of the \"normal\" search" ],

The issue has a clear, reproducible problem: the search API key gets wiped out whenever settings are saved, even when modifying unrelated configuration like LLM provider settings.\n\n**What's clear from the report:**\nThe reproduction steps are well-defined - add a search API key, change any other setting, save, and the API key disappears. This suggests a classic form handling issue where either the search API key field isn't being properly included in the save operation, or there's a state management problem where the key gets overwritten during the settings update process.\n\n**Technical factors to consider:**\nThis is likely a UI/UX issue in the settings form logic. The problem could stem from a few common patterns - maybe the form is only serializing visible or \"dirty\" fields, or there's separate state management for different setting categories that aren't being merged properly. It could also be a simple oversight where the search API key field isn't included in the save payload.\n\n**What needs investigation:**\nYou'll want to examine the settings form component and trace through the save flow. Check how form data is collected, whether all fields are being included in the request, and how the backend processes the settings update. Look at the network requests when saving to see if the API key is even being sent.\n\n**Next steps:**\nStart by reproducing the issue locally, then inspect the settings save functionality in the frontend code. Check the form serialization logic and the API call that handles settings updates. This feels like the kind of bug where the fix might be adding a single field to a form data object or ensuring proper state merging.", "I'm on it! mamoodi can [track my progress at all-hands.dev](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/cd964620c9db45c08a0a4241c0e73aa4)" ],

      "description" : "## Issue: KYC Modal Integration and Flow Assembly\n\nWelcome aboard. We're glad to have you contributing to **KindFi**, a Web3 crowdfunding platform for real-world impact. This issue involves assembling and connecting the full KYC verification process in the KindFi modal component. This is a key milestone before we integrate with the live KYC server.\n\n---\n\n### Background\n\nAll five components for the KYC process have been implemented individually in issues #192, #193, #194, #195, #196. However, these components are not yet connected in a seamless flow within the modal. Your task is to integrate them into a single cohesive user experience.\n\n---\n\n### Objectives\n\nConnect all the KYC verification steps within the modal and create necessary files, actions, and hooks to prepare for server integration.\n\n---\n\n### Tasks\n\n1. **Connect all KYC steps in the modal**:\n   - Uncomment and properly integrate the imports in `kyc-modal.tsx`\n   - Implement the full KYC step flow (Steps 1–5) with correct state transitions\n   - Ensure data flows correctly between steps and is maintained in modal state\n\n2. **Create necessary API integration files**:\n   - Create API client functions for communication with the KYC server\n   - Include error handling and retry logic\n   - Show appropriate loading and success/failure states to the user\n\n3. **Implement KYC hooks and centralized state management**:\n   - Develop a context or hook to manage overall KYC state\n   - Ensure state persistence through browser refreshes or navigation\n   - Validate inputs across all steps\n\n4. **Testing and Documentation**:\n   - Write comprehensive tests for each step and the full flow\n   - Document how the integration works for future contributors\n---\n\n### Contribution Checklist\n\n- [ ] Join our **Telegram community** to stay updated and connect with maintainers and contributors. The link is in the README. Ask here if you need it.\n- [ ] Provide an **initial update within 24 hours** of being assigned the issue. Let us know if you're starting or facing any blockers.\n- [ ] **Do not fork the repository**. Instead, accept the invitation sent to your email to collaborate directly.\n- [ ] **Enable signed commits**. This verifies you are a real contributor. Use [[this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification) to set it up.\n- [ ] For any questions (e.g., local setup, `.env`), ask in the **Telegram channel**.\n\n---\n\n### References\n\n- PR #249: Refactoring of KYC verification flow components\n- Components location: `apps/web/components/shared/kyc/`\n- Existing hooks: `apps/web/hooks/kyc/`\n\n---\n\n### Technical Resources\n\n- [[KindFi Code Style Guide](https://kindfis-organization.gitbook.io/development/code-and-design-guide-style-and-conventions)](https://kindfis-organization.gitbook.io/development/code-and-design-guide-style-and-conventions)\n- [[How to Contribute](https://kindfis-organization.gitbook.io/development/how-to-contribute)](https://kindfis-organization.gitbook.io/development/how-to-contribute)\n- [[Stellar Smart Contracts](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/smart-contracts)](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/smart-contracts)\n- [[Trustless Work Escrow Docs](https://docs.trustlesswork.com/)](https://docs.trustlesswork.com/)\n\n---\n\nIf you have any doubts, please ask in the Telegram group.

I have extensive experience managing application state efficiently and integrating server-side processes. As a **Diamond Contributor on OnlyDust**, I have a proven track record of delivering high-quality code and collaborating effectively within the Web3 community.\n\n## Motivation\n\nI have contributed to this project before and would love to continue improving its architecture and functionality.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nTo address the requirements of issue [#252](https://github.com/kindfi-org/kindfi/issues/252), I will focus on state management and preparing KYC verification steps for seamless server integration.\n\n### 1. Implement Efficient State Management\n- **Refactor State Handling:** Optimize how KYC steps are stored and retrieved to ensure better performance and maintainability.\n- **Context API/Zustand Integration:** Implement a centralized state management system using **Zustand** for consistent and efficient state updates across the verification flow.\n\n### 2. Cleanup and Prepare for Server Integration\n- **Modularize Verification Steps:** Break down KYC verification steps into reusable and composable components.\n- **Ensure Server-Readiness:** Structure the codebase to seamlessly integrate API responses and minimize refactoring when backend endpoints are available.\n- **Implement Loading and Error States:** Improve user feedback by adding clear loading indicators and error handling for each verification step.\n\n### 3. Improve Form Handling\n- **Validation Enhancements:** Retest and Ensure that KYC input fields are properly validated before submitting data to the server.\n- **Optimize API Calls:** Ensure efficient data submission.\n\n## Technical Implementation\n\n- **Framework:** Next.js 14 for optimal SSR and SSG support.\n- **State Management:** Zustand for efficient global state handling.\n- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui for consistent UI components.\n- **API Integration:** Prepare API handlers and types for seamless integration with the backend.\n\n## Timeline\n\nI plan to deliver a draft pull request within **48-72 hours**, covering:\n\n- Refactored state management for KYC verification steps.\n- Cleanup of existing verification flow to prepare for API integration.\n- Implementation of error handling, validation, and UI feedback improvements.\n\nFurther refinements will be made based on feedback and testing.\n\n## Availability\n\nI am ready to dedicate the necessary time and effort to ensure the successful and timely completion of this feature. I'm usually at work from 9am to 5pm (GMT+1) but my schedule is usually flexible, allowing for prompt communication and collaboration when needed.\n\n## Additional Information\n\nFor any further details or clarifications, feel free to reach out to me.

Here's a screenshot for reference:\r\n\r\n![Comment thread in lobsters; the upvote arrow is a white rectangle over a dark background](https://seirdy.one/misc/lobsters_forced_colors.png).\r\n\r\nPossible solutions, in descending order of desirability from my perspective:\r\n\r\n- Render the upvote as an SVG. A simple static SVG-Tiny should do the trick.\r\n- Render the upvote as a plain old PNG\r\n- Render the upvote using icon fonts",

Dark mode text-color changes will then automatically carry over to arrow color changes, *and* it'll play very well with customizations ranging from forced-colors to custom userstyles. It'll also be easier to maintain by introducing one less dark-mode adjustment.\n\nAs for distinguishing the red arrows form the gray ones in a way that doesn't depend solely on color: that's a tricky one. Perhaps the icon itself could be altered or enlarged, or it could receive a visible CSS decoration.\n\nThe orange site has an interesting approach: it just hides the button but adds an \"unvote\" hyperlink to the comment's controls.\n\n-- \nSeirdy\n", "I was just reminded of this by the filing of 1641. Since the bug was filed, we changed how we draw the upvote arrows to use a unicode 25B2 rather than draw a shape with border/background colors.\n\n@Seirdy can you confirm if this is still an issue for you? I tried to reproduce and couldn't, but the Firefox settings UI has changed from what you describe so I'm not certain I'm testing the same thing." ],

This breaks expected behavior and makes error handling impossible.\n\n**To Reproduce**\n\n```rust\nuse object_store::gcp::GoogleCloudStorageBuilder;\n\n#[tokio::main]\nasync fn main() {\n    let client_builder = GoogleCloudStorageBuilder::new()\n        .with_bucket_name(\"asd\")\n        .with_service_account_key(\"{\\\"private_key\\\": \\\"-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\\\", \\\"private_key_id\\\": \\\"hey\\\", \\\"client_email\\\": \\\"asd@asd.com\\\", \\\"type\\\": \\\"service_account\\\"}\");\n\n    if let Err(err) = client_builder.build() {\n        println!(\"Error: {:?}\", err);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n```\nthread 'main' panicked at XXX/object_store-0.12.2/src/gcp/credential.rs:134:53:\ncalled `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: Custom { kind: InvalidData, error: \"section end \\\"-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\\\" missing\" }\n```\n\n**Expected behavior**\nThe builder should return an error if the private key is malformed, not panic.\n\n**Additional context**\nThe panic occurs due to this code:\n\n```rust\n// Reading from string is infallible\nmatch rustls_pemfile::read_one(&mut reader).unwrap() {\n    Some(Item::Pkcs8Key(key)) => Self::from_pkcs8(key.secret_pkcs8_der()),\n    Some(Item::Pkcs1Key(key)) => Self::from_der(key.secret_pkcs1_der()),\n    _ => Err(Error::MissingKey),\n}\n```\n\nThe `unwrap()` assumes infallibility, which is incorrect for malformed inputs.\n",
