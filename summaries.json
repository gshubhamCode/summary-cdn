Why not reformat this to make it more consistent and informative?\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n I'm envisioning a table, listing the same info for each app:\n\n- Name (which links to the app, as currently)\n- Perhaps a small screenshot\n- Brief description of what it does\n- Platform(s) supported\n\nAlso, we currently have one page for Briefcase and one for Toga; they have some apps in common and some unique, and there's no mechanism to sync these. Considering how often people ask about examples, I think it might make more sense to put one combined page on the main site, and potentially link to it from both docs. It would also then make sense, I imagine, to add a column for \"BeeWare component(s) used\". \n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nWe could still maintain separate pages, but I'm not sure if there's a good way to make sure they stay in sync with each other. It's also not clear, currently, from just looking at one, which of the apps also use the other.\n\nIf we do keep the individual pages, it seems redundant to mention that each app uses the tech in question.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

I disabled Windows search indexing on my Nextcloud directory because windows kept on downloading files I wanted to only keep online every time I searched for something in the parent folder.\n\nThe search function in the Nextcloud tray menu is able to find the desired sub folder, but clicking the folder only opens the containing folder and not the folder itself. This is useless to me because, as said, there are a lot of different folders and the folder names are too similar.\n\nIt looks like Nextcloud just opens the containing folder for folders or files. It would be nice if there was at least a context open to allow opening folder or files.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nOpen folder or file by default and have open containing folder the context menu option, but that risks messing with other people's workflow since open containing folder is the current behavior.",

However, the page doesn't do anything outside of stopping the spinner to show the request finished. No error message is shown to direct me to how to fix the issue.\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n1. Take an offer\n2. Send the collateral\n3. Attempt to submit an invoice with a small PPM to force failure\n4. Notice no message comes up\n5. Check the dev console and look at the failed call in the Network tab.\n6. Cry a little\n\n**Expected behavior**\nI expected that a failure would show a toast or something to tell me how to fix the problem. The message returned from the API has the information I would need. It just should be surfaced in the UI so I don't have to go looking through the Network tab to find the solution.\n\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\n - OS: PopOS\n - Browser: Tor Browser\n - Version: 14.5.4\n",

How and when should colors be applied. I suspect we could use this for all color tokens we have included.\n<img width=\"580\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d0893f28-5df2-4254-b340-16d5b583c2a0\" />\n\nWe include deprecated colors in our documentation. I suspect we should just remove these.\n<img width=\"795\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26904eae-d89b-44ef-b4fb-521eb6141e3c\" />\n\nWe don't say it explicitly, but I'm fairly certain we do **not** want people to use these colors for anything other than data visualization.\n<img width=\"798\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/300099a8-a998-41aa-8905-ed0060e92210\" />\n\nMaybe this is a topic for another issue, but for the color palettes page, it's never been quite clear to me when and how we expect folks to use these colors.\n<img width=\"1113\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54f44cb7-2ff7-4e1b-b392-58fa5c1430b7\" />",

However, if I set up a rule to append to a note, no space is added between the note and added text. I'm ok with either behavior, but would prefer it to be consistent.\n\n### How can we reproduce the issue?\n\nSelect a transaction, bulk edit note, prepend or append, type anything in. You will notice a space is placed in between the old and new text.\n\nCreate a rule (or just use the rule editor to bulk edit) that prepends or appends to a note, run it, you'll see that no space is added.\n\n### Where are you hosting Actual?\n\nDocker\n\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\n\nChrome, Firefox\n\n### Operating System\n\nWindows 11",

      "comments" : [ "DataFlex uses a lot of different file extensions, some of which will likely have conflicts. Modern DataFlex uses a common workspace structure, such as `AppSrc/cMyClass.pkg`. Searching for [NOT is:fork path:Appsrc/**.pkg](https://github.com/search?type=code&q=NOT+is%3Afork+path%3AAppsrc%2F**.pkg\n) narrows it down to effectively DataFlex source code files and provides 900+ results. Many of the other file extensions are nowhere near that many, so it won't meet the minimum usage requirements.\n\nGiven that there are so many file extensions in use, maybe a better initial approach could be to add support for DataFlex without specifying `extensions` or `filenames` to avoid conflicts. And DataFlex source repositories can use `.gitattributes` overrides for the relevant extensions instead. Obviously not ideal, but it would at least provide recognition for the DataFlex language, and that's a great starting point.\n\nI see there is some precedence for languages without specifying file extensions, such as for Elvish transcripts from PR #6302, which is mainly used inside markdown files. @lildude and @NilsSve, I can help and put up a PR for adding the DataFlex language without specifying any file extensions, would that work?\n", "Hi Sonny,\n\nIf you are asking me, yes, that would help! The current repositories at @NilsSve are using .gitattributes exactly as suggested.", "> I see there is some precedence for languages without specifying file extensions, such as for Elvish transcripts from PR [#6302](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/pull/6302), which is mainly used inside markdown files. [@lildude](https://github.com/lildude) and [@NilsSve](https://github.com/NilsSve), I can help and put up a PR for adding the DataFlex language without specifying any file extensions, would that work?\n\nIt would \"work\" but it won't be accepted. The Elvish exception is because there isn't a common extension as it's predominantly used in a markdown files. This is not the case with DataFlex.\n\nI know nothing about DataFlex but wikipedia says \"DataFlex is an object-oriented high-level programming language and a fourth generation visual tool for developing Windows, web and mobile software applications on one framework-based platform.\"\n\nWe do not add support for frameworks, hence we support Ruby, but not Rails, so the right thing to do is concentrate on only the language files. I'd expect the language to have a common extension and structure that can be identified.  This should be what is added first, assuming usage meets requirements, and then users can use the overrides to classify the other extensions if they want.\n\nIf the language predominantly uses a generic extension like `.pkg` (poor design decision IMO), this can be added the `generic.yml` file and a heuristic will be used to identify the language, but be warned: this heuristic _must_ be very accurate to only identify DataFlex files and must be linear and performant. It's better for this regex to under identify DataFlex files than misidentify other languages.", "> It would \"work\" but it won't be accepted. The Elvish exception is because there isn't a common extension as it's predominantly used in a markdown files. This is not the case with DataFlex.\n\nI see. That makes sense. DataFlex is an old language that's been around in its current object-oriented form for 20+ years. Its use is mainly for database business applications, for Windows and web apps. It unfortunately doesn't have a single dedicated file extension, and the convention is to use one of a set of extensions representing the main purpose of the specific DataFlex source file. Such as `.vw` for a view, and other extensions for database business logic etc. The `.pkg` extension is typically used for reusable classes, which is why it's the predominant extension seen on GitHub.\n\n> If the language predominantly uses a generic extension like .pkg (poor design decision IMO), this can be added the generic.yml file and a heuristic will be used to identify the language, but be warned: this heuristic must be very accurate to only identify DataFlex files and must be linear and performant. It's better for this regex to under identify DataFlex files than misidentify other languages.\n\nThat sounds like a great idea, thanks! I will pursue this strategy for the `.pkg` file extension since it's the most commonly used extension. I'll follow the instructions and add it to `generic.yml` with heuristics and tests. Thanks again!", "And may I add that DataFlex has two frameworks. One for Windows and one for the Web, with overlaps between them for datadictionaries for consistent database behaviour.\n\nHowever, the frameworks are not optionals/add-ons like in many other languages. Instead they are an integrated part of the DataFlex language. And they are written in the DataFlex language.\n\nSure, a web-based DataFlex application also uses javascript libraries and many other parts needed for a modern webapp, but those files are not part of the frameworks. The build in frameworks are more guided towards how to develop applications more easy, fluently and make the code more robust and easier to follow." ],

These enhancements aim to improve how citizens interact with the issue reporting and tracking flow.\n\n---\n\n## 1. \uD83D\uDCCB Copy Issue Link Button\n\n### Problem\nThere’s currently no easy way to share a direct link to a specific issue.\n\n### Solution\n- Add a **copy-to-clipboard** button (copy icon) near each issue title.\n- Clicking it should copy the full permalink of the issue (e.g., `https://civix.app/issues/42`) to the user’s clipboard.\n- Display a **toast notification** confirming the action.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```jsx\n<IssueHeader>\n  <h2>{issue.title}</h2>\n  <CopyLinkButton issueId={issue.id} />\n</IssueHeader>\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2. \uD83C\uDF89 Submission Confirmation\n\n### Problem\nAfter reporting an issue, users aren’t clearly informed about success or what to do next.\n\n### Solution\n- Show a **modal popup** confirming successful submission.\n- Include the **new issue ID** (e.g., Issue #42).\n- Offer two clear next steps:\n  - ✅ View the reported issue\n  - ➕ Report another issue\n\n### Mock Layout\n\n```\n+-----------------------------+\n|  \uD83C\uDF89 Thank You!             |\n|  ✓ Issue #42 reported!     |\n|                             |\n|  [ View Issue ] [ Report Another ] |\n+-----------------------------+\n```\n\n---\n\n## 3. \uD83D\uDD22 Smart Character Counters\n\n### Problem\nUsers can’t see how many characters they’ve typed or how close they are to a limit.\n\n### Solution\n- Add **live character counters** to all long-text input fields (e.g., description).\n- Use color indicators:\n  - \uD83D\uDFE2 Normal (< 80%): gray text (`text-gray-500`)\n  - \uD83D\uDFE0 Near Limit (≥ 80%): orange text (`text-orange-500`)\n  - \uD83D\uDD34 Over Limit: red text (`text-red-600`)\n- Set configurable limits (e.g., 500 characters).\n\n### Example UI States\n\n| State       | Color         | Example        |\n|-------------|---------------|----------------|\n| Normal      | Gray          | `45 / 500`     |\n| Near Limit  | Orange        | `410 / 500`    |\n| Over Limit  | Red           | `502 / 500`    |\n\n---\n\n## \uD83E\uDDEA Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] All features work correctly in **both Light and Dark modes**\n- [ ] Fully **mobile-responsive**\n- [ ] No regressions or broken functionality\n- [ ] (Optional) Components added to **Storybook** if applicable\n- [ ] Code includes clear, maintainable structure with reusable components\n\n---\n\n## \uD83E\uDDF0 Tech Notes\n\n- Copy button may use [`navigator.clipboard.writeText()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clipboard/writeText)\n- Toasts can use an existing toast component or [React Hot Toast](https://react-hot-toast.com/)\n- Character counter can be a custom hook or inline logic for now\n\n---\n\n## \uD83D\uDCCC Related Areas\n\n- `IssueDetail.jsx`\n- `NewIssueForm.jsx`\n- `components/ui/Toast.jsx`\n- `components/ui/Modal.jsx`\n- `components/CharacterCounter.jsx` (to be created)\n\n---\n\n**Let’s ship these delightfully helpful improvements \uD83D\uDE80**\n",

Usually this occurs when an app is buggy and only sends the leaf certificate without its chain, and explicitly trusting the leaf's issuing intermediate CA seems to fix the problem for them. Crucially, when that intermediate is then rotated their app will break.\r\n\r\nWe could add a toggle, defaulting to false, such as `allowIntermediateCertificates`. If false, it would parse every certificate and ensure that it's self-signed. There might be other ways of achieving the same goal.\r\n\r\nHaving this in from the start could prevent so many misconfigurations by unsuspecting cluster admins.\r\n\r\n(Complication: If we added a list of publicly trusted certs it'd probably need to default to allowing intermediates in that list by default - but we could definitely default to disallowing intermediates everywhere else)",

We have labeled each network set with something like `networking.our.internal.stuff/networkset: <name>` to be able to select a single network set in our network policies. We are concerned that someone accidentally adds the same label to a pod or another resource and thus undermines our network policies.\n\n## Expected Behavior\n<!--- If you're describing a bug, tell us what should happen -->\n<!--- If you're suggesting a change/improvement, tell us how it should work -->\n\nIt would be cool if something similar to `projectcalico.org/orchestrator` exists that lets us specify the resource type we want to select. \n\n## Current Behavior\n<!--- If describing a bug, tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->\n<!--- If suggesting a change/improvement, explain the difference from current behavior -->\n\nWe can use `global()` to select across all global resources, but cannot limit this to just GlobalNetworkSets. We can use an external policy agent, like OPA or kyverno, to disallow setting our networkset labels on resources that are not network sets but this requires an additional system to be deployed.\n\n## Possible Solution\n<!--- Not obligatory, but suggest a fix/reason for the bug, -->\n<!--- or ideas how to implement the addition or change -->\n\nCalico could automatically add a new label, e.g. `projectcalico.org/kind` to each calico resource so that we can select resources by kind and their labels within the same selector. In our case, we could write a selector like `networking.our.internal.stuff/networkset == \"some-name\" && projectcalico.org/kind == \"GlobalNetworkSet\"`\n\nAnother solution would be something like a `kind(GlobalNetworkSet)` expression that does the same, but does not require an extra label.\n\n## Context\n<!--- How has this issue affected you? What are you trying to accomplish? -->\n<!--- Providing context helps us come up with a solution that is most useful in the real world -->\n\nWe want to be as strict as possible in our network policies and close any potential loophole that might exist in our setup.\n",

Their labels are not. It is possible to add the same label to two different network sets potentially allowing much more than expected. Something like `kind(GlobalNetworkSet) && name(Something)` as an expression would perfectly express what we want without allowing any potential misconfiguration.\n\nAgain, we can work around this using additional tooling (VAP/OPA/Kyverno) that verifies that the value of our `networking.our.internal.stuff/networkset` label exactly matches the name of a global network set, but built-in support for more precision when declaring network policies would be really nice!", "Hey guys,\n\nI'd love to try and work on this one. Do you have a general advice where I should start with this?", "Thanks @ivnhk ! \n\nI'd start by familiarizing yourself with how to build and run Calico and its tests. There's a general contribution guide here: https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md (although I'll admit, it might be a tad out of date...)\n\nYou might also want to poke around to see how the (very similar) `orchestrator` label is handled for kubernetes pods. Here's a hint: https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/blob/f3da524b7c6e4cfdf9874b2cddd0233213a1d8f3/libcalico-go/lib/backend/k8s/conversion/workload_endpoint_default.go#L163\n\nWe convert pods into an internal type called \"WorkloadEndpoint\" and when we do, we force a label to be set on it for selection. \n\nFor NetworkSets, you could probably do something similar - or even better since it's an API that we control, you could also add it to the defaulting and validation code for that API - here are some hints on that part:\n\n- https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/blob/master/libcalico-go/lib/clientv3/networkset.go\n- https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/blob/f3da524b7c6e4cfdf9874b2cddd0233213a1d8f3/libcalico-go/lib/validator/v3/validator.go#L269-L270 " ],

To improve maintainability and keep styles organized, we should move these styles into the appropriate `.scss` file and remove the inline style block from the HTML.\n\nThis is a fast follow from this [PR](https://github.com/Techtonica/techtonica.org/pull/615#pullrequestreview-2711350658)\n\n# Tasks:\n\n- [ ] Move all `<style> `block content from `templates/app-form-details.html` into the SCSS file\n- [ ] Remove the entire `<style>` block from the HTML file once verified\n- [ ] Extract shared styles across application forms into reusable mixins or partials\n- [ ] Test to make sure no styles have changed\n- [ ] Move form styles to a new partial `_form.scss` file\n\nBe sure to follow the [CSS SCSS Styling Instructions Wiki](https://github.com/Techtonica/techtonica.org/wiki/CSS-SCSS-Styling-Instructions-Wiki) to adequately make these changes.\n\n# Out of Scope:\n- Refactoring javascript to its own file\n- Refactoring styles of other forms\n- Style changes or updates - all styles should be visually unchanged",

      "description" : "## Bug Report\n\nPlease answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\n\n### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)\n\n1.  Open https://www.kcl-lang.io/ on a mobile device (or resize your browser window to a mobile viewport width).\n2.  Scroll down to the \"Subscribe to Newsletter\" section.\n\n### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)\n\nThe email input field and the \"SUBSCRIBE\" button should ideally be horizontally aligned, or at least optimized for a tidier and more integrated appearance on mobile screens.\n\n### 3. What did you see instead (Required)\n\nThe email input field and the \"SUBSCRIBE\" button are currently displayed vertically (one above the other), resulting in an untidy and less integrated appearance on mobile devices.\n\n**Screenshots:**\n**Current Mobile Layout:**\n<img width=\"120\" alt=\"Mobile - before\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0a8aba4-28e1-4d38-81b5-b3877e3c110a\" />\n*Description:* Shows the input field and button stacked vertically.\n\n### 4. What is your KCL components version? (Required)\n\nN/A. This issue pertains to the User Interface (UI) of the `kcl-lang.io` website on mobile, not to a KCL component or runtime.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Information\n\nI have a local fix that adjusts the CSS/layout of the subscribe form to align the email input field and the \"SUBSCRIBE\" button horizontally on mobile viewports. This change significantly improves the form's appearance and responsiveness.\n\n**Screenshot of Proposed Layout (Local Fix Example):**\n<img width=\"120\" alt=\"Mobile - after\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab312215-2880-4d00-9fb8-16e539437abd\" />\n*Description:* Shows the input field and button horizontally aligned, demonstrating a cleaner look.\n\nI am ready to open a Pull Request (PR) with the proposed changes if this improvement is a good fit for the project. Please let me know if you would like me to proceed with a PR.\n\nThank you for your consideration.",

As of now, Souvlaki leaves it up to the user to change the URL depending on the platform.\r\n\r\nFor Linux, we follow the MPRIS specification, which actually doesn't say much cover art apart from what's in [here](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/mpris-spec/metadata/#mpris:arturl). It only says that local files should start with `file://` and that it should be an UTF-8 string, which is enforced by Rust. Maybe you can look in the source code of desktop managers such as GNOME or KDE, since these read the field to display it on their media player controls.\r\n\r\nFor Windows, we use the _SystemMediaTransportControlsDisplayUpdater_, which has [a thumbnail property](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.media.systemmediatransportcontrolsdisplayupdater.thumbnail?view=winrt-22621#windows-media-systemmediatransportcontrolsdisplayupdater-thumbnail). It accepts multiple formats, but we choose to create it using an URI.

Therefore, we should thrive for full test coverage\n\nHaving a look at the [coverage report](https://app.codecov.io/gh/ros-controls/control_toolbox/tree/ros2-master/control_toolbox), we see that some methods have no coverage, e.g., \n\n- `void PidROS::reset()`\n- `void PidROS::reset(bool save_i_term)`\n- `double PidROS::compute_command(double error, double error_dot, const rclcpp::Duration & dt)`\n- `void PidROS::set_current_cmd(double cmd) { pid_.set_current_cmd(cmd); }`\n- `double PidROS::get_current_cmd() { return pid_.get_current_cmd(); }`\n- `void PidROS::print_values()`\n\nand in general, we have little coverage in testing the input validations.\n\nImprove that by additional tests/test-cases.\n\n## Instructions\nHi, this is a `good-first-issue` issue.

If we set user_managed=True, the new weights that we are passing in should just point to the tensors (i.e. no copy is done). So ideally, if we update the tensors we passed it, the changes should reflect on the AOTI model. This is already tested in test_update_user_managed_buffer.\n\nWhat I want to see tested is if we:\n1. pass in the model weights to AOTI model with user managed\n2. Update the eager model weights with load_state_dict\n3. Check if the update is reflected on the AOTI model.\n\n### Alternatives\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\ncc @chauhang @penguinwu @avikchaudhuri @gmagogsfm @zhxchen17 @tugsbayasgalan @angelayi @suo @ydwu4 @desertfire @chenyang78 @yushangdi @benjaminglass1",

These manual steps create friction for new users and go against Docker's principle of providing a complete, automated setup experience.\n\n## Current Manual Steps\n\nAfter running `docker-compose up --build -d`, users must manually execute:\n\n```bash\ndocker exec -it samarium_app npm run dev\ndocker exec -it samarium_app composer dump-autoload\ndocker exec -it samarium_app php artisan migrate\ndocker exec -it samarium_app php artisan key:generate\ndocker exec -it samarium_app php artisan storage:link\ndocker exec -it samarium_app php artisan db:seed\n```\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nThe Docker setup should be fully automated - users should only need to run:\n1. `cp .env.docker.example .env`\n2. `docker-compose up --build -d`\n\nAfter these commands, the application should be ready to use without any additional manual intervention.\n\n",

For example, link to version 1.7 could initially point to the main downloads page and later redirect to the archive page. Or, whether we need to create stable links for each version\n\uD83E\uDDE9 Code Changes\n\t• Confirm that the correct major and minor version numbers are accessible—or can be made accessible—in code at the point where the error dialog is invoked (see [Initialize_OnError_ShowUI](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK/blob/5ce1f09f8ed314dd647c12be1d910ef894645168/dev/Deployment/DeploymentManager.cpp#L661) and [MddBootstrapInitialize_ShowUI_OnNoMatch](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK/blob/5ce1f09f8ed314dd647c12be1d910ef894645168/dev/WindowsAppRuntime_BootstrapDLL/MddBootstrap.cpp#L1153))\n\t• Construct a version-specific URL using the major and minor version numbers and pass it to the ShellExecute call.\n\uD83D\uDD2E Future-Proofing\n\t• Consider fallback behavior if a version-specific link is unavailable (low priority)." ],

We think that KubeStellar works in more configurations, and they should be tested.\r\n\r\n- Things other than `kind` providing Kubernetes clusters.\r\n- The WDS and/or ITS role played by the hosting cluster.\r\n- The WDS and/or ITS role played by some other pre-existing cluster.\r\n- One new ControlPlane playing both ITS and WDS roles.\r\n\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nDo something. Without expanding the gating CI tests too much (note: I am not asserting exactly how much is too much).\n\n### Want to contribute?\n\n- [ ] I would like to work on this issue.\n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_",

Expected result\n\nFor certain libraries like MUI, we have imports purely for type augmentation like this:\n\n```ts\nimport type {} from '@mui/lab/themeAugmentation';\n```\n\nWe use `import type {}` so that it will only utilize the type information and nothing else during bundling.\n\nIn Biome v1 there was no error, but Biome v2 triggers an error for `lint/correctness/noUnusedImports` and the fixer actually removes the statement which causes other issues. \n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow Biome's Code of Conduct",

Schema Refactor (Supabase)\n- Identify all instances of `owner_id` across the Supabase schema (tables, relationships, foreign keys).\n- Rename the columns to `kinder_id`, preserving existing constraints.\n- Create a properly versioned SQL migration file using Supabase CLI and place it under `services/supabase/migrations/`.\n- Validate database consistency after the rename through Supabase CLI and dashboard tools.\n\n### 2. Backend Adjustments (`services/supabase`)\n- Refactor all code references to `owner_id` across query logic, types, and service utilities.\n- Ensure all affected endpoints and mutations behave as expected with the updated schema.\n\n### 3. Frontend Integration (`apps/web`)\n- Update Supabase queries, types, and hooks that reference `owner_id`.\n- Refactor relevant components or forms handling project ownership or user metadata.\n- Run and update any impacted unit tests or mocks accordingly.\n\n### 4. Documentation\n- Update schema diagrams, ERD references, and technical documentation under `docs/` to reflect the updated field naming and align with project terminology.\n\n###  Deliverables\n- Fully working PR with schema + code changes.\n- A Supabase CLI-compatible SQL migration script.\n- Clear changelog and commit breakdown.\n- Optional: Schema diff or notes for internal dev reference.\n\n**ETA:** I estimate 36–48 hours for full implementation, testing, and documentation updates.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to take it! \nHappy to help standardize and improve the DB structure.\n", "# Hi there, @4c1d-V \uD83D\uDC4B You've been assigned this issue.\n\nOne invite is waiting for you in your email.

It is clear that many contributors are not reading the contributing.MD or the documentation update readme. \n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nWe are a welcoming community and we would like to include all regardless of their learning methodology. Some read, others watch. So, we would like a video to welcome contributors and walk them through the basics of contributing to KubeStellar. Once completed, we can create a shortcut url and give it to anyone with a question about making a contribution. This saves everyone time.\n\n### Are you willing to contribute?\n\n- [ ] Yes, I'd like to help implement this feature.\n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_",

For Windows users, you need to install `sudo` to execute commands with elevated privileges. Here are the steps to install `sudo` on Windows:\n\n### Installing `sudo` on Windows\n\n1. **Using Chocolatey:**\n   - If you don't have Chocolatey installed, you can install it by following the instructions on the [Chocolatey website](https://chocolatey.org/install).\n   - Once Chocolatey is installed, open a command prompt as an administrator and run:\n     ```bash\n     choco install gsudo\n     ```\n\n2. **Using Scoop:**\n   - If you don't have Scoop installed, you can install it by following the instructions on the [Scoop website](https://scoop.sh/).\n   - Once Scoop is installed, open a command prompt as an administrator and run:\n     ```bash\n     scoop install gsudo\n     ```\n\n3. **Using WinGet:**\n   - If you don't have WinGet installed, you can install it by following the instructions on the [WinGet website](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli).\n   - Once WinGet is installed, open a command prompt as an administrator and run:\n     ```bash\n     winget install gerardog.gsudo\n     ```\n\n## Installation Instructions for KubeFlex\n\n1. **Download the KubeFlex CLI:**\n   - Download the latest KubeFlex CLI binary release for your OS/Architecture from the [release page](https://github.com/kubestellar/kubeflex/releases) and copy it to `/usr/local/bin` or another location in your `$PATH`.\n\n   For example, on Linux amd64:\n   ```bash\n   OS_ARCH=linux_amd64\n   LATEST_RELEASE_URL=\\$(curl -H \"Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json\" https://api.github.com/repos/kubestellar/kubeflex/releases/latest | jq -r '.assets[] | select(.name | contains(\"linux_amd64\")) | .browser_download_url')\n   sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 <(curl -L \\$LATEST_RELEASE_URL) /usr/local/bin/kfle\n\n\n2.**Alternative Installation Command:**\nYou can also use the following command, which will automatically detect the host OS type and architecture:\n\n```\nsudo bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubestellar/kubeflex/main/scripts/install-kubeflex.sh) --ensure-folder /usr/local/bin\n\n```\n", "@Krishna-mishra-26 ty for your help here.

This means that, when executing the `createapp` command, new projects generated with this command use ESLint.\r\n\r\nBut the framework monorepo itself has not yet been migrated to ESLint. This is a technical debt that should be resolved.\r\n\r\n# Guidelines\r\n\r\n- ~If [this PR](https://github.com/FoalTS/foal/pull/1260), which updates the way dependencies are managed in monorepo, has not yet been merged, the new branch should be created from `v4-5-0`. Otherwise, it should be created from `master`. Not only will this facilitate the migration to ESLint, it will also avoid the need for additional work later on to manage ESLint dependencies with the new dependency system.~\r\n- Migration to ESLint should not change the style of the framework code (we don't want thousands of line changes to commit). A lot of work had been done at the time in [this PR](https://github.com/FoalTS/foal/pull/561) to make ESLint rules consistent with TSLint rules. There's probably a lot to be learned from this PR.\r\n- When opening the framework repository with VSCode with the ESLint plugin enabled, VSCode should correctly highlight ESLint errors and correct them when saving (if the plugin is configurer to do so).\r\n\r\n# Notes\r\n\r\n- There *might* be useful information [here](https://typescript-eslint.io/getting-started/typed-linting/monorepos/).\r\n- The files `packages/cli/src/generate/specs/app/.eslintrc.js` and `packages/cli/src/generate/templates/app/.eslintrc.js` used by `foal createapp` to generate new projects may cause problems.",

The TSLint rules that were used by `createapp` are the same that the ones currently used for the framework linting.\r\n\r\n", "Hello @deepanshu44 \nI received a notification about this issue in my Github inbox, but I couldn't find any new comments.

I'll let you choose what you think is the best solution.\n\nThe ideal solution where we want to go is this:\n- the method used in the monorepo framework should be the same as that used in new projects generated by `foal createapp`,\n- and the linting rules used in the monorepo framework should be the same as those used in new projects generated by `foal createapp`.\n\nIn this way, when we write documentation and copy-paste code from the framework, the examples are always correctly “linted” when users then copy-paste the same code into their projects.\n\n**Note 1:** if we have this ideal solution with the same rules and the `createapp` rules are still the same and there are linting errors that appear from the framework code, then we can fix them all. Go for it \uD83D\uDC4D \n\n**Note 2:** in tests of the directory `acceptance-tests/`, there are pieces of code that are between comments such as `======== DOCUMENTATION BEGIN =======` and `====== DOCUMENTATION END =======`. In this case, this means that these codes are present in the documentation and should be updated as well in the markdowns in case of modification. You can ignore files in `docs/versioned_docs/` and `docs/i18n/`.\n\nThank you so much, for taking care of this.

It would be useful to provide some type of automation around identifying:\n\n1. what en.yml strings do not have a corresponding localization for zh-CN.yml (what keys in en.yml do not exist in zh-CN.yml)\n1. what keys in zh-CN.yml do not exist in en.yml - these would be old keys in zh-CN.yml that may need removed, or they are misspelled keys\n1. if an en.yml string gets updated/modified, to flag which strings in zh-CN.yml need updated (this requires a clever git blame to determine the line number in the YAML file where a key starts and ensure the commit date of zh-CN.yml for a given key is greater than the commit date for the same key in en.yml. if en.yml is later that indicates that for this key the translation has been updated or modified and may need to be updated or modified for zh-CN. NOTE: a problem with this is if there is a false positive... like we fix a typo in the English or word it better but the Chinese is good and needs no update.. we could figure that out later). Could use https://www.rubydoc.info/github/libgit2/rugged/Rugged/Blame for this\n1. what strings in the application have not be internationalized (these strings are hardcoded)\n\nThere are many tools and approaches for this, but we want to keep deployment simple. The yaml files mean the translations stay with the code which is nice. Could probably use `for_line`. This also might encourage us to avoid multi-line strings in the locale files.\n\nMaybe a rake task is sufficient to start.\n\nAlso worth searching for existing tools that might assist with this as an alternative to writing our own.\n\n┆Issue is synchronized with this [Asana task](https://app.asana.com/0/1202821104799596/1204178484951391) by [Unito](https://www.unito.io)\n",

Most TMS support this out of the box, though there may also be examples of TMS projects that work with the Rails yaml formats. Another benefit of the gettext PO format is that its language/framework independent so if at some point we drop Rails or still have a mixture of Rails and other language/framework for apps in OnDemand, or want to translate error strings in Apache and/or NGINX as well, we can handle all of that in an language independent way.\r\n\r\nExamples: http://pootle.translatehouse.org/, http://zanata.org/ (RedHat product with free open source project support)\r\n\r\nSearch for \"open source translation management systems\" to see many options.", "Still thinking about this.

Feel free to develop on what would you expect from the cli and implementation details \n\nAs a workaround, you can create a shell alias to avoid typing the model name each time.

Now you can use `kai` followed by your prompt. For example:\n\n```sh\nkai \"I want to check the logs of logs.log and find \\n\"\n```\n\nThis will run the command with your input as the argument.\n\nYou can also come up with your own aliases based on your preferences and use cases", "In addition to what @zvdy suggested above, `kubectl-ai` also supports loading the configuration from a well defined path `~/.config/kubectl-ai/config.yaml`\n\nSo, you can do the following:\n\n```sh\n\nmkdir ~/.config/kubectl-ai/\ncat <<EOF > ~/.config/kubectl-ai/config.yaml\nmodel: gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17\nEOF\n\n```\n\nAfter this, you can confirm, the model using:\n\n```sh\nkubectl-ai --quiet model\n```\n\nEverything listed in [this struct](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubectl-ai/blob/main/cmd/main.go#L80) can be configured through this YAML file.\n\nAs you can see, documentation is lacking, feel free to make a PR for updating the README.md, I will be happy to review and get that in.\n\nLet me know if helps.\n\n/cc @noahlwest ", "Thanks a lot @zvdy, I was using an alias like the one you provided already, but I was looking for a better way, something like `kubectl-ai config`.\n\nThanks @droot, I'll work on the issue and keep you updated.", "I like the config approach, a profile like env file or something similar\n\nReminds me of a different feature for context resumption, so I can resume context for LLMs in sessions, so you don't have to explain again what it did and the steps performed yesterday or any other day and makes managing multiple clusters more easy\n\nFeel free to give it a try/PR and own it, I will also peek into that if I manage to get the time", "I updated the documentation in the [PR](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubectl-ai/pull/355).

      "description" : "### System information\n\nTop of tree.\n\n### What is the problem that this feature solves?\n\nCurrently, ONNX’s `shape_inference.infer_shapes` API performs both type and shape inference simultaneously. Type inference is guaranteed in a valid model, but shape inference is on \"best effort\" basis. For some operators (e.g., GridSample, Gather, Reshape, Where, etc), shape inference may fail due to incomplete or complex shape logic, even when type inference could succeed. \nThis tight coupling prevents users from recovering type information when shape inference is unsupported or fails. For example, when users attempt to inject cast nodes or quantize nodes and propagate the type information downstream.\n\n\n**Request:**\nPlease consider adding an option to ONNX’s shape inference API to:\n- Run type inference independently of shape inference, so that type information can be propagated even when shape inference fails or is not implemented for an operator.\n- Alternatively, relax the requirement that shape inference must succeed for type inference to run.\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Enables users and downstream tools to recover and validate type information in more models, improving robustness and usability.\n- Reduces manual workarounds (such as manually setting types for affected nodes).\n- Makes ONNX models more portable and easier to analyze, even when shape logic is incomplete.\n\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n1. Create a separate function to support only type inference `infer_types` (preferable) \n2. Add boolean argument `check_shape=True` to the existing `infer_shapes` API (renaming the function is advisable in this case, `infer_shapes_and_types` or similar).\n\n\n### Describe the feature\n\nDecouple type inference from shape inference.\n\n\n### Will this influence the current api (Y/N)?\n\nDepends on the alternative selected. \nCan maintain backwards compatiblity.\n\n### Feature Area\n\nshape_inference\n\n### Are you willing to contribute it (Y/N)\n\nNone\n\n### Notes\n\nRelated issues https://github.com/onnx/onnx/issues/4934",

      "repositoryName" : "aquasecurity/trivy",
      "description" : "## Description\n\nThis is a feature request to add SHA-512 hash algorithm support to Trivy's SBOM parsing capabilities. Currently, Trivy only supports SHA-1, SHA-256, and MD5 hash algorithms when processing SBOM files.\n\nSome tools, particularly NPM's SBOM generation (`npm sbom`), use SHA-512 hashes for package integrity verification. Adding SHA-512 support would enable Trivy to fully process these SBOMs and preserve important security metadata.\n\n### Current limitations:\n- **CycloneDX**: SHA-512 hashes are ignored and the hashes field becomes `null`\n- **SPDX**: SHA-512 checksums are completely omitted from the output\n\n\n## Current Behavior\n\n### CycloneDX\nIn `pkg/sbom/cyclonedx/unmarshal.go:251-268`, the `unmarshalHashes` function only supports:\n- SHA1\n- SHA256\n- MD5\n\nAny other algorithm (including SHA-512) logs a warning but still creates a digest with an empty algorithm prefix (e.g., `:hashvalue` instead of `sha512:hashvalue`), resulting in malformed digest strings.\n\n### SPDX\nIn `pkg/sbom/spdx/marshal.go:501-522`, the `spdxChecksums` function has the same limitation, returning `nil` for unsupported algorithms.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe limitation stems from `pkg/digest/digest.go` which only defines three algorithms:\n```go\nconst (\n    SHA1   Algorithm = \"sha1\"\n    SHA256 Algorithm = \"sha256\"\n    MD5    Algorithm = \"md5\"\n)\n```\n\n## Desired Behavior\n\nTrivy should support SHA-512 hash algorithm alongside the existing SHA-1, SHA-256, and MD5 support. This would enable Trivy to:\n- Preserve SHA-512 hashes when processing SBOMs from NPM and other tools\n- Generate SBOMs with SHA-512 hashes when appropriate\n- Maintain full compatibility with CycloneDX and SPDX specifications\n\n\n## Impact\n\n- Loss of package integrity verification data\n- Generated SBOMs may be invalid or incomplete\n- Affects tools that rely on SHA-512 for security validation\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n1. Add SHA512 constant to `pkg/digest/digest.go`:\n   ```go\n   const (\n       SHA1   Algorithm = \"sha1\"\n       SHA256 Algorithm = \"sha256\"\n       SHA512 Algorithm = \"sha512\"\n       MD5    Algorithm = \"md5\"\n   )\n   ```\n\n2. Add SHA-512 calculation support in the digest package\n\n3. Update `unmarshalHashes` in CycloneDX:\n   ```go\n   case cdx.HashAlgoSHA512:\n       alg = digest.SHA512\n   ```\n\n4. Update `spdxChecksums` in SPDX:\n   ```go\n   case digest.SHA512:\n       alg = spdx.SHA512\n   ```\n\n## References\n\n- NPM SBOM documentation: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npm-sbom\n- CycloneDX hash algorithm specification: https://cyclonedx.org/docs/1.6/json/#components_items_hashes\n- SPDX checksum specification: https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/package-information/#79-package-checksum-field\n\n## Test Data\n\n### CycloneDX Example\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"http://cyclonedx.org/schema/bom-1.5.schema.json\",\n  \"bomFormat\": \"CycloneDX\",\n  \"specVersion\": \"1.5\",\n  \"components\": [\n    {\n      \"bom-ref\": \"lodash@4.17.21\",\n      \"type\": \"library\",\n      \"name\": \"lodash\",\n      \"version\": \"4.17.21\",\n      \"hashes\": [\n        {\n          \"alg\": \"SHA-512\",\n          \"content\": \"bf690311ee7b95e713ba568322e3533f2dd1cb880b189e99d4edef13592b81764daec43e2c54c61d5c558dc5cfb35ecb85b65519e74026ff17675b6f8f916f4a\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### SPDX Example\n```json\n{\n  \"spdxVersion\": \"SPDX-2.3\",\n  \"packages\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"lodash\",\n      \"SPDXID\": \"SPDXRef-Package-lodash-4.17.21\",\n      \"checksums\": [\n        {\n          \"algorithm\": \"SHA512\",\n          \"checksumValue\": \"bf690311ee7b95e713ba568322e3533f2dd1cb880b189e99d4edef13592b81764daec43e2c54c61d5c558dc5cfb35ecb85b65519e74026ff17675b6f8f916f4a\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Discussed in https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy/discussions/9082\n",

Add a standalone text link inside a link item\n2. See the broken alignment of the three-dot menu button\n3. Opne three-dot menu and select 'preview'\n4.

Instead of only considering bindings for attribute assignments, we need to consider both bindings and declarations. Declarations are already correctly recorded in the semantic index, but in type inference, we currently only access the bindings. The patch below may be useful as a reference to see which places in the source code need to change. It switches everything from bindings-only to declarations-only (which would fix the issue here), but of course that needs to be extended to consider both.\n\nJust like when resolving references to normal variables, declarations should take precedence over bindings. That is, even if we see conflicting definitions such as `self.x: int` and `self.x = \"a string\"`, the type of the `x` attribute should just be `int`.\n\n<details>\n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/semantic_index.rs b/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/semantic_index.rs\nindex d4f848e69d..9be2b157d7 100644\n--- a/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/semantic_index.rs\n+++ b/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/semantic_index.rs\n@@ -108,7 +108,7 @@ pub(crate) fn attribute_assignments<'db, 's>(\n     db: &'db dyn Db,\n     class_body_scope: ScopeId<'db>,\n     name: &'s str,\n-) -> impl Iterator<Item = (BindingWithConstraintsIterator<'db, 'db>, FileScopeId)> + use<'s, 'db> {\n+) -> impl Iterator<Item = (DeclarationsIterator<'db, 'db>, FileScopeId)> + use<'s, 'db> {\n     let file = class_body_scope.file(db);\n     let index = semantic_index(db, file);\n \n@@ -116,7 +116,7 @@ pub(crate) fn attribute_assignments<'db, 's>(\n         let place_table = index.place_table(function_scope_id);\n         let place = place_table.place_id_by_instance_attribute_name(name)?;\n         let use_def = &index.use_def_maps[function_scope_id];\n-        Some((use_def.public_bindings(place), function_scope_id))\n+        Some((use_def.public_declarations(place), function_scope_id))\n     })\n }\n \ndiff --git a/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/semantic_index/use_def.rs b/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/semantic_index/use_def.rs\nindex 8ac7f91811..978ce2de7a 100644\n--- a/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/semantic_index/use_def.rs\n+++ b/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/semantic_index/use_def.rs\n@@ -463,10 +463,10 @@ impl<'db> UseDefMap<'db> {\n             .is_always_false()\n     }\n \n-    pub(crate) fn is_binding_reachable(\n+    pub(crate) fn is_declaration_reachable(\n         &self,\n         db: &dyn crate::Db,\n-        binding: &BindingWithConstraints<'_, 'db>,\n+        binding: &DeclarationWithConstraint<'db>,\n     ) -> Truthiness {\n         self.reachability_constraints.evaluate(\n             db,\ndiff --git a/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/types/class.rs b/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/types/class.rs\nindex 3cd7bffa5b..371291a94a 100644\n--- a/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/types/class.rs\n+++ b/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/types/class.rs\n@@ -1744,10 +1744,10 @@ impl<'db> ClassLiteral<'db> {\n                     let method = index.expect_single_definition(method_def);\n                     let method_place = class_table.place_id_by_name(&method_def.name).unwrap();\n                     class_map\n-                        .public_bindings(method_place)\n-                        .find_map(|bind| {\n-                            (bind.binding.is_defined_and(|def| def == method))\n-                                .then(|| class_map.is_binding_reachable(db, &bind))\n+                        .public_declarations(method_place)\n+                        .find_map(|decl| {\n+                            (decl.declaration.is_defined_and(|def| def == method))\n+                                .then(|| class_map.is_declaration_reachable(db, &decl))\n                         })\n                         .unwrap_or(Truthiness::AlwaysFalse)\n                 } else {\n@@ -1762,7 +1762,7 @@ impl<'db> ClassLiteral<'db> {\n             let mut unbound_binding = None;\n \n             for attribute_assignment in attribute_assignments {\n-                if let DefinitionState::Undefined = attribute_assignment.binding {\n+                if let DefinitionState::Undefined = attribute_assignment.declaration {\n                     // Store the implicit unbound binding here so that we can delay the\n                     // computation of `unbound_reachability` to the point when we actually\n                     // need it.

      "description" : "Part of #12048\n\n## Issue\nAfter most of the Unit Test migration in #12048, there are a lot of inconsistencies in access control test methods. This is because we did not migrate the many convenient, abstracted, and commonly used access control test methods from `ui/webapi/BaseActionTest.java` to `sqlui/webapi/BaseActionTest.java`.\n\nAfter merging #13254, all of the access control test methods in `BaseActionTest.java` have been migrated. Hence, this issue aims to refactor the unit test access controls to use these convenient test methods.\n\n## Progress\nThe progress for this refactoring can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IcB-viJMrIOknYoBYasBuRBK9qnwY0-doEK4_Eb24IA/edit?gid=0#gid=0). I (the author) will update it when completed PRs are merged proactively.\n\n## Steps to Contribute\n\n1. Choose test(s) to work on in the above Google Sheets link\n2. Check that no on else have claimed the test cases to work on within the last 2 weeks, or that it has been completed by follow up PRs (but not updated in the sheets)\n3. Comment on this issue to indicate that you'd like to contribute on the chosen test(s). Update your comment if you need more than 2 weeks so that other contributors don't overlap with your work.\n4. Create a PR to refactor the unit test(s).\n5. Submit the PR, with a link to this issue by starting the description with \"Part of #13304\"## Tips\n\n- Understand the access control test methods in `sqlui/webapi/BaseActionTest.java`, follow the refactoring in #13254\n- Most of the access control testing logic in the migrated unit tests under `sqlui/webapi` follows the old unit tests under `ui/webapi`, so you may wish to reference the old unit test for help",

The contribution consists of number of activity performed on each tasks, meaning the lock and unlock of tasks or update of tasks status. \n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n\n1. Go to 'project details page'\n2. Click on 'view submissions'\n3. Scroll down to 'total contribution table'\n4. See error\n\n**Expected behavior**\nModify the total contributors table to show number of submissions per user including new features submissions. \n\n**Alternative solution**\nAdd an info icon to clarify users that the table consists of number of activity performed on each tasks that is stored on task history table and maynot match with number of submissions user has sent.\n\n**Screenshots**\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f788ab1-b16c-4f3b-82c0-b80830c488fd)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f22d2418-fbfc-46a7-a879-a02132e96714)\n\n**Additional context**\nThis confusion was raised by KU field mapathon. \n",

      "description" : "### Steps to reproduce\n\nUse the code below or try dartpad:\n[https://dartpad.dev/?id=06c010125e651e2bfadeecbff2db181a](https://dartpad.dev/?id=06c010125e651e2bfadeecbff2db181a)\nI tested it on the main branch and on the stable one.\n\n### Expected results\n\n`PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber` should return actual frame number on the Web, just like on other platforms.\n\n### Actual results\n\nOn the web `PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber` returns always -1.\nI have tested the code below on the desktop (Windows) and it returns the correct ascending frame numbers. But on the web (via `flutter run -d chrome` or dartpad) this method always returns -1.\nI also found two strange behaviors (potential bugs?).\n1. `frameNumber` has the old value until the end of the transientCallbacks phase. If this is not a bug, it should be documented. The picture below shows a different number in different callbacks during a frame. (underlined in blue)\n2.  `scheduleMicrotask` method calls its callback after the frame ends on the web, and not between `onBeginFrame` and `onDrawFrame` as expected (underlined in red). On the desktop (Windows) it works correctly.\n\n### Code sample\n\n<details open><summary>Code sample</summary>\n\n```dart\nimport 'dart:async';\nimport 'dart:ui';\n\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:flutter/scheduler.dart' show SchedulerBinding, Ticker;\n\nvoid main() {\n  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();\n\n  // ignore: invalid_use_of_protected_member\n  SchedulerBinding.instance.ensureFrameCallbacksRegistered();\n\n  final onBeginFrame = PlatformDispatcher.instance.onBeginFrame;\n  final onDrawFrame = PlatformDispatcher.instance.onDrawFrame;\n\n  PlatformDispatcher.instance.onBeginFrame = (Duration elapsed) {\n    print('+' * 30);\n    final frameNumber = PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber;\n    print('frameNumber from onBeginFrame callback: $frameNumber');\n    onBeginFrame!(elapsed);\n    print('___finish onBeginFrame');\n  };\n\n  PlatformDispatcher.instance.onDrawFrame = () {\n    print('___start onDrawFrame');\n    onDrawFrame!();\n    final frameNumber = PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber;\n    print('frameNumber from onDrawFrame callback: $frameNumber');\n    print('-' * 30);\n  };\n\n  runApp(const App());\n}\n\nclass App extends StatelessWidget {\n  const App({super.key});\n\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return const MaterialApp(debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false, home: Home());\n  }\n}\n\nclass Home extends StatefulWidget {\n  const Home({super.key});\n\n  @override\n  State<Home> createState() => _HomeState();\n}\n\nclass _HomeState extends State<Home> with TickerProviderStateMixin {\n  Ticker? ticker;\n\n  @override\n  void initState() {\n    super.initState();\n\n    SchedulerBinding.instance.addPersistentFrameCallback((_) {\n      final frameNumber = PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber;\n      print('frameNumber from the persistent callback: $frameNumber');\n    });\n\n    ticker = createTicker((_) {\n      final frameNumber = PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber;\n      print('frameNumber from the transient callback: $frameNumber');\n      scheduleMicrotask(() {\n        final frameNumber = PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber;\n        print('frameNumber from the microtask callback: $frameNumber');\n      });\n      SchedulerBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback((_) {\n        final frameNumber = PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber;\n        print('frameNumber from the postframe callback: $frameNumber');\n      });\n    })..start();\n\n    Timer(const Duration(seconds: 1), () {\n      ticker?.dispose();\n      ticker = null;\n    });\n  }\n\n  @override\n  void dispose() {\n    ticker?.dispose();\n    super.dispose();\n  }\n\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return const Placeholder();\n  }\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Screenshots or Video\n\n<details open>\n<summary>Screenshots / Video demonstration</summary>\n\nOn the desktop:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abca8f1d-4d88-4d5a-988e-974c58d0052e)\n\nOn the web:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fcfb6c2-ea1e-4c92-b62f-d7a800e01791)\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Logs\n\n\n\n\n### Flutter Doctor output\n\n<details open><summary>Doctor output</summary>\n\n```console\n[√] Flutter (Channel main, 3.33.0-1.0.pre.619, on Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.19045.5965], locale ru-RU)\n[√] Windows Version (Њ ©Єа®б®дв Windows 10 Pro 64-а §ап¤­ п, 22H2, 2009)\n[√] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 34.0.0)\n[√] Chrome - develop for the web\n[√] Visual Studio - develop Windows apps (Visual Studio Build Tools 2022 17.6.5)\n[√] Android Studio (version 2022.2)\n[√] VS Code (version 1.101.1)\n[√] Connected device (4 available)\n[√] Network resources\n\n• No issues found!\n```\n\n</details>\n",

This should be a fairly easy cleanup/replacement as well.\n- [ ] tricontourf\n- [ ] spy\n- [ ] scatterlines\n\nSome recipes may require some more refactoring, like breaking up an `onany` that updates multiple observables. They should still be fairly easy to translate (though I haven't checked in depth). `contourf` or `errorbars` might be an instructive example.\n- [ ] arrows\n- [ ] barplot\n- [ ] contour\n- [ ] triplot\n- [ ] waterfall\n- [ ] boxplot\n- [ ] crossbar\n- [ ] hexbin\n- [ ] violin\n\nSome recipes apply transformations and projections. These should probably be delayed a bit, as we can/should extend what's happening for primitive plots to recipe plots here\n- ~~hlines, vlines, hspan, vspan (+ limit tracking)~~\n- [ ] annotation (+ bbox handling)\n- [ ] bracket\n- [ ] streamplot (or maybe refactor rotation handling?)\n- [ ] textlabel\n- [ ] voronoiplot\n\nOther:\n- [ ] volumeslices (how do we want to handle the transformation system)\n\nNot sure if done:\n- [ ] axis3d (maybe needs full rework?)\n- [ ] datashader\n- [ ] rainclouds",

      "description" : "# GPU Support for the Ersilia Model Hub\n\n## Background\n\nCurrently, the Ersilia Model Hub does not support GPU acceleration, which limits the performance of some models — and makes others completely unusable. Models are currently packaged as CPU-only Docker images. The goal of this project is to evaluate and implement GPU support using Docker.\n\n## Goals\n\n- Demonstrate that a model can run inside a Docker container with GPU access.\n- Build the foundation to support GPU in the Ersilia infrastructure (template, CLI, metadata, CI/CD).\n- Benchmark performance between CPU and GPU runs.\n\n## Step 1: Manual GPU Docker Test (Top-Down)\n\nWe will first verify that models can run in a GPU-enabled Docker container, without relying on Ersilia's internal infrastructure (e.g., CLI or model template).\n\n- [ ] Select two test models:\n  - [ ] One **GPU-only** model (TBD).\n  - [ ] One **GPU/CPU-compatible** model (suggested: FAISS-based).\n- [ ] Set up the new GPU workstation.\n- [ ] Choose and test an appropriate CUDA base image (e.g., `nvidia/cuda:...`).\n- [ ] Ensure image size is acceptable (<~4GB ideally).\n- [ ] Run tests on:\n  - [ ] At least two local GPU workstations.\n  - [ ] One cloud instance (e.g., AWS GPU instance).\n\n## Step 2: Integrate GPU Support into Ersilia Infrastructure\n\n### \uD83E\uDDF1 At the [Ersilia Template](https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos-template) level\n\n- [ ] How should `install.yml` indicate GPU requirements?\n- [ ] If model code differs between CPU/GPU, how should this be reflected in the `framework/`?\n\n### ⚙️ At the [Ersilia CLI](https://github.com/ersilia-os/ersilia) level\n\n- [ ] Add support for `--gpu` or `--cpu` flags in the `ersilia serve` command.\n- [ ] Decide whether GPU/CPU mode should be:\n  - Explicit (user-defined via flag), or\n  - Automatic (detect from hardware?)\n- [ ] Assess: Can one image support both CPU and GPU, or do we need separate ones?\n\n### \uD83D\uDCE6 At the [Ersilia Metadata](https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos5axz/blob/main/metadata.json) level\n\n- [ ] Add `runtime: GPU` / `CPU` or similar field.\n- [ ] Consider `requirements` or `compatibility` sections if needed.\n\n### \uD83D\uDC33 On [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/ersiliaos)\n\n- [ ] Should GPU-compatible images use a separate tag (e.g., `model:gpu`) or separate repo?\n- [ ] Define tagging convention early.\n\n## Step 3: GitHub Actions & CI Integration\n\nIn the [Ersilia Model Workflows](https://github.com/ersilia-os/ersilia-model-workflows):\n\n- [ ] Detect whether a model supports GPU.\n- [ ] Build and push a GPU-compatible Docker image (using `nvidia-docker`).\n- [ ] Ensure existing workflows are not broken.\n\nIn the [Ersilia CLI CI/CD](https://github.com/ersilia-os/ersilia):\n\n- [ ] Add at least one unit test to check GPU execution (on GitHub-hosted runners or self-hosted runner with GPU).\n\n## Step 4: Benchmarking & Validation\n\n- [ ] Run performance benchmarks:\n  - CPU vs GPU execution time.\n  - Memory consumption and constraints.\n- [ ] Record any limitations or environment-specific requirements.",

For example : \n\n```nvidia/cuda:12.9.0-runtime-ubuntu24.04```\n\nThis comes to ~ 2 GB/3 GB depending on the exact CUDA and Ubuntu Version being used. \n\nIdeally run automated tests/builds for different combinations of Ubuntu (or other distributions?) and CUDA  versions. \n\n## CPU vs GPU preliminary testing\n\nA very simple test on TabPFN using a [Sci-Kit Learn Breast Cancer Dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html) showed approximately 3x-4x speed ups when GPU access to the process was enabled, compared to CPU only runs (on the Norrsken GPU Workstation).\n\nMore detailed tests using a [Dataset of approximately 2 Million Compounds](https://github.com/ersilia-os/sars-cov-2-chemspace/blob/main/data/reference_library_inchikeys.csv) showed overwhelming speed-ups with GPU Accelerated similarity searches using [FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss), the difference between search times of GPU and CPU implementations scaled/diverged with the Index size. **It is clearly worth trying to accelerate models using GPU Acceleration.**\n\nWe built indices out of Count Fingerprints of the compounds (converted the SMILES to 2048 Vectors). Cosine Similarity was used as a metric. \n\nFAISS does not support cosine by default, so we use  an `Inner Product` index and perform L2 (Euclidean) Normalisation on the vectors before adding to them to the index (or before searching), which is the equivalent of using Cosine similarity.\n\nTests were ran with index sizes of `10,000`, `100,000`, `500,000` and `1,000,000`. Nearest 100 Neighbours. \n\n### Index size 100,000:\n| Number of Searches | CPU (s) | GPU (s) |\n|--------------------|---------|---------|\n| 100                | 1       | 0.01    |\n| 1,000              | 7.08    | 0.04    |\n| 10,000             | 67.49   | 0.11    |\n| 100,000            | >350    | 1.30    |\n| 500,000            | -       | 5.50    |\n\n### Index size 1,000,000\n\n| Number of Searches | CPU (s) | GPU (s) |\n|--------------------|---------|---------|\n| 100                | 9.42    | 0.02    |\n| 1,000              | 71      | 0.10    |\n| 10,000             | 711     | 1.03    |\n| 100,000            | -       | 10.45   |\n| 500,000            | -       | 52.50   |\n\n\n\n### \n\n<img width=\"765\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e39adae0-7c06-43ba-ba5f-3da89037da02\" />\n\n_NOTE: GPUs are typically higher latency but have higher parallel throughput and memory bandwidth than CPUs. It is best to use batch queries with the CPU or GPU as this amortises the touching of index memory across all of the queries and this is when GPU speed ups are convenient. We will most likely not see any improvements in GPU search times with single queries (if anything it might be slower because of GPU overhead)._\n\n\nThe examples of inference time comparisons and a 3D plot (inference time against index and query sizes), clearly demonstrate **GPUs provide absolutely non-trivial speed ups for the right tasks.**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "# Very Heavy Index (FAISS Flat)\n\nFlat (IP and L2 for example) indices are extremely large (because FAISS only supports Float32 vectors, hence each Fingerprint vector is 32 * 2048 = 65,536 Bits or 4 * 2048=8,192  Bytes), scaling up to millions of vectors means we are dealing with indices that are 10s of GBs.\n\nTried FPSim2 but there are no benefits to GPU accelerating since it does not support batch queries (could be worth looking into CUDA Programming and tuning it to support batch queries, as it supports Sparse Vectors and Tanimoto Search on GPU)\n\n## Promising alternative to Flat FAISS Index: **Approximate Nearest Neighbour (ANN) search**\n\nMost methods for ANN require index training and parameter tuning which makes building the index more complex. We also need to ensure that the training sample is diverse. \n\nPlease note the difference between training and adding to Indices. And index cannot be trained incrementally but can be incrementally added to.\n\nMemory bottlenecks are also an issue so I first train the index and then add vectors to it incrementally in batches. (Although, it is suggested, If possible at all,  add more compute at index build time. (Especially if the index does not change a lot over time))\n\nThe following ANN methods are explored and suggested (compared to ~16 GB with a flat index of around 1.99 million Vectors)\n\n### **_IVFPQ (Inverted File Index with Product Quantisation):_** \n\n#### **_I am yet to do Accuracy tests on IVFPQ but with computational performance (inference time), models seem to enjoy GPU Acceleration speed ups similar to those mentioned above for FAISS Flat indices._**\n\nThis creates very light indices: `~93 MB for an index of around 1.99 Million Vectors`, but there might be a non-trivial loss of accuracy. \n\nNote: For some reason after the index is trained and incrementally built, FAISS takes a lot of time to write it to disk which makes it look like the process is frozen but isn't actually frozen - it goes into an \"uninterruptible sleep\" because of Disk IO, as indicated by the \"D\" state in htop. \n\n### **_HNSWSQ (Hierarchical Navigable Small World Index with Scalar Quantisation)_**\n\nTraining is reasonably fast (with GPU) but adding vectors is computationally intensive and needs to batched appropriately.\n\n#### **_I am yet to do Accuracy tests on HNSWSQ but with computational performance , HNSW seem to enjoy GPU Acceleration only with at Training time as indices are pretty compact and are VERY FAST with CPU and FAISS does not have a GPU search for this yet._**\n\nWhen choosing the strength of quantisation, there is a trade off between memory and accuracy:\n\nIndex of **1.99 million Vectors**:\n\n```\n4.63 GB (~2KB Per Vector + overhead) with a  8-Bit Quantiser while maintaining around 95-98% Accuracy^\n\n\n\n2.59 GB (~1.15KB Per Vector + overhead) with a 4-Bit Quantiser  while maintaining around 90-95% Accuracy^\n```\n\n\nAdding vectors to this kind of index is slow.\n\n_^accuracy according to official documentation and third party tests_\n", "# Metric Learning - Embedding Model\n\nAnother alternative to using vanilla flat indices with 2048 dimensional fingerprints we explore is the use of a metric learning model to create embeddings that are lower dimensions. We use these embeddings to create flat FAISS indices that are much lighter than the standard fingerprint indices (512, 256, 128, 100 dimensional embeddings vs 2048 dimensional fingerprints). We uses torch's GPU version and enjoy non-trivial speed-ups at training time, while creating embeddings and inference time (FAISS Search using a GPU index).\n\nNote: The searches are performed on a flat index, hence are exact searches, but the using of the embedding model means there is an approximation.", "We are aiming to create compound similarity search models with 4 compound libraries:\n\n- ChemDiv (100k)\n- A representative of Enamine  (~9 million)\n- DrugBank (~11k)\n- COCONUT (should be between 500k and 1 Million)\n\nWe also create a _Metric Learning Embedding Model_ out of a [reference library of 2 million compounds.](https://github.com/ersilia-os/sars-cov-2-chemspace/blob/main/data/reference_library_inchikeys.csv).\n\nFor each of the above libraries the aim is to have 3 variants of indices:\n\n- _A flat IP index with L2 Normalisation_\n    - This is going to be very large for libraries with 500k+ compounds)\n\n- _A compressed IVFPQ IP index  with L2 normalisation (FAISS compression)_\n   - This creates very light indices but as mentioned above there is a loss of search accuracy\n\n- _A flat index created with embeddings from the above mentioned model._\n   - This is lets us create indices that are lighter than vanilla flat indices and also lets us have control and confidence over the accuracy of the search (given that we are confident in the embedding model, which is arguably simpler to benchmark).\n \n", "Implemented a metric learning pipeline that creates learned embeddings from existing flat FAISS index. \n\n### Transforms 2048-dimensional fingerprints → _256/128/100-dimensional learned embeddings_ with cosine similarity\n\n### Triplet sampling: Uses existing 2M compound FAISS index for mining hard positives/negatives\n\nEvaluations: ROC-AUC, AP, distance distributions, t-SNE visualizations\n\nThe pipeline maintains L2 normalization throughout for FlatIP cosine similarity and includes model checkpointing + SMILES mapping for deployment.\n\nCreated with PyTorch + FAISS GPU.

Please describe.**\nStarting in `v7.10.0`, all subviews have a thin border/outline around them to make it easily distinguishable from other elements on the form. We have received feedback from some users that this is not always desirable, for instance when you have a subview within a larger subview, or when the headings clearly separate portions of the form. Some have mentioned they simply prefer the look without them and understand the implications of not clearly segmenting each table. \n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nOne of two solutions would be acceptable, with the first one being **preferred**.\n\n1. Allow users to configure subview outlines in the XML, setting them to `true` or `false` via an attribute (e.g. `outline`). The default would be `true`.\n\n2. Allow users to completely enable or disable subview outlines in User Preferences\n\n**Reported By**\nMarion at Museum für Naturkunde Berlin on the [Speciforum](https://discourse.specifysoftware.org/t/configureg-subview-border/2673)\n\n\n>For example, in my form, I have the Determiners subview in the Determination subview.

      "repositoryName" : "ONEARMY/community-platform",
      "description" : "> Do you have attention to detail and would like to work on making the UI nicer? This issue is then for you! :))\n\n## Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.\n1. Comment section is still not matching the designs. The whitespace is lacking between the nested comments and the visually it looks tight, packed and overwhelming.\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6340e9d-7671-4308-acd0-10bf42bffd4b)\n\n2. Additionally the comment on mobile has spacing from the left, leaving the space not being utilised and making the text unnecessarily squeezed.\n<img width=\"361\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28e206b7-fbe6-471c-a2c4-8f09b1284eeb\" />\n\nEspecially with nested comments it becomes obvious:\n<img width=\"361\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86610c32-e365-414c-868e-02621ca54564\" />\n\n3. If the comment has some enters for new line and the the Show more button shows, it creates an awkward space. There is also gap applied.\n<img width=\"918\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a76486ea-e490-4860-940e-c49498ebeb1e\" />\n\n## Describe the solution you'd like\n\nGenerally I think this will need not only adjusting the numbers, but some minor restructuring of the divs. So, let me try to number the improvements:\n\n---\n\n1. Improving the spacings between the nested comments. In the designs there are also the useful buttons in each comment, that are not yet implemented. In the design however, the spacing occurs naturally because of the useful buttons, so I did not need to add a big margin-bottom. I will leave the solution here up to you, but account for the fact that one day in the future we will introduce the useful button for the comment.\n<img width=\"670\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00f1a492-0cfe-4a26-a6d4-a25e9f1e81d2\" />\n\nDon't be afraid to be generous with the spacings, in the devtools i tried 50px as in my designs\n<img width=\"978\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f23db889-05ba-4607-bedc-25d4a4abc321\" />\n\n---\n\n2. Mobile improvement. Here I upload a gif of the solution that I utilised in the Figma designs - it was to hide the left column with the avatar, allowing the text to stretch and then showing the avatar next to the username in 30x30px size.\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/329f7267-8bdb-4d18-a47c-73b7e44d5478)\n\nDon't forget to make sure that the author's badge is working \n<img width=\"502\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b3012c1-567c-4e5e-b781-5f81852bbe28\" />\n\n\n---\n\n3. Putting the Show More button directly under the comment, trimming the whitespaces. \n<img width=\"947\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c07017f7-60f7-4c1c-92f4-859c1267736f\" />\n\n\n---\n\n4. Decreasing the gap here to 5px from 10px\n<img width=\"404\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a1c56f9-11f3-4bd0-9e52-239948b15c2f\" />\n\n\n\n---\n\n5. As you can see, on mobile it gets quite tight. I would suggest removing the word Published from the \"Published x time ago\" information for the comments.\n<img width=\"322\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe06174a-b402-452b-a18b-eefd38b03192\" />\n\n\n---\n\n6. OPTIONAL - In case you would want to act on the point 5. above even more, I would suggest for mobile screens shortening the formulation even more, saying for example 1h ago, 3mo ago or 2yr ago. Reddit does it this way as well.\n\n<img width=\"182\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c194f4c-a4ee-42a1-9c59-dcd5c6b77e42\" />\n\n---\n\n7. OPTIONAL - In case you would still be up for a challenge, having these 2 aligned on the baseline would be a nice achievement, however I didn't manage to get the desired result, since as you can see below, the align-items:baseline does not align them.\n<img width=\"742\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27968c77-de84-400a-8d3f-22e88b37b627\" />\n\n\n\n##  Additional context - [FIGMA FILE HERE](https://www.figma.com/design/XYV3fr8UVOdkNyBmKHHR7f/CP---Comments-Useful---Mobile?node-id=48-79)\nYou can find the figma file above. You can see the components, the desktop and the mobile versions. These design include the correct answer feature or the useful buttons, which are not yet implemented, so feel free to ignore those.\n\n<img width=\"761\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/119c7345-44cf-4baa-9ef6-feed6a05d7ad\" />\n\nIf you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask. :))",

I'd be happy to include that as well.", "Heyy @JCSergent! Cool to see that you are up for tackling these design improvements. \n\nJust yesterday we were talking with Ben, that this issue was in his opinion hard to follow and that the screenshots I included could be a bit confusing (some of them with the useful button, some without), so I thought about rewriting it. Is the issue clear to you though? If so, than let's keep it and if you find anything even slightly unclear you can tag me in the comments at any time and I'll be happy to give more clarification. :))\n\nAlso Ben mentioned that he does not have the capacity to prioritise this at the moment, so this would actually be really really helpful and valuable contribution from you. <3\n\nBen was also wrote yesterday that some of the points I mentioned were implemented already. After checking, it was only the point 5. - removing the word \"Published\" from the timestamp.\n\nI will ask the team about implementing the useful counter and let you know. :))", "@dalibormrska  - I think I understand it, but here let me try to summarize and let me know if I am understanding your requests correctly.\n\n\nRequest 1: Increase spacing between the nested comments.\nSolutions:\n- Long Term Solution: Add the Useful Counter to comments which will naturally add whitespace between the comments\n- Easier Solution: Manually add whitespace between the nested comments (which is the space the Useful Counter will take up later)\n\nRequest 2: When viewing comments (especially reply comments) in mobile, the comment text is extremely narrow.\nSolution: Remove the left side margin (make the comment text and profile image be on the same vertical line). Use the smaller version of the profile picture. Basically try to get to this design:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4045704-088e-4a7c-a7ff-bf3d1c5535b3)\n\nRequest 3: If a comment has alot of line breaks, there could be an awkward gap between the comment text and the 'Show more' button\nSolution: Remove line breaks from the end of the comment when hiding the rest of the comment behind the 'Show more' button\n\nRequest 4: Decrease Gap between profile/upload date line and comment body from 10px to 5px\nSolution: This is straight forward :), just decrease gap from 10px to 5px\n\nRequest 5: Remove the 'Published ... time ago' part of the upload date to save space\nSolution: Already Done :)\n\nRequest 6 (OPTIONAL): The upload date still takes alot of space on mobile\nSolution: Use time short hand in mobile. For example, use '5h ago' instead of '5 hours ago' or '4mo ago' instead of '4 months ago'\n\nRequest 7 (OPTIONAL): The user flag, user name, and upload date are not aligned\nSolution: Align the 3 on the baseline", "Cool, well summarised, it's pretty much spot-on. :)) \n\nThe only thing that got trickier since then is the Request 4. If you run the project locally or are a beta-tester, you will see that now the three-dots menu next to the top-comment has been implemented. The three-dots button is huge however, which makes the whole header of the top-comment taller than the replies and therefore makes it hard to achieve consistent gap.\n\nI don't know however what makes the most sense from the coding best practices - but I imagine if you tackle the Request 2. and include the avatar image in the comment header, then the whole header will get the height of the image. I would then suggest trying to make the image size and the three-dots menu size the same - let's try 35x35px and adjusting the gap accordingly.\n\n<img width=\"747\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be0d2dc1-70f8-41db-b36a-7eda73e85eb2\" />\n\nOther than that we just wait for @benfurber to assign. :))", "I'm sceptical of making the avatar too small, otherwise what's the point of showing it.\n\nIt's yours @JCSergent.\n\nOne thing to note, I'm about to implement some icon changes which includes the pointing down arrow in these screenshots." ],

The other columns sort in the expected order based on the sort type.\n\nAs part of this we should take stock of other sortable demos/examples to ensure they're sorting correctly as expected (ignoring columns that don't utilize text, i.e. a \"favorites\" column that only has a star icon button; this will be handled by https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/issues/11006)\n\n**Is this request originating from a Red Hat product team?

Although you say it didn’t work, were there any techniques that says it detected? \n\nIn the meantime, I’ll try to find something that could be used as a detection in UTM-VM, but there’s no guarantees. It’s a hard process and the codebase for that project is huge.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that MacOS techniques aren’t our speciality. Although we support it, we don’t really maintain it as Linux and Windows are the most demanded platforms for this sort of project.", "@kernelwernel Thanks for the response, \n\n\nBut I think I have found the solution for that, I have added one more check for detection of Hypervisor in MAC and it helped me.\n\n`sysctl kern.hv_vmm_present` \n\nit helped me to detect UTM.", "@AdnanAhad That’s incredibly useful to know, thanks! What does that command output for UTM exactly? I’d like to know so I can add an official new technique to the library. Credit will also be given obviously :)" ],

While I don't have a fix yet, we've previously encountered a very similar issue before (https://github.com/kernelwernel/VMAware/issues/359) and all we've done to fix it was by detecting binary translation environments and blacklisting (if found) for those specific techniques, and I'm pretty sure this is the path we'll take but I need to consult with my co-dev (@NotRequiem) who manages these techniques. I assume he's sleeping at the moment, but I'll let him know about the issue.\n\n> You can see in that all hypervisor registers are all zeroes.\n\nThat technique isn't really relevant in this scenario, it's relatively common to have that output.\n\n> I know that a normal hypervisor will return a bendstring when calling CPUID EAX=0x40000000. However, it is a bit strange to see that it is detected as a VM even though it is all 0.\n\nI assume you meant \"brand string\" instead of bendstring, but this is also not surprising since it's a binary translator. I *assume* you have Microsoft PRISM doing the x86 to ARM translation, which isn't really accurate to call it an emulator in itself but that's besides the point.\n\nA lot of funky stuff happens when the binary is being translated to a different ISA, but we still do our best to keep it as compatible as possible with the same core mechanisms we've done for real x86 hardware.

A simple x seconds delay configurable from the yaml file would allow users to slow down crawls.\r\n\r\nThis is similar to https://github.com/elastic/crawler/issues/46 (abiding by `Crawl-delay` in robots.txt). However, a general delay would be useful for users who can't or don't want to change the robots.txt.\r\n\r\nWhen both are implemented, the highest value of the two should be used for the crawl delay.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Solution\r\n\r\nAdd a configurable crawl delay in yaml file.\r\n\r\n### Additional Context\r\n\r\nLink to discuss forum: https://discuss.elastic.co/t/apply-delay-between-requests-in-elastic-crawler/361375/4\r\n",

Write a brief description of how you will approach the task (without using ChatGPT).\n3. Add your Telegram handler in your application (e.g., in OnlyDust or similar)\n4. Write ETA in your application\n\n\n\n## What should I do if I have a problem\n1. Try to google it before asking. Googling is taking major part of dev work \n2. If you couldn't find answer your question with Google, text your question to [dev](https://t.me/spotnet_dev/4) group with your question.\n3. Do not send DM to maintainer, it would be better and faster to ask other contributors in chat \n\n\n## How to prepare PR\n1. Check if your code [smell](https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/smells) good\n2.  Add `close #<issue number>` to link your issue with your PR\n3.  Do not commit changes which is not related to your task \n4. Check after you created PR, if you committed everything.\n\n## Task description  \n1. Create a `POST /signup` endpoint that accepts only the user's email in the request body:\n```json\n{\n  \"email\": \"user@example.com\"\n}\n```\n\n2. Check if the email already exists in the database (e.g. pre-created by a super admin).\n3. If valid, generate a JWT token that encodes the email.\n4.

This is great.\n\nI've noticed in my own experimentation, plus reviewing these PRs, that my biggest concern is that we just don't have enough tests. A lot of code is untouched by the test suite. Codecov is not the perfect tool here, because it has a little trouble parsing fypp -> f90, so it marks some lines as not covered that are actually covered. Still, there are things like the output files, the probes, data transfer between simulation -> post_process, and so on. \n\nThe code is not so hard to refactor, but there are some areas that are concerning. I suspect that #914 is a side effect of me or someone else's PR (I could be wrong). This case simply wasn't tested in CI appropriately.\n\nThere is a tango required to get decent tests without overfitting to specific computers or spending 10 hours in CI running (plus another 10 hours queuing in some cases). But I would rather have good tests so we can more confidently refactor and add features than be cavalier about merging quite important changes into the code. \n\nAn example is #907 from @XZTian64 or #855 (and similar) from @Malmahrouqi3 and #901 from me. I'm not fully confident that nothing will go wrong in merging these, despite the tests. The ones that involve writing probes or post_process are most concerning at the moment, I think." ],

I'm not sure if a diff is the best way to go or not (presumably that would go into benchmarking since it would have to be PR vs. Master). \n\nThe easiest way to get a merge in, that could possibly be migrated to benchmarking later, would be to just run the nsys command with appropriate flags, and it will tell you what the most expensive subroutines are. We have some documentation on nsight profiling in the MFC docs `./mfc.sh run <...> --profile` should work I think. But I think that will just create a report file you look at in the GUI.

Write a brief description of how you will approach the task (without using ChatGPT).\n3. Add your Telegram handler in your application (e.g., in OnlyDust or similar)\n4. Write ETA in your application\n\n\n\n## What should I do if I have a problem\n1. Try to google it before asking. Googling is taking major part of dev work \n2. If you couldn't find answer your question with Google, text your question to [dev](https://t.me/spotnet_dev/4) group with your question.\n3. Do not send DM to maintainer, it would be better and faster to ask other contributors in chat \n\n\n## How to prepare PR\n1. Check if your code [smell](https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/smells) good\n2. Add `close #<issue number>` to link your issue with your PR\n3. Do not commit changes that are unrelated to your task\n4. Check after you created PR, if you committed everything\n\n\n## Task Description\n1. In the [handlers folder](./blob/main/margin/margin_app/app/telegram/handlers), create a new file named `admin.py`. Inside, add a handler called `/assets`. Use the [`Admin Filter` from this issue](https://github.com/djeck1432/spotnet/issues/915) to verify the user is an admin. Then, call the [`Assets statistic` method from this issue](https://github.com/djeck1432/spotnet/issues/906) to retrieve the data. Format the response using Telegram Markdown so it displays neatly.\n2. Provide a screenshot demonstrating that the handler works as expected.\n",

It makes sense for DagRun with multiple versions, but I don't think we should be able to explore DagVersions that are not part of the selected dagrun at all. \n\nIt makes it hard to follow when we start playing with the `version selector` when a DagRun is selected.

Please DO NOT use the issue tracker to ask questions.\n\nDocumentation issues should be posted to https://github.com/jreleaser/jreleaser.github.io/issues\n\n-->\n\n### Task List\n\n- [x] Steps to reproduce provided\n- [x] Stacktrace (if present) provided\n- [ ] Example that reproduces the problem (link to git repository is ideal)\n- [x] Full description of the issue provided (see below)\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nI have a directory containing a set of artifacts to be deployed (the directory is laid out in the standard Maven repository layout). The directory includes artifacts that meet the CR requirements, along with PGP signatures for every file. I'm fairly sure, given the actual error below, that the artifacts themselves don't matter.\n\nI have the following `jreleaser.toml`:\n\n```\n[deploy.maven.mavenCentral.sonatype]\nactive = \"ALWAYS\"\nsign = false\nurl = \"https://central.sonatype.com/api/v1/publisher\"\nstagingRepositories = [\"build/maven\"]\n```\n\nI run jreleaser:\n\n```\n$ env \\\nJRELEASER_MAVENCENTRAL_USERNAME=\"${MAVEN_CENTRAL_USERNAME}\" \\\nJRELEASER_MAVENCENTRAL_PASSWORD=\"${MAVEN_CENTRAL_PASSWORD}\" \\\nJRELEASER_PROJECT_JAVA_GROUP_ID=\"${JRELEASER_PROJECT_JAVA_GROUP_ID}\" \\\nJRELEASER_PROJECT_VERSION=\"${JRELEASER_PROJECT_VERSION}\" \\\n./jreleaser deploy --config-file=jreleaser.toml\n```\n\n### Expected Behaviour\n\nI'd expect to see `jreleaser` create a bundle and deploy it to Maven Central.\n\n### Actual Behaviour\n\n```\n[INFO]  JReleaser

While it is not explicitly stored in the footer, it can be estimated by analyzing the number of pages via the `OrdinalIndex` and calculating the average page size.  \n\nIt might be worthwhile to include a few functions for inspecting a column's metadata.\n\nFurther more, we can also consider add these column stats into the optimizer statistics system, stored in the `_statistics_.column_statistics` table.\n\n",

      "description" : "# Fork, Commit, Merge - Medium Issue 2 (React.js)\r\n\r\n## Create a Traffic Light Component\r\n*Note: You don't have ask permission to start solving the issue or get assigned, since these issues are supposed to be always open for new contributors. The actions-user bot will reset the file back to previous state for the next contributor after your commit is merged. So you can just simply start working with the issue right away!*\r\n\r\n### How to get started:\r\n\r\nStart by navigating inside of the directory used in this project with the command:\r\n```bash\r\ncd tasks/react/medium/traffic-light\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen run `npm i` to install Vite, React and all the necessary dependencies for the project.\r\n\r\nAfter installing the dependencies you can open the `src` directory and the `TrafficLight.tsx` file, and start implementing your solution!\r\n\r\n![react-medium](https://github.com/fork-commit-merge/fork-commit-merge/assets/82566656/e154750d-41fd-4db4-bcc6-9dd52c7e55d6)\r\n\r\n### Description:\r\n\r\nCreate a React component using TypeScript that simulates a traffic light. The component should display three lights (red, yellow, and green) and switch between them automatically in the order of a typical traffic light sequence.\r\n\r\n### Requirements:\r\n\r\n-   Implement a `TrafficLight` component in `src/TrafficLight.tsx`.\r\n-   Use TypeScript for type safety.\r\n-   The component should render three circles, colored red, yellow, and green.\r\n-   The traffic light should start with the red light.\r\n-   After a few seconds, it should change to green, then yellow, and then back to red in a continuous loop.\r\n-   Only one light should be \"active\" (brighter) at a time.\r\n\r\nThere are some CSS classes already added for you in the `src/App.css` file, which you can use if you like, or write your own custom CSS.\r\nThere is for example a helper pseudo-class selector for every light that is not active, which will set the light color to gray if the light does not have the `active` class:\r\n\r\n![react-medium-css](https://github.com/fork-commit-merge/fork-commit-merge/assets/82566656/052aaf61-e4d9-40b9-8876-bf96aa2ada9c)\r\n\r\n### Example:\r\n\r\nThe traffic light should cycle as follows:\r\n\r\n-   Red (active) for 4 seconds.\r\n-   Green (active) for 3 seconds.\r\n-   Yellow (active) for 1 second.\r\n-   Repeat the cycle.\r\n\r\n## How to run:\r\nAfter you are done with the card, make sure you are in the `tasks/react/medium/traffic-light` in your terminal and run `npm run dev` to start the Vite server. Then, open \"http://localhost:5173/\" in your browser to check how the app looks.\r\n\r\nIf it looks to be working fine, you are ready to make a pull request!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo work with this issue, you need to have npm and NodeJS installed to your local machine.\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions of installing npm and NodeJS as well as how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Why use Vite?\r\n\r\nThis React project uses Vite for near-instant server start-ups and incredibly fast hot module replacements, providing a smooth and efficient development experience.\r\nAlso Vite requires minimal setup, allowing us to focus on writing React code without getting bogged down in complex configurations.\r\nIf you want to learn more about Vite, check out the documentation:\r\n[Vite Official Documentation](https://vitejs.dev/)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

      "repositoryName" : "dotnet/aspnetcore",
      "description" : "## Summary\n\nAdd a ```blob([mimeType: string])``` method to ```DotNetStreamReference``` in Blazor, allowing developers to obtain a Blob from a .NET stream in JavaScript, without fully loading the stream into memory. We chose this specific issue, because it is a \"good-first-issue\" and we are participating in a germany wide competition, where the subject is to work on issues in open source projects. \nLink to issue: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/47685\n\n## Motivation and goals\n\nBlazor developers can currently pass .NET streams to JavaScript using ```DotNetStreamReference```, which exposes two main methods:\n- ```stream()``` (returns a ReadableStream)\n- ```arrayBuffer()``` (loads the full stream into memory)\n\nThe problem:\n- There is no direct way to obtain a Blob, which is required for many web APIs (like ```<video>``` elements, file downloads or drag-and-drop functionality).\n- ```arrayBuffer()``` is not suitable for large files (like videos) because it fully buffers the stream in memory before use.\n- Using ```stream()``` gives a ReadableStream, but many APIs (like ```<video src=...>```, ```URL.createObjectURL()```) require a Blob, not a stream, and converting a ReadableStream into a Blob in JS is non-trivial and inefficient.\n\nAdding a ```blob()``` method would:\n- Allow efficient handling of large files (like video or audio) without consuming excessive memory.\n- Simplify developer workflows by aligning with common web APIs that expect a Blob.\n- Close a usability gap in the current Blazor-JS interop system.\n\n## In scope\n\n- A new method ```blob([mimeType: string])``` on ```DotNetStreamReference``` that returns a Blob representing the .NET stream.\n- Ensuring the Blob can be used with standard web APIs (e.g., ```<video>```, ```<audio>```, ```URL.createObjectURL()```).\n- Keeping performance and memory usage efficient for large streams.\n\n## Out of scope\n\n- Changes to the existing stream() or arrayBuffer() methods.\n- Polyfills for browsers that lack Blob support (modern browsers are assumed).\n- Enhancements to streaming APIs beyond providing the Blob.\n\n## Risks / unknowns\n- **Browser behavior**: While Blobs are widely supported, the implementation detail of\nstreaming data into a Blob without full buffering might depend on browser internals.\nSome browsers may still buffer the entire Blob in memory before making it available.\n\n- **Memory use**: Even if we avoid buffering in .NET or JS, the underlying browser may still\nend up consuming memory when the Blob is accessed, especially for very large files.\n\n- **Implementation complexity**: Creating a Blob from a .NET stream across JS interop\nmight require platform-level work to ensure true streaming behavior rather than just\nbuffering and converting.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Blazor usage example\n```blazor\n<video @ref=\"videoPlayer\" controls autoplay></video>\n\n<button @onclick=\"PlayVideo\">Play Streamed Video</button>\n\n@code {\n    private ElementReference videoPlayer;\n\n    private async Task PlayVideo()\n    {\n        using var fileStream = File.OpenRead(\"bigvideo.mp4\");\n        var streamRef = new DotNetStreamReference(fileStream);\n\n        // JS call to create a blob URL from the .NET stream\n        var videoUrl = await JS.InvokeAsync<string>(\"createVideoBlobUrl\", streamRef);\n\n        // Set the video source\n        await JS.InvokeVoidAsync(\"setVideoSrc\", videoPlayer, videoUrl);\n    }\n}\n```\n### JavaScript interop\n```JavaScript\nwindow.createVideoBlobUrl = async function (streamRef) {\n    const blob = await streamRef.blob(\"video/mp4\");\n    return URL.createObjectURL(blob);\n};\n\nwindow.setVideoSrc = function (videoElement, src) {\n    videoElement.src = src;\n};\n```\n",

The \"insider way to do this is to append `/#/ipfs-sw-config` to the subdomain URI which will load the config page. \n\n\n@SgtPooki and I discussed some ideas on how to solve this:\n- Add a query parameter to disable the config redirect\n- Removing the config redirect by default (also a minor perf win)\n- Using the IPFS Companion extension to detect the SW and either allowing config from there or a button linking you to the config hash fragment ", "for now I think the config redirect is a pretty good improvement while not adding much latency. It is also extremely useful for testing, tbh, but also some potential future privacy/security concerns. We can disable or adjust easily in the future once we get the config in companion or get more feedback that folks really don't care about the shared config at all." ],

      "description" : "# Background\nHi community,\n\nShardingSphere's parser engine enables users to parse SQL into AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) and convert it into SQLStatement objects. \nThis issue focuses on enhancing MySQL stored procedure parsing capabilities to support complex database programming logic.\n\nMore details:\nhttps://shardingsphere.apache.org/document/current/en/reference/sharding/parse/\n\n# Issue Background Explanation\n\nThese SQL statements are from the official MySQL test set. \nYou can find the corresponding stored procedure SQL statements in the following website: https://github.com/mysql/mysql-server/tree/8.0/mysql-test/t \nThese SQL cases are then passed to ShardingSphere's parsing engine for analysis. \nFor SQL cases that fail to be parsed successfully, every 3 to 5 SQL cases are grouped together as an issue.\n1. It cannot be guaranteed that all SQL cases are correct. Please follow the following process to handle this pull request (PR).\n2. Some SQL cases may have already been fixed in other PRs. For cases that can already be executed successfully, simply leave a comment to ignore them.\n3. If a SQL case can be executed successfully without any code changes, there is no need to add a corresponding test assert file.\n\n# Task\nThis issue requires adding support for the following MySQL stored procedure syntax:\n```sql\n-- The original file and line number of the sql: analyze:85 \nCREATE PROCEDURE p() ANALYZE TABLE v UPDATE HISTOGRAM ON w\n```\n\n```sql\n-- The original file and line number of the sql: change_user_deadlock:35 \nEND |\nCREATE PROCEDURE p_processlist()\nBEGIN\nDECLARE x INT DEFAULT 3000\n```\n\n```sql\n-- The original file and line number of the sql: change_user_deadlock:26 \nCREATE PROCEDURE p_flush_status()\nBEGIN\nDECLARE x INT DEFAULT 3000\n```\n\n```sql\n-- The original file and line number of the sql: clear_diag_area:254 \nCREATE PROCEDURE p7_show_warnings ()\nBEGIN\nSHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'foo';\nSHOW WARNINGS;\nSELECT \"(SHOW WARNINGS does not have to come last)\";\nEND\n```\n\n```sql\n-- The original file and line number of the sql: clear_diag_area:263 \nCREATE PROCEDURE p8b_show_warnings ()\nBEGIN\nSHOW WARNINGS;\nEND\n```\n\n\n# Overall Procedure\nIf you intend to participate in fixing this issue, please feel free to leave a comment below the issue. Community members will assign the issue accordingly.\nFor example, you can leave a comment like this: \"Hi, please assign this issue to me. Thank you!\"\n\nOnce you have claimed the issue, please review the syntax of the SQL on the official website of the corresponding database. \nExecute the SQL on the respective database to ensure the correctness of the SQL syntax.\n\nYou can check the corresponding source of each SQL case on the official database website.\nNext, execute the problematic SQL cases mentioned above in the database (you can quickly start the corresponding database using the Docker image for that database, and then connect to it using a client you are  familiar with), to ensure that the SQL syntax itself is correct.\n\n\nOnce you have confirmed the correctness of the SQL syntax, you can validate and fix the grammar parsing issue in ShardingSphere.\n>If you are using IntelliJ IDEA, you will need to install the ANTLR plugin before proceeding.\nIf it is an ANTLR parsing error message, try to repair the `.g4` file by comparing it with the official database syntax until the SQL can be correctly parsed by ANTLR.\nWhen there is no error message in the ANTLR Preview window, it means that ANTLR can correctly parse the SQL.\n\n\nAfter ANTLR parses SQL into an abstract syntax tree, ShardingSphere will access the abstract syntax tree through Visitor and extract the required information.\nIf you need to extract Segments, you need to first execute:\n```shell\nmvn -T 2C clean install -DskipTests\n```\nUnder the shardingsphere-parser module to compile the entire parser module.\nThen rewrite the corresponding visit method in SQLStatementVisitorr as needed to extract the corresponding Segment.\n\n\nAfter the above SQL parsing problem is repaired, the corresponding Test needs to be added.\nThe steps are as follows:\n1. Add the corresponding `sql-case` in the `sql/supported` directory.\n2. Add case assertions in the case directory of the `shardingsphere-test-it-parser` module.\n3. Run `org.apache.shardingsphere.test.it.sql.parser.internal.InternalSQLParserIT`\nAfter SQL Parser IT runs successfully, you can submit a PR.\n\n\n1. Master JAVA language\n2. Have a basic understanding of Antlr g4 file\n3. Be familiar with MySQL SQLs",

The actions-user bot will reset the file back to previous state for the next contributor after your commit is merged. So you can just simply start working with the issue right away!*\r\n\r\n## How to get started\r\n\r\nStart by opening the `tasks/python/medium` directory from the root of the project. \r\nThen open `bubble_sort.py` file and start working on your solution!\r\n\r\n![python-medium](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/assets/82566656/b32978ed-2a26-48d8-9bd4-322cf1916586)\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThe goal of this issue is to implement the bubble sort algorithm in Python. The function should be able to sort an array of integers in ascending order. You should create a function called `bubble_sort` to accomplish this.\r\n*Note: Do not use the `sort` function or any similar methods to solve this task.*\r\n\r\n## How to run\r\n\r\nMake sure you are in the right directory:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncd tasks/python/medium\r\n```\r\n\r\nExecute the following command to run your Python script:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npython bubble_sort.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected output\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nOriginal array: [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]\r\nSorted array: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the output looks correct, you are ready to make a pull request!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo work with this issue, you need to have Python installed to your local machine.\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions of installing Python and how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

Are there any additional considerations I should be aware of before I start working on a PR?", "UPDATE:\n\nStarting #386 - kubeflex changes its usage of kubeconfig extensions (see https://github.com/kubestellar/kubeflex/blob/main/docs/users.md#v090)\n\nIn kubeflex, extensions are easier to use thanks to our internal package https://github.com/kubestellar/kubeflex/tree/main/pkg/kubeconfig\n\nAs consequences, the key `kflex-initial-ctx-name` is outdated.

      "description" : "This is a top-level issue for tracking the manual porting of ethereum/tests test cases to execution-spec-tests:\r\n\r\n> **Contributions to manually port individual test cases are very welcome!**\r\n\r\n**If you're already familiar with ethereum/tests and execution-spec-tests, jump to the issue tracker below!**\r\n\r\n#### Background\r\n[ethereum/tests](https://github.com/ethereum/tests) was the repository used to define EVM test cases from [Frontier](https://ethereum.org/en/history/#frontier) up to and including [The Merge](https://ethereum.org/en/history/#paris). The test cases are defined as YAML (and sometimes JSON) files in the [./src/ sub-directory](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/tree/develop/src) and the JSON \"test fixtures\" (fully-populated tests that can be executed against clients) are generated using [ethereum/retesteth](https://github.com/ethereum/retesteth). These JSON artifacts are regenerated when required and added to the repository, for example, in the [./GeneralStateTests/ sub-directory](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/tree/develop/GeneralStateTests).\r\n\r\nFrom [Shanghai](https://ethereum.org/en/history/#shapella) on, new test cases (in particular for new features included in hard-forks) have been defined in Python in this repository (execution-spec-tests). The existing test cases are still important to execute against clients, however, and porting ethereum/tests to execution-spec-tests ensures that the test cases can be continually maintained and filled (generated) for newer forks. It also has the advantage that client teams will only need to obtain test fixture releases from one source.\r\n\r\n#### Automated Port to Python\r\nAlthough there will be an effort to automate (\"transpile\") the remaining test cases from YAML (respectively JSON) to Python; contributions to manually port individual test cases can be very beneficial and are welcome! \r\n\r\nThe benefits of manual porting are:\r\n1. Reduce the number of test cases by combing multiple YAML (resp. JSON) test cases in one Python test function (via parametrization).\r\n2. Potentially improve coverage by parametrizing the Python version.\r\n3. Code/docstrings are likely higher quality than an automated conversion.\r\n4. The test can be better [organized within the `./tests` folder](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-spec-tests/main/writing_tests/adding_a_new_test/) in execution-spec-tests by the fork and the EIP in which the functionality was introduced.\r\n\r\n#### Process\r\n1. Pick a single or a set of YAML test cases in ethereum/tests to port and create an issue in this repository - optional, but definitely recommended if porting tests from the tracker below to avoid duplicate work.\r\n2. Create a PR with the ported tests:\r\n    a. Add the list of ported YAML files to [converted-ethereum-tests.txt](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/blob/1b30c336eae6b0746ea4db441ac74406f2fb2322/converted-ethereum-tests.txt).\r\n    b. If the tests can't currently be filled, please explain the issue (feel free to also [open a Discussion](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/discussions/new?category=general)).\r\n\r\n#### Help with ethereum/tests\r\n\r\nThe test formats are described in the [ethereum/tests online docs](https://ethereum-tests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/blockchain-ref.html). Note that state filler test cases in YAML can be parametrized, see the [docs here](https://ethereum-tests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/test_filler/state_filler.html#the-indexes).\r\n\r\n#### Hints to Get Started with ethereum/execution-spec-tests\r\n\r\n0. Start here: [Getting Started → Installation](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-spec-tests/main/getting_started/installation/).\r\n1. Use `uv run et make test` to create a template test module (currently a WIP in #950).\r\n2. Where to put the test? See how tests are organized in [Writing Tests → Adding a New Test](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-spec-tests/main/writing_tests/adding_a_new_test/).\r\n3. State vs Blockchain test? If in doubt try to write a state test, see [Writing Tests → Types of Tests → Deciding on a Test Type](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-spec-tests/main/writing_tests/types_of_tests/#deciding-on-a-test-type).\r\n4. Tests are filled via EELS by default (no further installation necessary; it's a Python dependency and got installed in Step 0), see [Filling  → Getting Started](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-spec-tests/main/filling_tests/getting_started/).\r\n5. Parametrizing test functions is encouraged, see [Writing Tests → Writing a New Test → Parametrizing Tests](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-spec-tests/main/writing_tests/writing_a_new_test/#parametrizing-tests).\r\n6. The Opcode mini-lang defined in this repository is the preferred way to define bytecode in tests (if feasible).

The User Stories should follow this pattern:-->\r\nAs a app user I want know if at a poi my language is spoken so that I know if it is worth for me to go there.\r\n\r\n### Additional Context\r\n<!-- Add any other information or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\r\nSee: https://openproject.tuerantuer.org/projects/community-feedback/work_packages/3231/activity\r\n\r\n### Design Requirements\r\n<!-- If the customization includes input from our design team, the detailed requirements will be collected here.

      "description" : "**Describe the bug**\n\n\n**To Reproduce**\n\n1. Checkout and build [Camunda Example Twitter](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/camunda-8-examples/tree/main/twitter-review-java-springboot)\n\n2. Set appropriate configuration properties to connect to your cluster/instance\n```\nzeebe.client.cloud.clusterId=...\nzeebe.client.cloud.clientId=SJqG7ve....\nzeebe.client.cloud.clientSecret=...\nzeebe.client.cloud.region=...\nzeebe.client.cloud.auth-url=...\nzeebe.client.cloud.base-url=...\n```\n\n3. Set environment variable \n```\nZEEBE_CLIENT_CONFIG_PATH=/tmp\n```\n\n4. Run the application and see some errors on the console regarding authentication issues.\n\n```\nat io.camunda.zeebe.client.impl.ZeebeClientFutureImpl.join(ZeebeClientFutureImpl.java:52) ~[zeebe-client-java-8.6.7.jar:8.6.7]\n\t... 32 common frames omitted\nCaused by: io.grpc.StatusRuntimeException: UNAUTHENTICATED: HTTP status code 401\ninvalid content-type: text/html\nheaders: Metadata(:status=401,date=Fri, 24 Jan 2025 14:49:06 GMT,content-type=text/html,www-authenticate=Bearer token_type=\"JWT\",strict-transport-security=max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains,content-length=172)\nDATA-----------------------------\n<html>\n<head><title>401 Authorization Required</title></head>\n<body>\n<center><h1>401 Authorization Required</h1></center>\n<hr><center>nginx</center>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n**Expected behavior**\n\nFor a better developer experience, the client should at least log an error to the console. But ideally should abort the bootstrapping with a useful error message mentioning which property is wrongly configured.\n\n**Log/Stacktrace**\n\n\n\uD83D\uDC40 \n**We do indeed raise an exception, when a directory is configured instead of a file (see [here](https://github.com/camunda/camunda/blob/ed8a807969f040fdb55b575a9e31fef957fd8d5e/clients/java/src/main/java/io/camunda/zeebe/client/impl/oauth/OAuthCredentialsProviderBuilder.java#L251)) and\nthe exception bubbles up to `PropertyUtil.java` (see [here](https://github.com/camunda/camunda/blob/cbef3b18134bbd4198456c293206bef2eab726f9/clients/spring-boot-starter-camunda-sdk/src/main/java/io/camunda/zeebe/spring/client/configuration/PropertyUtil.java#L98)) where the error is logged with `DEBUG` level!**\n\uD83D\uDC40 \n\nThus in order to see the message on the console the log level of the spring application needs to be changed\n(You will still see a lot of noise on the log, because the client still continues to bootstrap)\n\n```\nlogging.level.root=DEBUG\n```\n\nSee stack trace and error message below.\n\n<details><summary>Full Stacktrace</summary>\n

By doing so:\n- We can reference this method without the compiler needing to know what type it is\n- We can ensure that this behaviour is guaranteed across vector stores.\n\nThis would also be a good chance to implement a new, different type of `insert_docs` method that also takes a user-defined ID generation strategy (although perhaps out of initial scope for the first PR).\n\n### Motivation\n<!--\nPlease describe the use case(s) or other motivation for the new feature.\n-->\nBetter UX, better type reusability.\n\n### Proposal\n<!--\nHow should the new feature be implemented, and why? Add any considered\ndrawbacks.\n-->\nMove all `insert_document` methods under a new `InsertDocuments` trait.\n\n### Alternatives\n<!--\nAre there other ways to solve this problem that you've considered?

This can result in a token length that exceeds the limits set by the system. Here are some steps you can take to address this issue:您在使用 Dify 中的 Volcengine 插件时遇到的 \"标记太长 \"错误可能与处理大数据输入（如转换为 base64 编码的图像）有关。这可能导致标记长度超出系统设置的限制。以下是解决此问题的一些步骤：\n> \n> 1. **Reduce Image Size**: Try reducing the size of the images before uploading them to Dify. This can help prevent the base64 encoded data from exceeding the token limit.**减小图片大小 **：在将图片上传到 Dify 之前，请尝试减小图片大小。这有助于防止 base64 编码数据超出令牌限制。\n> 2. **Check Token Limits**: Ensure that the token limits for your model and API requests are configured correctly. Dify imposes a generation length limit of 2k tokens for reasoning models, which might be relevant if your workflow involves such models [[1]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/17120).**检查令牌限制 **：确保正确配置模型和 API 请求的令牌限制。Dify 为推理模型规定了 2k 标记的生成长度限制，如果您的工作流涉及此类模型，则可能与此相关 [[1]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/17120) 。\n> 3. **Switch Model Provider**: If you're using the `openai_api_compatible` provider, consider switching to a different model provider that might handle larger token sizes more effectively [[2]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/18657).**切换模型提供程序 **：如果您正在使用 `openai_api_compatible` 提供程序，请考虑切换到不同的模型提供程序，这样可以更有效地处理更大的标记大小 [[2]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/18657) 。\n> 4. **Review Workflow Configuration**: Double-check your workflow configuration to ensure that all parameters and settings are optimized for handling the data sizes you're working with.**审查工作流程配置 **：仔细检查您的工作流程配置，确保所有参数和设置都经过优化，以处理您正在处理的数据大小。\n> \n> By implementing these suggestions, you should be able to mitigate the \"token too long\" error and improve the stability of your plugin operations.通过实施这些建议，您应该可以减少 \"标记太长 \"错误，并提高插件运行的稳定性。\n> \n> _To continue talking to [Dosu](https://dosu.dev), mention [@dosu](https://github.com/dosu).要继续与 [Dosu](https://dosu.dev) 通话，请提及 。_\n> \n> Help Dosu learn!

If unavailable (e.g., in development), default to `Cartography/dev`.\n\n**Benefits**:\n\n* Easier debugging and tracing of requests in API logs\n* Improves compatibility with vendors that expect or validate user-agents\n* Aligns with standard HTTP client practices\n\n**Suggested implementation**:\n\n* Introduce a small utility (e.g., `build_session()`) in `cartography.util` to initialize a `requests.Session` with the appropriate `User-Agent`\n* Refactor existing intel modules to use this session instead of directly instantiating `requests.Session()`",

Computing the full inverse matrix is computationally expensive and somewhat contradictory to the iterative sparse methods we’re testing.\n\nCould you suggest an alternative approach for `error_est`?\nFor example, I’m considering replacing it with a simpler, lightweight estimate such as:\n\n`error_est = {some num > 0}* n1 * n2`\n", "This is an error estimate based on the maximum absolute value of the inverse matrix. It could read in fact\n```python\nerror_est = np.linalg.norm(Bmat.flat, np.inf)\n```\nwhich is the inf-norm of the vectorized matrix. This does not seem to give a sharp estimate, given that it is multiplied by a small number just below (`tol = 1e-5`). Maybe @jowezarek could shed some light on this?", "@anushkasinghh @yguclu \nThanks for bringing this up, this code snipped is ridiculously complicated and doesn't do what it's supposed to do :')\n\nThe explicit matrix inverse was never truly needed, and yet there's no time to gain as the entire test ran in < 3 seconds on my machine.\n\nThis particular part of the test was designed to test whether power operations (**0, **1, **2) work with inverse linear operators (ILOs).\n\nThe poorly executed idea of the test was the following:\n```python\n# arbitrary tolerance\ntol = \n\n# Define 2-norm of vector using inner (as proposed by Yaman)\nnorm2 = lambda v: sqrt(v.inner(v))\n\n# Psydac objects, solver with tolerance = tol\nu\nB_ILO = inverse(B, 'cg', tol=tol)\n\n# First test: Check whether B_ILO**0 is the identity matrix (B_ILO**0 = id?)\n\nerror = (B_ILO**0) @ u - u\nassert norm2(error) < 1e-15 # error should really be zero\n\n# Second test: Check whether B_ILO**1 really computes the inverse up to accuracy (B_ILO**1 = B_ILO?)\n# I.e., we expect B @ B_ILO**1 @ u to be equal to u + err, err a vector of norm less than tol\n\nerror = B @ B_ILO**1 @ u - u\nassert norm2(error) < tol\n\n# Third test: Now checking whether B_ILO**2 is really equal to a double application of B_ILO (B_ILO**2 = B_ILO @ B_ILO?)\n# B @ B @ B_ILO @ B_ILO @ u = B @ ( B_ILO @ u + err1 ) = u + err2 + B @ err1\n# where both err1 and err2 are vectors of norm less than tol, hence\n# | B @ B @ B_ILO @ B_ILO @ u - u | = | err2 + B @ err1 | < | err2 | + | B @ err1 | < tol + |B|_{inf} * tol = (1 + |B|_{inf}) * tol\n\nadjusted_tol = ( 1 + np.max(np.abs(B.toarray())) ) * tol\nerror = B @ B @ B_ILO**2 @ u - u\nassert norm2(error) < adjusted_tol" ],

Especially when you have a long list of layers, its quite tedious to move the mouse cursor down without leaving the hover state. A transition or transition-delay would help, however I have been unable to implement this with pure css. \n\nI have found a workaround by triggering the collapse manually, however its causes other issues, like re-entering while not clearing older timeouts. Probably needs a debounce fn.\nhttps://plnkr.co/edit/WQyfFctUqs7mNdq9\n\nOn another note, a collapseDelay option would work really well to make it customizable.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nLayer control stays for 1-2 seconds after leaving hover state.\n\n### Current behavior\n\nLayer control disappears instantly after leaving hover state\n\n### Minimal example reproducing the issue\n\n_No response_\n\n### Environment\n\n- Leaflet version: 1.9.3\n- Browser (with version): Chrome\n- OS/Platform (with version): Mac/Windows latest\n",

This image will be used by all SCORE-related repositories (dozens in total), so it must be robust, reusable, and actively maintained.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Current Situation\n\nWe currently require a number of tools to be installed in addition to Bazel. This includes Python, Graphviz, Bazelisk, and shell autocompletion for Bazel. These tools are not always easy to install correctly across different systems, especially for new contributors.\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDE80 Solution\n\nImplement a reusable Devcontainer setup based on a Docker image that includes all required tools preinstalled. The image should be published to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) and referenced via `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` or `.devcontainer.json` in consuming repositories.\n\n**Target image name:** `ghcr.io/eclipse-score/devcontainer`\n\nThe base image should include:\n\n- Based on an extended Ubuntu image, quite certainly:\n  - `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/python:1.2-3.12`\n- Preinstalled tools:\n  - Python (needed for Bazel formatting bug workaround)\n  - Graphviz\n  - Bazelisk (with current bazel version pre-downloaded)\n  - Shell autocompletion for Bazel\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDEE0️ Concrete Tasks\n\n- [ ] Create a new GitHub repository (name: `eclipse-score/devcontainer`)\n- [ ] Create a `Dockerfile` that installs all required tools\n- [ ] Add GitHub Actions workflow to:\n  - Build the image\n  - Optional: Tag it with semantic version (e.g. `v1.0.0`) and `latest`\n  - Push to GHCR under `ghcr.io/eclipse-score/devcontainer`\n- [ ] Optional: Add typical metadata to the container\n- [ ] Use the image from GHCR in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` or `.devcontainer.json` in at least one repo (e.g. `score`)\n- [ ] Verify that all tools are functional inside the container\n- [ ] Optional: Add documentation (`README.md`) to `eclipse-score/devcontainer`\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDD04 Considered Alternatives\n\nSome tools could theoretically be installed via Bazel, but this was previously evaluated and rejected due to high implementation and maintenance cost. We chose to use system-level tools with clear documentation instead.\n\n---\n\n### \uD83E\uDDE0 Notes\n\n- The image will become the base for all development work across the SCORE ecosystem\n- Keep it generic, stable, and easy to extend.\n- This devcontainer will remain entirely optional, it's just meant to ease the pain of installing all the required tools.\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDCDA References\n\n- Example: [`eclipse-score/score/.devcontainer`](https://github.com/eclipse-score/score/tree/main/.devcontainer)\n- Docs: [Development Environment Setup](https://eclipse-score.github.io/score/main/contribute/development/development_environment.html#autocompletion-in-the-shell)\n",

This way users get a heads-up and have a chance to cancel before the payment goes through.\n\n### Describe the Use Case\n\nI add a recurring subscription payment (e.g. Spotify on the 15th of each month).\nI'd like the option to set a reminder X days before (e.g. 3 days before), so Dime sends me a notification like:\n\n“Your Spotify subscription is going to renew in 3 days — consider canceling if you don’t need it.”\n\nThis reduces the risk of forgetting to cancel and incurring charges for services I don’t use anymore.\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_",

Forked and cloned the repository, then searched the codebase for `readline` usage to find the core input handling logic.\n2.  Identified `useKeypress.ts` (for raw keypress events) and `InputPrompt.tsx` (for input logic) as the key files.\n3.  To see what the application receives, I temporarily modified the code to log every keypress event to a `debug.log` file.\n4.  **Key Finding:** My initial debugging proved that on a default macOS Terminal, `Shift+Enter` sends the exact same sequence (`\\r`) as a regular `Enter` press, making the two indistinguishable.\n\n### Attempted Fix & The Final Discovery\n\nBased on the initial finding, I attempted a code-only fix by teaching the application to listen for a different key combination, `Shift+Down`, which often sends a unique sequence on other terminals.\n\n1. The Code I Tested\nI modified `useKeypress.ts` to listen for the `Shift+Down` sequence (`\\x1b[1;2B`) and `InputPrompt.tsx` to handle a `key.shift` flag.\n\n```typescript\n// In useKeypress.ts, I added a check:\nif (key.sequence === '\\x1b[1;2B') {\n  key.name = 'return';\n  key.shift = true;\n}\n```\n```typescript\n// In InputPrompt.tsx, I added the key.shift check:\nif (key.ctrl || key.meta || key.shift || charBefore === '\\\\' || key.paste) {\n  // ... newline logic\n}\n```\n\n2. The Result: It Also Failed\nThis proof-of-concept did not work. To understand why, I used the `cat` command to see what my terminal was actually sending when I pressed `Shift+Down`.\nFinal Proof: The terminal sent `^[[B`, which is the standard escape code for a plain Cursor Down key.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis investigation leads to a definitive conclusion: the default macOS Terminal is more limited than anticipated. It appears to strip the `Shift` modifier information from both the `Enter` key and the arrow keys, making a code-only fix for a `Shift+Key` newline combination unfeasible on this specific platform, although i think this might work on other platforms which by default register shift + down as '\\x1b[1;2B' but i cant really test it.\n\nThis might explain why `Ctrl+J` is a common suggested alternative, as it sends a universal newline character (`\\n`) that doesn't rely on modifier key parsing.\n\nAs this is my first contribution, my analysis could be wrong, and I apologize for the detailed-but-failed attempt. Given these findings, what is the desired path forward? Any information from the internal `b.corp.google.com` link about how other terminals are supported would still be very helpful.\n\nThank you for your time and guidance.", "Just to add, I personally use the Warp Terminal on Mac.

Support custom entity patterns via regex\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n- Add optional dependency group:\n  ```toml\n  optional-dependencies.entity-extraction = [\n    \"gliner>=0.2.0\",  # State-of-the-art zero-shot NER, outperforms spaCy\n    \"keybert>=0.8.0\",  # Most accurate keyword extraction\n  ]\n  ```\n- **Library Choice Rationale**: \n  - Use GLiNER for NER based on 2024 benchmarks showing superior zero-shot performance and flexibility compared to spaCy\n  - Use KeyBERT for keyword extraction as it provides the highest accuracy among RAKE, YAKE, and KeyBERT\n- Add to `ExtractionConfig`:\n  ```python\n  extract_entities: bool = False\n  extract_keywords: bool = False\n  keyword_count: int = 10\n  custom_entity_patterns: dict[str, str] | None = None  # {\"INVOICE_ID\": r\"INV-\\d+\"}\n  ```\n- Add to `ExtractionResult`:\n  ```python\n  entities: list[Entity] | None = None\n  keywords: list[tuple[str, float]] | None = None  # (keyword, score)\n  ```\n- Create `kreuzberg/_entity_extraction.py` module\n- Define `Entity` dataclass with `type`, `text`, `start`, `end` fields\n\n**Testing Requirements:**\n- Test entity extraction on various document types\n- Test custom pattern matching\n- Test keyword extraction with different document lengths\n- Mock spacy models in unit tests\n- Test handling of missing dependencies\n- Verify performance impact is acceptable",

      "description" : "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Kong version (`$ kong version`)\n\nKong Enterprise 3.6.1.1\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nI've got reports from users from my API that they get compressed output when the response was cached from another user.\r\n\r\nLets say for instance a `/api/healthz` page is called from one client with gzip compression enabled and then another client makes straight away another call to the same endpoint, then the second client is served the compressed cached content but in a not readable format.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI expected that the proxy-cache plugin does take the compression part in consideration and returns a non-compressed content to the second client.\r\n\r\nOr maybe something some possibility to convert compressed cached content to non-compressed content? I don't know exactly.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. add proxy-cache plugin to a route\r\n2. run curl command with compression enabled\r\n   ```console\r\n   curl --compressed https://example.com/api/healthz -v --output -\r\n   ```\r\n4. run curl command without compression right afterwards\r\n   ```console\r\n   curl https://example.com/api/healthz -v --output -\r\n   ```\r\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\nThis is my Kubernetes resource:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\napiVersion: configuration.konghq.com/v1\r\nkind: KongPlugin\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: my-cache-1min\r\n  namespace: my-api-v4\r\nconfig:\r\n  cache_ttl: 60\r\n  content_type:\r\n    - text/plain\r\n    - application/json\r\n    - application/json; charset=utf-8\r\n  request_method:\r\n    - GET\r\n    - HEAD\r\n  response_code:\r\n    - 200\r\n  ignore_uri_case: true\r\n  strategy: memory\r\nplugin: proxy-cache\r\n```",

You can try the following methods to deal with this issue:\n\n1. Reduce the training batch size `per_device_train_batch_size: 1`\n2. Replace compute kernels `enable_liger_kernel: true` and `use_unsloth_gc: true`\n3. Reduce the maximum sequence length `cutoff_len: 512`\n4. Use DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 or FSDP to partition model weights on multiple devices or use CPU offloading\n5. Set `quantization_bit: 4` to quantize model parameters (only compatible with LoRA tuning)\n6. Use the paged optimizer `optim: paged_adamw_8bit`\n\n模型训练时显存溢出，通常是由于当前某个设备的剩余显存不足以完成计算任务。可尝试下述方法解决：\n\n1. 降低批处理大小 `per_device_train_batch_size: 1`\n2. 替换模型算子 `enable_liger_kernel: true` 和 `use_unsloth_gc: true`\n3. 降低最大序列长度 `cutoff_len: 512`\n4. 使用 DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 或 FSDP 将模型权重拆分到多个设备或使用 CPU Offloading\n5. 设置 `quantization_bit: 4` 量化模型参数（仅限于 LoRA 方法）\n6. 使用分页低精度优化器 `optim: paged_adamw_8bit`\n\n----\n\n### Unsatisfying fine-tuning results / 微调效果无法令人满意\n\nUnsatisfying fine-tuning results are usually due to insufficient training samples, leading to underfitting. You can try the following methods to deal with this issue:\n\n1. Increase the size of the training dataset\n2. Increase the number of epochs `num_train_epochs: 5.0` or steps `max_steps: 1000`\n3. Use a larger learning rate `learning_rate: 2.0e-4`\n4. Use different fine-tuning method `finetuning_type: freeze` or `finetuning_type: full`\n\n微调效果较差，通常是由于训练样本过少，导致模型欠拟合。可尝试下述方法解决：\n\n1. 增加训练数据集的大小\n2. 提高训练轮数 `num_train_epochs: 5.0` 或步数 `max_steps: 1000`\n3. 增大学习率 `learning_rate: 2.0e-4`\n4. 使用不同的微调方法 `finetuning_type: freeze` 或 `finetuning_type: full`\n\n----\n\n### Corrupted or repeated model responses / 胡乱或重复的模型回答\n\nIf this issue occurs before training, it is usually due to using an unaligned (base) model or a mismatched `template`. Please ensure an aligned (instruct/chat) model and correct `template` are used.\nIf this issue occurs after training, please check if the `template` used for training and inference is consistent. And do not forget to check if the overfitting appeared. You can try decreasing the number of epochs `num_train_epochs` and learning rate `learning_rate` to deal with the overfitting issue.\n\n若该问题发生在训练之前，通常是由于使用了未经对齐（base）的模型或不恰当的模板 `template`，请保证使用对齐后（instruct/chat）的模型和正确的模板 `template`。\n若该问题发生在训练之后，请检查训练和推理使用的模板 `template` 是否一致，同时检查是否发生了过拟合。如果发生了过拟合，请减小训练轮数 `num_train_epochs` 和学习率 `learning_rate`。\n\n----\n\n### Training hangs / 训练进程卡住\n\nIf distributed training was not enabled, please use the following command to check if the CUDA version of PyTorch is installed correctly:\n\n如果没有使用分布式训练，请使用下述命令检查 CUDA 版本的 PyTorch 是否被正确安装：\n\n```bash\npython -c \"import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())\"\n```\n\nIf distributed training was enabled, try setting the environment variable `export NCCL_P2P_LEVEL=NVL`.\n\n如果使用了分布式训练，请尝试设置环境变量 `export NCCL_P2P_LEVEL=NVL`。\n\n----\n\n### LLaMA Board cannot display datasets / LLaMA Board 无法显示数据集\n\nPlease ensure that the working directory when launching the LLaMA Board is the same as the LLaMA-Factory directory.\n\n请确保启动 LLaMA Board 时的工作目录与 LLaMA-Factory 主目录一致。\n\n----\n\n### How to shard model weights on multiple devices / 如何模型权重拆分到多个设备上\n\nDuring the training phase, please refer to the [examples](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory/blob/main/examples/README.md#supervised-fine-tuning-with-deepspeed-zero-3-weight-sharding) about how to use the DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 (recommended) or FSDP.\nDuring the inference phase, please use vLLM to enable the tensor parallelism: [examples](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory/tree/main/examples#inferring-lora-fine-tuned-models).\n\n在训练阶段，请参考 [examples](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory/blob/main/examples/README_zh.md#%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8-deepspeed-zero-3-%E5%B9%B3%E5%9D%87%E5%88%86%E9%85%8D%E6%98%BE%E5%AD%98) 使用 DeepSpeed ZeRO-3（推荐）或 FSDP。\n在推理阶段，请使用 vLLM 来开启张量并行：[examples](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory/blob/main/examples/README_zh.md#%E6%8E%A8%E7%90%86-lora-%E6%A8%A1%E5%9E%8B).\n\n----\n\n### How to use ORPO or SimPO / 如何使用 ORPO 或 SimPO\n\nModify the `pref_loss` in [example script](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory/blob/main/examples/train_lora/llama3_lora_dpo.yaml) to `orpo` or `simpo`.\n\n将[示例脚本](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory/blob/main/examples/train_lora/llama3_lora_dpo.yaml) 中的 `pref_loss` 改为 `orpo` 或 `simpo`。\n\n----\n\n### How to debug with VSCode / 如何用 VSCode 调试程序\n\nSee #5337\n\n----\n\n### Why the number of examples is small in pre-training / 为什么预训练样本数比实际的少\n\nWe automatically use packing in pre-training, where we concatenate multiple samples into one sequence, so the number of examples displayed is less than the actual number.\n\n我们在预训练时候自动使用了 Packing，将多个样本打包成一条序列，因此显示的样本数量会比实际的少。\n\n----\n\n### Will the training data be shuffled / 训练数据是否会被打乱\n\nLLaMA-Factory will randomly shuffle the training data by default. You can use `disable_shuffling` to turn off the shuffling.\n\nLLaMA-Factory 默认会随机打乱训练数据，可使用 `disable_shuffling` 关闭打乱。\n\n----\n\n### How to enable streaming / 如何启用流式数据读取\n\nWe recommend shuffling the dataset before training if you want to use streaming. Add the following arguments to your yaml file.\n\n如果您希望使用流式数据读取，请在训练前手动打乱数据。将下面的参数添加到 YAML 文件中。\n\n```yaml\nbuffer_size: 128\npreprocessing_batch_size: 128\nstreaming: true\naccelerator_config:\n  dispatch_batches: false\n```\n\n----\n\n### How to resolve `Processor was not found` / 如何解决 `Processor was not found`\n\nPlease run the following code and paste the full error log to Issue.\n\n请运行下面的代码并粘贴完整报错信息到 Issue。\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoProcessor\nprocessor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(\"path-to-your-model\")\n```\n\n----\n\n> [!TIP]\n> If the problems still exist with the **latest** code, please create an issue.\n> 若使用**最新的**代码仍然无法解决问题，请创建一个 issue。\n",

      "description" : "### Motivation\n\nThis issue attempt to reduce the gap of unit tests to cover the code. There is a brief architecture of ut in `tests/ut/` already. We need to add more to cover all the code in vllm-ascend, and there are several principles to follow:\n\n1. The overall file tree should be consistent with `vllm_ascend`\n2. The file name should be the original file name with a prefix `test_`\n3. Use `unittest` framework, make good use of mock\n4. The UTs are all running on cpu node, mock the function related to device to host\n\nPlease refer to the official doc on [contributing](https://vllm-ascend.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide/contribution/index.html) and [testing](https://vllm-ascend.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide/contribution/testing.html) to develop, thanks!\n### Unit tests need to add\n\n- [ ] |-- test__version.py\n- [x] |-- test_ascend_config.py\n- [ ] |-- test_attention\n- [ ] |   |-- test_attention.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_attention_v1.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_mla_v1.py\n- [ ] |-- compilation\n- [ ] |   `-- test_piecewise_backend.py\n- [ ] |-- core\n- [ ] |   |-- test_schedule_config.py @nuclearwu\n- [ ] |   `-- test_scheduler.py\n- [ ] |-- device_allocator\n- [ ] |   `-- test_camem.py\n- [ ] |-- distributed\n- [ ] |   |-- test_communicator.py @FieeFlip\n- [ ] |   |-- test_device_communicators\n- [ ] |   |   |-- test_pyhccl.py\n- [ ] |   |   `-- test_pyhccl_wrapper.py\n- [x] |   |-- kv_transfer @Agonixiaoxiao \n- [x] |   |   |-- test_simple_buffer.py https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1531\n- [x] |   |   |-- test_simple_connector.py https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1531\n- [x] |   |   |-- test_simple_pipe.py https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1531\n- [ ] |   |   `-- test_utils.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_llmdatadist_connector.py\n- [x] |   `-- test_parallel_state.py   @wangyanhui-cmss https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1460\n- [ ] |-- test_envs.py\n- [ ] |-- lora\n- [ ] |   `-- punica_wrapper @hongfugui\n- [ ] |       `-- test_punica_npu.py @hongfugui\n- [ ] |-- models\n- [ ] |   |-- test_deepseek_dbo.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_deepseek_mtp.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_deepseek_v2.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_qwen2_5_vl.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_qwen2_5_vl_without_padding.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_qwen2_vl.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_qwen3_moe.py\n- [ ] |-- multistream\n- [ ] |   |-- test_base.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_context.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_decorator.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_layers.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_metadata.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_ms_split.py\n- [ ] |-- ops\n- [ ] |   |-- test_activation.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_attention.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_cache.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_common_fused_moe.py\n- [x] |   |-- test_expert_load_balancer.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_fused_moe.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_layernorm.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_rotary_embedding.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_vocab_parallel_embedding.py\n- [ ] |-- patch\n- [ ] |   |-- platform\n- [ ] |   |   |-- patch_0_9_1\n- [ ] |   |   |-- patch_common\n- [ ] |   |   |   `-- test_test_patch_distributed.py\n- [ ] |   |   `-- patch_main\n- [ ] |   `-- worker\n- [ ] |       |-- patch_0_9_1\n- [ ] |       |-- patch_common\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_distributed.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_eagle.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_minicpm.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_multi_step_worker.py\n- [x] |       |   |-- test_patch_sampler.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_spec_decode_worker.py\n- [ ] |       |   `-- test_patch_utils.py\n- [ ] |       `-- patch_main\n- [x] |-- test_platform.py @zhanghw0354 https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1476\n- [ ] |-- quantization\n- [ ] |   |-- test_func_wrapper.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_quant_config.py @nuclearwu\n- [ ] |   |-- test_quantizer.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_w8a8.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_w8a8_dynamic.py\n- [ ] |-- sample\n- [ ] |   |-- ops\n- [ ] |   `-- test_rejection_sampler.py\n- [x] |-- test_utils.py\n- [ ] `-- worker \n- [ ] |-- test_cache_engine.py @machenglong2025\n- [ ] |-- test_draft_model_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_model_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_model_runner_v1.py\n- [ ]  |-- test_mtp_proposer_v1.py @machenglong2025\n- [ ] |-- test_multi_step_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_multi_step_worker.py\n- [ ] |-- test_pooling_model_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_worker.py @zhanghw0354\n- [ ] `-- test_worker_v1.py @zhanghw0354\n",

I'm [Dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot) and I’m helping the incubator-hugegraph-doc team.\n\n<!-- Answer -->\nTo enable Mermaid diagram rendering in the HugeGraph documentation, add the following to your `config.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[params.mermaid]\nenable = true\n\n[markup]\n  [markup.highlight]\n    guessSyntax = false\n```\n\nThis activates the built-in Docsy/Hugo support for Mermaid diagrams, so code blocks with `mermaid` will render as diagrams instead of raw text. The site already includes the necessary scripts and logic to load and initialize Mermaid.js when this config is present [source](https://github.com/apache/incubator-hugegraph-doc/blob/48ff6f261c634e8d8ae9c4fac9e21524f67424b5/themes/docsy/layouts/partials/scripts.html).\n\nFor image issues: make sure all images referenced in documentation are stored locally (for example, in the `static/` directory) rather than using remote URLs, which can break or be blocked [source](https://github.com/apache/incubator-hugegraph-doc/blob/48ff6f261c634e8d8ae9c4fac9e21524f67424b5/config.toml). Hosting all third-party resources (like Mermaid.js, images, fonts) locally also helps avoid CSP and privacy policy issues [source](https://github.com/apache/incubator-hugegraph-doc/issues/388).\n\nAfter updating the configuration and image locations, rebuild the site and the diagrams/images should render as expected.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

The theme logic in this repo only loads Mermaid scripts if `.Site.Params.mermaid.enable` is set, so the specific `var params = null` TypeError cannot occur here. Your Mermaid diagrams are not rendering because the required config is missing, not due to the upstream bug.\n\nTo fix Mermaid rendering, add this to your `config.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[params.mermaid]\nenable = true\n\n[markup]\n  [markup.highlight]\n    guessSyntax = false\n```\n\nThis will enable Mermaid support and ensure diagrams render as expected.

I guess in theory if we're really careful about the lookup logic (and the KVStore is async) we could do the loading in parallel (though its still a few more requests) but we'd still have to wait on compaction (without a background-compaction task running, which would require a generic `spawn` method...). Seems much easier to just check the length and skip some code for the common case :)", "If I understand it correctly, this is special casing for channels at the beginning of their life and when they grow, the node will switch over to persisting updates and compaction anyway?\n\nTo me it isn't quite clear if this is really worth it. If the hit is significant, it is also a problem when the channel has outgrown the 'small' stage anyway?", "> If I understand it correctly, this is special casing for channels at the beginning of their life and when they grow, the node will switch over to persisting updates and compaction anyway?\n\nYes.\n\n> To me it isn't quite clear if this is really worth it. If the hit is significant, it is also a problem when the channel has outgrown the 'small' stage anyway?\n\nIts more a recognition of two very different cases - if you're running an \"edge node\" that is just a wallet making occasional payments, then you're likely to never hit the \"large\" stage, and thus avoiding the compaction overhead is a really nice optimization. If you're a larger node that is forwarding/processing many payments, you're very likely to hit the \"large\" stage and the compaction penalty is worth it to avoid the writes.", "At what size would the \"large\" stage be entered then typically and how many htlcs/channel updates is that? A channel monitor of a few kb, that doesn't sound like all that many updates?", "Yea, dunno, we'd have to figure that out. I imagine most mobile nodes probably make in the 100s to low 1000s of payments in their entire lifetime, probably fewer on a single channel once you consider splicing and the like. 10KiB or whatever should be plenty for 100 or 250 payments.", "> Its more a recognition of two very different cases\n\nIt sounds like if you wanted to make this automatic, the metric you'd really want to evaluate to switch this behavior isn't so much monitor size, as one of these:\n\n  - Frequency of updates to the channel\n  - Latency of updates to the channel (more difficult)\n\nThe monitor size is a decent reflection of the _number_ of updates to the channel[1], but with no perception of time it's impossible to evaluate whether it's being stored by a tenured edge node, or a routing node. I think if you took time into account, perhaps by using the block delta between the funding tx and chain tip to estimate update frequency, you could make a more informed assessment.\n\nHowever, I worry that automating the behavior selection is not really following the \"principle of least astonishment.\" \n\nI would think that routing nodes rarely move to the edge, and edge nodes rarely become routing nodes (more often, a routing node starts small and may appear like an edge). And furthermore, I know what my node is likely to be; especially if I'm a Lightning developer and managing this on behalf of users, such as in a mobile wallet.\n\nFor that matter, varying the behavior _per channel_ seems to make node persistence more difficult to reason about. Different channels could persist different ways on my node, depending on a size threshold. Which means they can change without me doing anything. I would think that if the reason for variation is the use case, then one behavior is correct for all channels stored by the node.\n\nIn that light, I'd just leave this a configurable behavior, which I think it is now.\n\n[1] I recognize that size is being used here to evaluate the storage write size, not the number of updates. But I think that is why the discussion is unclear. Compared to update count/frequency, it's much harder to know the storage configuration of a given node, and what the throughput/latency tradeoff is like.", "I think the intent of the proposed change is to optimize for the edge-node case with remote storage. Even an edge node may make enough payments to get a monitor up to 10s of KiB in size, at which point network-level effects like TCP slowstart may dominate the actual network latency. For a \"power-user\" edge node, we really want to use the `MonitorUpdatingPersister`, but paying the extra RTT cost of cleanup on load for every edge node is not a great tradeoff either.\n\nFor a routing node, it still seems to me like a size-based threshold may be something they want, purely as it (very marginally) reduces IO throughput for under-utilized or new channels. Writing out updates (padded to 4KiB or more depending on the storage medium) and then consolidating when the whole monitor is only a few KiB isn't really the right tradeoff no matter what. Of course a routing node is expected to surpass the threshold very quickly, so it shouldn't really make a substantial difference, but it seems strictly better to write out full updates in this case than not.\n\nIndeed, this does lead to a bit of behavior shift, but I think the important metrics wouldn't change - first of all, if you happened to look at storage right after compaction, the stored contents would be identical to a full monitor persistence so I wouldn't really say that this materially changes the way that logic would interact with the stored data (you already have to handle the case of having no in-flight updates!). It also shouldn't materially change the IO throughput or write count for any node, just a fairly marginal strict reduction for routing nodes with fresh channels.", "> At what size would the \"large\" stage be entered then typically and how many htlcs/channel updates is that? A channel monitor of a few kb, that doesn't sound like all that many updates?\n\nFor our probing node running ldk-node with network storage (EFS), at around 20,000 updates over the single channel the average probe duration starts to increase substantially. p75 starts to creep up after about 3,000.", "Do y'all have any further thoughts here, @domZippilli or @amackillop?", "> Do y'all have any further thoughts here, [@domZippilli](https://github.com/domZippilli) or [@amackillop](https://github.com/amackillop)?\n\nI see in the PR it's configurable. I think as long as that's the case, developers who don't want the variation in behavior can set the minimum size to `0`.\n\neta: Also, I'm still not sure I like that it varies across channels, rather than a consistent behavior on a node.", "Perhaps wait for developers who do want/need the variation in behavior to show up and only then implement? I think the \"principle of least astonishment\" is worth considering.", "> Perhaps wait for developers who do want/need the variation in behavior to show up and only then implement? I think the \"principle of least astonishment\" is worth considering.\n\nWell, we likely do want to enable MUP in LDK Node, especially when persisting vs. remote storage/VSS. The question is whether it's preferable to *always* use MUP, even for very small monitors. I'd be reluctant to expose a setting in LDK Node for this, as I don't think our users would have better insight into which way to go than we do.", "> Perhaps wait for developers who do want/need the variation in behavior to show up and only then implement? I think the \"principle of least astonishment\" is worth considering.\n\nFWIW I think the \"principle of least astonishment\" is served perfectly fine by changing the MUP to persist full monitors when they're small - there's no material difference in user-visible behavior between persisting full monitors and small ones, except the performance changes (i.e. we definitely can't persist full monitors that are huge). When persisting small monitors, its no difference from hitting the cleanup ID where we delete the updates anyway. Because of this I still think this change is *strictly better* than the current version.", ">there's no material difference in user-visible behavior between persisting full monitors and small ones\n\nThat's clear. I was thinking of least astonishment in reasoning about and resolving potential problems. Basically what @domZippilli mentions in https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/3770#issuecomment-2984271612.\n\nIn this case, I would define 'strictly better' as a performance increase without an increase in complexity." ],

When the API key is empty, the header becomes `Authorization: Basic ` or `Authorization: Bearer `, which is considered an illegal header value by the HTTP library and causes the execution to fail ([source](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/blob/bb955806e042517831b232948c3f9f7150ac5fb6/api/core/workflow/nodes/http_request/executor.py)). The code only checks that the API key field exists, not that it contains a non-empty value.\n\nAs a workaround, avoid configuring HTTPRequest nodes with empty API keys for these auth types. If your workflow might have an empty key, consider adding logic to skip the HTTPRequest node or switch to \"no-auth\" when the key is empty. There’s currently no built-in validation or warning for this in Dify, so it’s a systemic issue, not a new regression.\n\nNo official documentation or existing issues address this yet. It would be helpful for the platform to add validation or user warnings for empty API keys in future releases.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

      "description" : "### Apache Airflow version\n\n3.0.2\n\n### If \"Other Airflow 2 version\" selected, which one?\n\n_No response_\n\n### What happened?\n\nI opened the Trigger Dag form in the Airflow 3 UI and filled in parameters under the section “Run Parameters” (or under “Advanced Options → Configuration JSON”). \n\nWhen I submit the form to backfill a historical date range, the DAG run is created and executes, but the parameters I entered are not actually passed into the tasks. Inside the task, references like {{ params.my_param }} or accessing context[\"params\"][\"my_param\"] remain unset. \n\nAlthough the UI shows the parameters form, these values never make it into the task context. \n\n### What you think should happen instead?\n\nWhen I trigger a backfill from the Airflow 3 UI and enter parameters in the Run Parameters or Advanced Options → Configuration JSON, these values should be passed to each DAG run created during the backfill.\n\nInside the DAG, I should be able to access them using:\n\t•\t{{ params.my_param }} in templates\n\t•\tcontext[\"params\"][\"my_param\"] in Python code\n\nThis is how it works when triggering a single DAG run from the UI, so the behavior should be the same for backfills. The parameters entered in the UI should override the defaults defined in the DAG and be available in all backfilled runs.\n\n### How to reproduce\n\n1.\tCreate the following DAG:\n\n```\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom airflow.decorators import dag, task\nfrom airflow.models.param import Param, ParamsDict\n\n@task\ndef test_backfill_with_params(params: ParamsDict):\n    assert params.get(\"id\") is not None\n\n@dag(\n    dag_id='test_backfill',\n    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),\n    schedule='@daily',\n    catchup=False,\n    default_args={'owner': 'Gery', 'retries': 0},\n    params={\n        \"id\": Param(default=None, title=\"My id\", description=\"My id\", type=[\"null\", \"string\"]),\n    }\n)\ndef test_backfill_dag():\n    test_backfill_with_params()\n\ntest_backfill_dag()\n```\n\n2.\tGo to the Airflow 3 UI.\n3.\tOpen the Backfill modal for the test_backfill DAG.\n4.\tSet a date range (e.g., start and end: 2025-06-01 00:00 and 2025-06-02 00:00).\n5.\tIn the Run Parameters section, set id = \"1234\".\n6.\tTrigger the backfill.\n\nExpected: The DAG run(s) should pass \"id\": \"1234\" to the task, and the assertion should pass.\nActual: The parameter is not passed, and the task fails due to params.get(\"id\") being None.\n\n### Operating System\n\nMac OS 14.6 (23G80)\n\n### Versions of Apache Airflow Providers\n\nNo providers\n\n### Deployment\n\nDocker-Compose\n\n### Deployment details\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Are you willing to submit PR?\n\n- [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n",

However, if you look at all this in General keep in mind that we also have also such scenarios on purpose:\n```\ncontext.requireOnline(purpose, false);\ntry {\n  doSomethingWithNetwork();\n} catch (IOException e) {\n  if (isOfflineMode()) {\n    return false;\n  }\n  throw e;\n}\n```\n\nThe idea of this pattern is that we do not have to do too many pointless online requests (flooding github.com) and prevent that if github.com would be done for whatever reason that this blocks all other network operations of IDEasy.", "While I was looking through the usages of `isOnline()`, I found this method inside `GitContextImpl.java`:\n\n\n```\n  private void handleErrors(Path targetRepository, ProcessResult result) {\n    if (!result.isSuccessful()) {\n      String message = \"Failed to update git repository at \" + targetRepository;\n      if (this.context.isOffline()) {\n        this.context.warning(message);\n        this.context.interaction(\"Continuing as we are in offline mode - results may be outdated!\");\n      } else {\n        this.context.error(message);\n        if (this.context.isOnline()) {\n          this.context.error(\"See above error for details.

Do you want to continue anyways?\");\n      }\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nI am a little bit confused about the functionality: in the `if` it says  `if (this.context.isOffline())` which means `if (!isOnline() || isOfflineMode())` but then in the interaction underneath, it says `\"Continuing as we are in offline mode - results may be outdated!\"` which does not have to be true - we could also be actually offline and not just in offline mode.\n\nThen inside the `else` we check `if (this.context.isOnline())` and then also do an `else` here. This `else` will never be used, as inside this Block `isOnline() && !isOfflineMode()` is true.\n\n@hohwille  Should this method be refactored?" ],

Also, if the nodetool API is already ambgious (what does the \"a:b\" the user passed mean?) there is no way that additional encoding can fix it.\r\n\r\nIf you change anything in this area, please don't forget to add tests.", "From the api standpoint what I had in mind is to pass `key=a%3Ab` if the non-composite key (or one of its components) contains `:`.\r\nThe user can pass that to nodetool as well.\r\n\r\nThat said, allowing passing multiple components as request parameters is possible too, though with the current interface it is not intuitive to assume that the multiple key parameters indicate multiple components of a composite key rather than multiple keys, if the API supported returning the natural endpoints for multiple keys.\r\n\r\nNote that `%3A` is supported for `keyspace:table` \"tuples\" when passed as a single parameter or as a comma-separated list of `keyspace:table`, to support keyspace or table names containing `:`.", "> From the api standpoint what I had in mind is to pass `key=a%3Ab` if the non-composite key (or one of its components) contains `:`. The user can pass that to nodetool as well.\r\n\r\n`key=a%3Ab` is the url-encoded form of setting key to `a:b`. But now that Scylla receives it, how does it know if this was intended to be a string key `a:b` or two components?\r\n\r\nMaybe you were thinking of encoding **twice**? If that's the case, the first layer of encoding doesn't need to be URL encoding. Just the outer layer of encoding must be.\r\n\r\nAre you sure about what you said about `keyspace:table` allowing real \":\"? Last time I checked, I found that at least in one context, you are only allowed to have colons in the table name, not keyspace name (e.g., in Alternator GSI), and what happens is simply that Scylla splits only on the first colon, so `xyz:abc:qwe` means that `xyz` is the keyspace, `abc:qwe` is the table.

Here's my approach:\r\n\r\n      def astro_support:\r\n          class AstroSupport:\r\n              def __init__(self):\r\n                  # Call both quantity and time support functions and assign them to a class variable, e.g., self.q_support\r\n                 \r\n              def __enter__(self):\r\n                  # Enter both quantity and time support context\r\n                  \r\n              def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):\r\n                  # Exit both quantity and time support context\r\n               \r\n          return AstroSupport()  # Return an instance so the function can be used without managing the context manually\r\nI would need to look into other parameters passed to quantity_support and time_support, but otherwise, this approach should work.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you think this is a good direction or if there are any additional considerations or improvements I should be aware of.\r\n\r\nP.S. I am a beginner, so please excuse any mistakes or oversights!\r\n\r\n\r\n", "@spranav1205 Hi, thanks for looking into this !\r\n\r\nNowadays Python's standard lib is richer and I think we can go with a simpler desgin that the one that was choosen at the time for `time_support` and `quantity_support`.\r\nIn particular, for this specific task of combining existing context managers, I think we should use (or take inspiration from) [`contextlib.ExitStack`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.ExitStack).", "We can use the following approach to combine `quantity_support` and `time_support` using a function, without the need for a class:\r\n\r\n    @contextmanager\r\n    def astro_support():\r\n     \r\n        q = quantity_support()\r\n        t = time_support()\r\n        \r\n        try:\r\n            q.__enter__()\r\n            t.__enter__()\r\n            yield  \r\n        finally:\r\n            q.__exit__()\r\n            t.__exit__()\r\n\r\nWith this implementation, astro_support can be used as a context manager with the `with` statement, but it can't be used independently like` quantity_support()` or `time_support()`.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we can implement `astro_support` as a class, which can act both as a context manager (with `with`) and as a decorator for functions. This would look something like:\r\n\r\n    class astro_support(ContextDecorator):\r\n              def __init__(self):\r\n                  # Call both quantity and time support functions and assign them to a class variable, e.g., self.q_support\r\n                 \r\n              def __enter__(self):\r\n                  # Enter both quantity and time support context\r\n                  \r\n              def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):\r\n                  # Exit both quantity and time support context\r\n                  \r\nWould you like me to implement either of these? Or should we explore some other method?\r\n", "Actually the `contextlib.contexmanager` implementation also allows using it as a decorator\r\n\r\nquoting from https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.contextmanager\r\n> [contextmanager()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.contextmanager) uses [ContextDecorator](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.ContextDecorator) so the context managers it creates can be used as decorators as well as in [with](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#with) statements. When used as a decorator, a new generator instance is implicitly created on each function call (this allows the otherwise “one-shot” context managers created by [contextmanager()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.contextmanager) to meet the requirement that context managers support multiple invocations in order to be used as decorators).\r\n\r\nSo my preference is to go with the first approach as it's simpler. Note that it is generally not recommended to call so-called dunder[^1] methods like `__enter__` and `__exit__` directly, so I would favor something like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom contextlib import contextmanager, ExitStack\r\n\r\n@contextmanager\r\ndef astro_support():\r\n    with ExitStack() as stack:\r\n        stack.enter_context(quantity_support())\r\n        stack.enter_context(time_support())\r\n        yield\r\n```\r\n\r\n[^1]: \"dunder\" is short for \"double underscore\" and is a common way to refer to Python's protocols that are named with two leading and two trailing underscores", "Yes, this works perfectly. I have opened a PR #17575. I will update the changelog and add a test case shortly!", "Hi @astropy/core team \uD83D\uDC4B\nI'd love to help close out issue #8860 (“enable both quantity_support and time_support in one go”). I saw PR #17979 is already addressing this great start!\nI can help with:\n\nAdding unit tests (both context manager and decorator use cases)\nUpdating the visualization documentation\nWould it be helpful if I take this on next?" ],

      "description" : "## Describe the bug\r\n\r\nThe [Icinga 2 API Event Stream documentation](https://icinga.com/docs/icinga-2/latest/doc/12-icinga2-api/#event-streams) states that the required `queue` parameter used to subscribe to the Event Stream must have an \"[u]nique queue name [and] [m]ultiple HTTP clients can use the same queue as long as they use the same event types and filter\".\r\n\r\nHowever, currently there is no functionality bound to the `queue` parameter next to a check for its presence.\r\nhttps://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/blob/2c9117b4f71e00b2072e7dbe6c4ea4e48c882a87/lib/remote/eventshandler.cpp#L81-L86\r\n\r\nIt seems like it's logic was removed in #7088, especially 81713d0509e5c686a4d038a237f367d438703120. Within this PR, the change regarding `queue` was [noted](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/pull/7088#issuecomment-480358802), but no further decisions were made.\r\n\r\n## To Reproduce\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI would expect the documentation to match the actual logic.\r\n\r\nAs I recently started using the Event Stream API a lot, I relied on the documented behavior, but, fortunately, did not ran in any errors - or at least non I know of. Thus, if the uniqueness constraint is not enforced anyway, maybe drop the whole parameter or change the code again to match the documented restrictions. As I myself do not know Icinga 2's internal well enough, I cannot say what would be best.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n## Your Environment\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nn/a",

      "description" : "## Problem\n\nCurrently, epsilon values are hardcoded throughout the HLSL shader codebase with various precision levels (1e-4, 1e-5, 1e-6, 1e-8, 1e-10), making maintenance difficult and potentially introducing inconsistencies within similar mathematical contexts.\n\n## Analysis\n\n### Current Epsilon Distribution:\n- **1e-6f**: 7 occurrences (6 in BRDF visibility functions + 1 in Diffuse_OrenNayar)\n- **1e-5**: 12+ occurrences (most common - PBR dot products, thresholds)\n- **1e-4**: 8 occurrences (lighting radius/distance checks, geometric tests)\n- **1e-8**: 2 occurrences (specialized - glints ellipse ratios)\n- **1e-10**: 4 occurrences (spherical harmonics weight normalization)\n\n### Mathematical Contexts Identified:\n\n#### 1. Division Protection (Current: 1e-6f)\nUsed in BRDF visibility functions to prevent division by zero:\n```hlsl\nreturn rcp(max(Vis_SmithV * Vis_SmithL, 1e-6f));\n```\n**Files:** package/Shaders/Common/BRDF.hlsli\n\n#### 2. Dot Product Clamping (Current: 1e-5)\nEnsures lighting terms don't go to zero:\n```hlsl\nfloat NdotL = clamp(dot(N, L), 1e-5, 1);\nfloat NdotV = saturate(abs(dot(N, V)) + 1e-5);\n```\n**Files:** package/Shaders/Common/PBR.hlsli, various feature shaders\n\n#### 3. Distance/Radius Thresholds (Current: 1e-4)\nUsed for geometric and lighting distance checks:\n```hlsl\nfloat distance = max(length(lightVector), 1e-4);\n```\n**Files:** Various lighting feature shaders\n\n#### 4. Specialized Precision (Current: 1e-8, 1e-10)\n- **1e-8**: Glints ellipse ratio calculations\n- **1e-10**: Spherical harmonics weight normalization\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nAdd domain-specific epsilon constants to Math.hlsli using #define to match current HLSL constant practices:\n\n```hlsl\n// Domain-specific epsilon values for numerical stability\n#define EPSILON_DIVISION    1e-6f    // For rcp() division protection\n#define EPSILON_DOT_CLAMP   1e-5f    // For NdotL/NdotV clamping\n#define EPSILON_DISTANCE    1e-4f    // For distance/radius thresholds\n#define EPSILON_GLINTS      1e-8f    // For glints calculations\n#define EPSILON_WEIGHT_SUM  1e-10f   // For weight normalization\n```\n\n## Files Requiring Updates\n\nBased on analysis, the following files contain hardcoded epsilon values that should be replaced:\n\n- package/Shaders/Common/BRDF.hlsli (1e-6f → EPSILON_DIVISION)\n- package/Shaders/Common/PBR.hlsli (1e-5 → EPSILON_DOT_CLAMP)\n- features/DynamicCubemaps/Shaders/DynamicCubemaps/DynamicCubemaps.hlsli (0.00001 → EPSILON_DOT_CLAMP)\n- features/Skylighting/Shaders/Skylighting/Skylighting.hlsli (1e-10 → EPSILON_WEIGHT_SUM)\n- features/ScreenSpaceGI/Shaders/ScreenSpaceGI/ScreenSpaceGI.hlsli (1e-4 → EPSILON_DISTANCE)\n- features/TerrainBlending/Shaders/TerrainBlending/TerrainBlending.hlsli (1e-4 → EPSILON_DISTANCE)\n- Various other feature shader files\n\n## Benefits\n\n1. **Consistency**: Same epsilon values used for identical mathematical purposes\n2. **Maintainability**: Single location to adjust epsilon values if needed\n3. **Documentation**: Clear intent through descriptive constant names\n4. **Standards Compliance**: Uses #define convention matching existing HLSL constants\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n- Different epsilon values serve mathematically distinct purposes with different sensitivity requirements\n- Performance impact is zero - different epsilon values have no measurable performance cost on modern GPUs\n- Domain-specific precision is necessary to avoid either visible artifacts or unnecessary precision loss\n\n## Related\n\n- PR #1226: Added NaN prevention checks to BRDF visibility functions using 1e-6f values\n- Discussion in PR #1226 comment thread about epsilon standardization\n\nBacklinks:\n- PR: https://github.com/doodlum/skyrim-community-shaders/pull/1226\n- Comment: https://github.com/doodlum/skyrim-community-shaders/pull/1226#issuecomment-discussion",

After a detailed investigation, Here is a little suggestion maybe can help.\nThe root cause is not in the MCP JAM Inspector app’s frontend or proxy, but rather in how the backend of your mcp tool server generates the JSON schema for parameters defined as `Annotated[Optional[str], Field(...)] = None`.\n\n### What’s Happening\n\n- The backend generates a schema for `Optional[str]` using `Annotated` that looks like:\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"name\": {\n        \"anyOf\": [{ \"type\": \"string\" }, { \"type\": \"null\" }],\n        \"default\": null,\n        \"description\": \"Your name\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n- The frontend UI interprets this as a complex type, resulting in the parameter being wrapped as `{ \"name\": { \"name\": \"test string\" } }` instead of `{ \"name\": \"test string\" }`.\n- This causes Pydantic validation errors and prevents tools using this pattern from being testable via the MCP JAM interface.\n\n### Why This Isn’t a Frontend Bug\n\n- The frontend simply renders forms and serializes parameters based on the schema it receives from the backend.\n- The proxy does not modify the request payloads.\n- The issue is with the schema generation, not with how the UI sends or the proxy forwards the data.\n\n### How to Fix or Work Around\n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  Define your parameter as `name: str | None = Field(default=None, description=\"...\")` (or, for older Python, `Optional[str] = Field(default=None, description=\"...\")`).\n- This produces a simpler schema (`type: [\"string\", \"null\"]`) that the UI will treat as a plain string (or null), and will serialize as `{ \"name\": \"test string\" }`.\n- If you must use `Annotated`, ensure your backend (Pydantic/FastAPI) is up to date, as newer versions may handle this more gracefully.\n\n---\n\nI'd be glad in hear your comments about this suggestion and also I could check that you solved this with a similar option that is removing the optional and use str with a default value that works too. If you think that this solve your issue please let me know for close it." ],

It natively supports MCP via `MCPTool` and can interoperate with both `mcpgateway-wrapper` and SSE/HTTP transports.\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDCCD Location of the Problem\n\n> Suggested location: `docs/docs/using/agents/beeai.md`  \n> Also update: `.pages` in `docs/docs/using/agents/` to include `beeai.md`\n\nPage: https://ibm.github.io/mcp-context-forge/using/agents/bee/\n---\n\n### ✏️ Type of Issue\n\n* [x] Missing client documentation\n* [x] New integration support\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDCA1 Suggested Fix or Clarification\n\nFollow the style used in `claude-desktop.md` and other client entries. Include:\n\n- Brief overview of BeeAI Framework\n- MCP integration via `MCPTool`\n- Sample usage with `mcpgateway-wrapper`\n- Optional section for SSE/WebSocket (if BeeAI supports it)\n- Tips for configuring tool discovery\n- Links to BeeAI official documentation\n\nInclude both stdio and REST variants for completeness.\n\n---\n\n### \uD83E\uDDE9 Additional Notes\n\nBeeAI supports observability, custom memory layers, and multi-LLM routing-consider noting how Gateway features like caching or SSE streams complement those workflows.\n",

Specifically there are three strings that explain Wikidata to the user, each of which are hard coded in English. We actually already have the localizations of these texts, they just haven't been applied :) They can be found in `keyboard.not_in_wikidata.explanation_1`, `keyboard.not_in_wikidata.explanation_2` and `keyboard.not_in_wikidata.explanation_3` as far as i18n keys are concerned :)\n\nAssigning you now!

      "repositoryName" : "elizaOS/eliza",
      "description" : "# Migrate remaining CLI input methods to use @clack/prompts for consistency\n\n## \uD83C\uDFAF Summary\n\nCurrently, the CLI uses a mix of input libraries (`inquirer`, Bun's global `prompt()`, and `@clack/prompts`). We should standardize on `@clack/prompts` for a consistent user experience and better styling across all CLI interactions.\n\n## \uD83D\uDCCB Current State\n\nMost of the CLI already uses `@clack/prompts` properly, but there are **2 main files** still using other input methods:\n\n### 1. `src/utils/plugin-creator.ts` - Using `inquirer` \uD83D\uDCE6\n\nThis file has multiple `inquirer.prompt()` calls that need to be migrated:\n\n- **Plugin specification collection** (~line 172-290):\n  - Plugin name input\n  - Plugin description input  \n  - Plugin features input\n  - Component selection (checkbox)\n  - Action names input\n  - Provider names input\n  - Evaluator names input\n  - Service names input\n\n### 2. `scripts/generate-unit-tests.ts` - Using global `prompt()` \uD83D\uDD27\n\n- **Test generation confirmation** (~line 165):\n  ```typescript\n  const answer = prompt('Generate tests? (y/n): ');\n  ```\n\n## ✨ Benefits of Migration\n\n1. **Consistent UX** - All CLI interactions will have the same look and feel\n2. **Better styling** - Clack provides superior visual design and animations\n3. **Better error handling** - Clack has built-in cancellation handling\n4. **Reduced dependencies** - Can remove `inquirer` from package.json\n5. **Type safety** - Better TypeScript integration\n\n## \uD83D\uDD27 Implementation Examples\n\n### For `plugin-creator.ts`:\n\n**Before (inquirer):**\n```typescript\nconst answers = await inquirer.prompt([\n  {\n    type: 'input',\n    name: 'name',\n    message: 'Plugin name (without \"plugin-\" prefix):',\n    validate: (input: string) => input.length > 0 || 'Plugin name is required'\n  }\n]);\n```\n\n**After (clack):**\n```typescript\nconst name = await clack.text({\n  message: 'Plugin name (without \"plugin-\" prefix):',\n  validate: (input) => input.length > 0 ? undefined : 'Plugin name is required'\n});\n\nif (clack.isCancel(name)) {\n  clack.cancel('Operation cancelled.');\n  process.exit(0);\n}\n```\n\n### For `generate-unit-tests.ts`:\n\n**Before:**\n```typescript\nconst answer = prompt('Generate tests? (y/n): ');\n```\n\n**After:**\n```typescript\nconst answer = await clack.confirm({\n  message: 'Generate tests?',\n  initialValue: true\n});\n\nif (clack.isCancel(answer)) {\n  console.log('Cancelled.');\n  return;\n}\n```\n\n## ✅ Reference Files (Already Using Clack)\n\nThese files are already properly implemented and serve as good examples:\n- `src/commands/create/actions/creators.ts`\n- `src/commands/create/index.ts`\n- `src/commands/env/actions/edit.ts`\n- `src/commands/publish/utils/validation.ts`\n- `src/utils/cli-prompts.ts`\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Replace all `inquirer.prompt()` calls in `plugin-creator.ts` with clack equivalents\n- [ ] Replace global `prompt()` call in `generate-unit-tests.ts` with clack\n- [ ] Remove `inquirer` dependency from `package.json` if no longer used elsewhere\n- [ ] Ensure all prompts handle cancellation properly (ctrl+c)\n- [ ] Test plugin creation flow works identically to current behavior\n- [ ] Test unit test generation script works identically to current behavior\n- [ ] Maintain existing validation logic and error messages\n- [ ] Update any related TypeScript types if needed\n\n## \uD83C\uDFAF Priority\n\n**Medium** - This improves developer experience and code consistency but doesn't affect core functionality.\n\n## \uD83D\uDCA1 Implementation Notes\n\n- The `generate-unit-tests.ts` part would be a good **beginner-friendly** task\n- The `plugin-creator.ts` part is more complex due to multiple sequential prompts\n- Consider breaking this into two separate PRs if needed\n- Make sure to test the checkbox selection for component types in plugin creation\n\n---\n\n**Note**: The majority of the CLI already uses clack properly - this is just cleaning up the last few stragglers to ensure complete consistency across the entire CLI experience.",

This is personal opinion however I believe snapshottest's approach of auto-creating the snapshots when missing is problematic. Imagine if you've written a number of new test cases and forget to create the relevant snapshots. If you push up your changes to your version control system and your CI system runs the test suite, with auto-create functionality, the tests will pass. This gives a false sense of confidence in the test suite. For all you know, the generated snapshot could be different every CI run.\r\n\r\nSyrupy's stance is that a missing snapshot is no different from a non-matching snapshot. Syrupy has no way of knowing that you've just written a new test case and so we expect a snapshot not to exist, vs. a test case has been renamed disconnecting it from the snapshot file, or the dev forgot to commit the snapshot artifacts to git when pushing up their branch for CI to run.", "why not use a CI option to throw on missing tests like jest does? ", "I'm open to that idea. I'd still want it to be opt-in though.", "I would also like to add a vote for this, a team member just added syrupy to one of our repos but previously we have just done this manually.\nIn those implementations, we always set it up so if the comparison file is missing, it generates it and then fails the test with an Error message stating it has created the file.\nThe next run would then pass.\n\nThis means that if it was missing due to not being committed or some other reason, it should still fail in CI. But yes makes it a lot easier to update the expectations from within an ide \uD83D\uDC4D \n\nOn that note, it would also be great if it is opt-in, if it was possible through a config file or env var. I think it would be possible to set the flag in the IDE but it would be nicer to not have to mess with pycharm settings to turn that behaviour on.\n\nThanks" ],

      "comments" : [ "Hey Seaders, thanks for your Issue!\n\n---\n\n### Recommendation\n\nMy recommendation is to keep your two declaration files separate. This approach makes your content declarations more maintainable and flexible, especially if you plan to use the visual editor.\n\n```ts\nimport { type DeclarationContent } from 'intlayer';\n\nconst overviewContent = {\n  key: 'overview',\n  content: {\n    header: 'Do all this awesome stuff with ',\n    subHeader: ['With ', \" you'll be even more awesome!\"],\n  },\n} satisfies DeclarationContent;\n\nexport default overviewContent;\n```\n\n```tsx\nimport { useIntlayer } from 'next-intlayer'; // or react-intlayer\nimport { type FC } from 'react';\n\nexport const YourComponent: FC = () => {\n  const { brandName, brandNameShort } = useIntlayer('app');\n  const { header, subHeader } = useIntlayer('overview');\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>\n        {header}\n        {brandName}\n      </h1>\n      <h2>\n        {subHeader[0]}\n        {brandNameShort}\n        {subHeader[1]}\n      </h2>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```\n\n### Alternative: Importing One Content File into Another\n\nIf you'd like to use TypeScript declaration files, an alternative is to import one content file into the other.\n\nHere’s an example:\n\n```ts\nimport { type DeclarationContent } from 'intlayer';\nimport appContent from './app.content';\n\nconst overviewContent = {\n  key: 'overview',\n  content: {\n    header: `Do all this awesome stuff with ${appContent.content.brandName}`,\n    subHeader: `With ${appContent.content.brandNameShort}, you'll be even more awesome!`,\n  },\n} satisfies DeclarationContent;\n\nexport default overviewContent;\n```\n\nIt will works properly, but the limitation of this approach is its compatibility with the visual editor for your `overviewContent` content declaration file. The editor will interpret `Do all this awesome stuff with Other Detail: Company Name` as a single string fully declared in your `overviewContent` declaration file. The visual editor does not interpret nested declaration for now.\n\n### Alternative: Using Component Logic\n\nAnother option is to call your content as a string using `.value` and replace placeholders with JavaScript's `replace` function.\n\n```tsx\nimport { useIntlayer } from 'next-intlayer'; // or react-intlayer\nimport { type FC } from 'react';\n\nexport const YourComponent: FC = () => {\n  const { brandName, brandNameShort } = useIntlayer('app');\n  const { header, subHeader } = useIntlayer('overview');\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>{header.value.replace('%%{app.brandName}%%', brandName.value)}</h1>\n      <h2>\n        {subHeader.value.replace(\n          '%%{app.brandNameShort}%%',\n          brandNameShort.value\n        )}\n      </h2>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nHowever, this approach sacrifices the benefits of the `IntlayerNode` (type returned by objects like `brandName`, `brandNameShort`, `header`, or `subHeader`). These types enable features such as displaying the content selector within the visual editor.\n\n### Content Nesting\n\nI know that **i18next** offers a similar feature called [`nesting`](https://www.i18next.com/translation-function/nesting). Would this be a feature you'd like to see in Intlayer? If so, and if there’s enough interest from others, let me know. I’d be happy to add it to the roadmap.\n\n---\n\n### Updated Visual Editor Documentation\n\nRegarding the visual editor: A new documentation has been released since Intlayer v4. The previous visual editor have been slitted into two tools :\n- [Intlayer visual editor (for locale declaration files)](https://intlayer.org/doc/concept/editor)\n- [Intlayer CMS (for distant dictionaries)](https://intlayer.org/doc/concept/cms)\n\nBecause of a big refactor regarding the approach, the visual editor will be released in the coming days with version 4.1.0. Meanwhile, we are still working on improvements related to the CMS, which will be fully available next weeks.", "I don't love option one because if `brandName` comes first in one language, we'd need to have an empty entry first, then `brandName`, then the second entry.  I think I'll probably go with option 2 until I get the visual editor working fully right at least, but i18n's nesting does look the most ideal solution (but also definitely the most complex one too, unfortunately).\n\nOne way or another, thanks so much for the comprehensive response, and, overall your work on this, it's massively appreciated.", "Hi @seaders !\n\nJust to communicate the release of [nesting](https://intlayer.org/doc/concept/content/nesting) feature sice the v5! \n\nI hope it will match your needs", "I FINALLY got around to this @aymericzip thanks so much for your work on this, it really is great and appreciated.\n\nI think? I'm using it correctly, but I did find one issue where I'm not sure if it's my incorrect usage.\n\nUsing this dictionary code,\n\n```\nimport { nest, type Dictionary } from \"intlayer\"\n\nconst brandNameShort = nest(\"app\", \"brandNameShort\")\n\nexport default {\n  key: \"overview\",\n  content: {\n    publishHeader: (\n      <>\n        Publish your product listings in the {brandNameShort} Mobile Web\n        Application or in the {brandNameShort} Chrome Extension\n      </>\n    ),\n    brandNameShort\n  }\n} satisfies Dictionary\n```\n\nand this view code,\n\n```\n  const { brandNameShort } = useIntlayer(\"app\")\n  const overview = useIntlayer(\"overview\")\n  console.log(\"overview\", overview)\n\n  return (\n      <h2>{brandNameShort}</h2>\n      <h2>{overview.brandNameShort}</h2>\n      <h2>{overview.publishHeader}</h2>\n  )\n```\n\nThe correct brand name is shown under \"brandNameShort\", coming from the app dictionary, \"overview.brandNameShort\", coming, nested, from the overview dictionary, but for \"overview.publishHeader\", I get\n\n> Publish your product listings in the Mobile Web Application or in the Chrome Extension\n\nAgain, not totally sure if this is by design or not, but I just thought I'd point it out to you.  Thanks again!", "Hey @seaders! Thanks for the feedback!\n\nMaybe have a look to the [insert function](https://intlayer.org/doc/concept/content/insertion)\n\nBut the combinaison of nesting + insertion + react node is not supported for now\n\nA way to fix it\n \n```ts\nimport { nest, insert, type Dictionary } from \"intlayer\"\n\nexport default {\n  key: \"overview\",\n  content: {\n    publishHeader: insert(\"Publish your product listings in the {{brandNameShort}} Mobile Web. Application or in the {{brandNameShort}} Chrome Extension\"),\n    brandNameShort: nest(\"app\", \"brandNameShort\")\n  }\n} satisfies Dictionary\n```\n\n```tsx\n  const { brandNameShort, publishHeader } = useIntlayer(\"overview\")\n\n  return (\n     <>\n        <h2>{brandNameShort}</h2>\n        <h2>\n           {publishHeader({\n              brandNameShort: brandNameShort.value\n           })}\n       </h2>\n    </>\n  )\n```\n\nWe implemented this function something like one month ago based on your feedback.

I'm always frustrated when -->\r\n\r\nWe have enabled [strict types](https://www.phptutorial.net/php-tutorial/php-strict_types/) already in https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/pull/1350, however this lead to issues like https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/issues/1435. It is an example of what can happen, if type casting goes wrong.\r\n\r\nNote generally, if we have strict types, we should also declare what types we use, just as other programming languages. A discussion of advantages of strict typing vs loose (or no) typing (at all, what PHP did before) goes beyond the scope of this issue, but in short:\r\n> Type hinting in method parameters or class properties is very useful and it helps you catch type errors before you run your code. \r\n\r\nhttps://dev.to/rocksheep/the-way-stricttypes-works-in-php-eb7\r\nMore here: https://dev.to/robdwaller/how-php-type-declarations-actually-work-1mm5\r\n\r\nAs [PHP nowadays supports type hints/type declarations](https://stackoverflow.com/a/29967975/5008962) as of PHP v7\r\n\r\n## The solution\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. Pitch your solution! What would happen, if we don't implement this? -->\r\n\r\n* [x] first of all, check, if strict types are enabled in all files (excluding dependencies of course)\r\n* [ ] step by step, convert the code [and add type declarations](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.declarations.php) to the functions, both for arguments as well as\r\n* [ ] test that everything still works as wanted, both via unit tests and manual tests\r\n* [ ] AFAIK, you can then remove the PHPDoc parts that only explain the types (like return values or arguments). But let's test that they appear the same in [PHPDoc](https://phpdoc.org/).\r\n\r\nSome hints:\r\n* One can use the existing PHPdoc as a very good reference, at best it works the same and the documented type is really what the runtime really wants. However, there may be edge cases or cases where it is not \"quite right\" (as obviously it was never enforced by the [PHP] interpreter), so take it with a grain of salt!\r\n* Especially for contributors: Start with one file! Or generally, take it step by step. You can easily do multiple PRs and start small by converting only one or two files to stricter types. It can be gradually done.\r\n\r\n## Alternatives\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered. -->\r\nLeave it as it is, it should stay compatible as PHP is very backwards-compatible. However, modern code and many other programming languages embrace type casting/strict/strong(er) typing, so this is IMHO a good way, we should follow.\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\r\n* Bonus: Maybe we find a linter tool or can configure sth. to alert us about missing type declarations in the future? This would help:\r\n  1. to discover missing declarations\r\n  2. to enforce a new coding style that requires type declarations for PHP code\r\n\r\nAlso, as it is a feature starting with PHP 7, but which has been gradually enhanced, we obviously need to make sure it works with all supported PHP versions:\r\nhttps://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/blob/d23bb748d45bb8cde8f3737b632d7ddd6a383e35/lib/Controller.php#L32-L37\r\n\r\nEdit: corrected canonical location for minimum supported PHP version lookup in PrivateBin internally",

The field for entering the password is virtually no longer available and recognizable as such.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d619e965-65f2-4f1f-888d-904df9938365)\n\n\nIf the width is <100 px, the burger menu is displayed:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4407cd35-54f1-4eb4-a192-2605209e5cef)\n\n## The solution\nI don't know to what extent the suggestions can be implemented at all, but my suggestion would be to display the input fields (password, expiration & format) with a fixed width. If the screen width becomes smaller, the settings on the right-hand side (day-nightmode, language & theme) should move to the line below right-aligned (as with the bootsrap theme). If the display becomes even smaller, the other settings follow and also move to the line below (left-aligned). As an example of how it looks with bootstrap when the display width is < 1600 px:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4fcd05c4-fa37-4817-98b8-7ea37c8dd437)\n\nIf the display width becomes even smaller < 1400 px:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb8030df-d798-44f0-8d86-8c4ac64c2cf4)\n\nThe burger menu appears at a width < approx. 770 px:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f113384d-a7d2-471b-b777-5ddca0250b44)\n\n\n\n## Alternatives\n\nNo idea, leave everything as it is :-)\n\n## Additional context\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\n",

Minimum width for password, expiration & format is certainly a good start. An alternative would be to hide some of the lesser used options in a drop-down.

Please explain\n\n#6882 created a cache that sped up circuit construction if only \"append\" (or equivalent \"insert\" at end w/ EARLIEST strategy) was used. If other types of \"insert\", \"delete\", or any other circuit mutation was used (see instances of `_placement_cache = None`), the cache was simply deleted and subsequent mutations (including appends) fell back to the old \"check every moment\" algorithm.\n\n## Describe the solution you would prefer\n\nThere are probably some clever algorithms or data structures that could maintain the placement cache through more types of mutations. Or another option could be if the placement cache was deleted and subsequently the user calls a few \"appends\" in a row, to assume there are more coming and have some code that regenerates the placement cache a-priori. (It'd be nice to see some real-world use cases of large circuits that use mutations other than \"append\", to make sure any solution is optimizing the right thing).\n\n## How urgent is this for you? Is it blocking important work?\n\n<!-- Please choose one of the following options and remove the others -->\n**P3** – I'm not really blocked by it; it's an idea I'm proposing based on principle\n",

So, the current implementation of the wasmedge-ffmpeg plugin will also need to be modified.\n\n\n### Details\n\nThe following action items should be finished:\n\n- [ ] Update to the new ffmpeg version 7.1.1\n- [ ] Modify the implementation of wasmedge-ffmpeg\n- [ ] Ensure the CI passes for building and testing\n\n### Appendix\n\n_No response_",

      "description" : "### What happened?\r\n\r\nOK, so, I'm trying to train a Flux LoRa (Loha to be precise) with one additional embedding\r\nDuring training, samples look like they are really excellent, much more so than without the additional embedding, so this seems to be of great effect. \r\nHowever, in comfyui, i did not get results as good as in the samples (it looked very undertrained). While looking at the console output of comfy, here is what I see : \r\n\r\n> WARNING: shape mismatch when trying to apply embedding, embedding will be ignored 768 != 4096\r\n> WARNING: shape mismatch when trying to apply embedding, embedding will be ignored 768 != 4096\r\n> WARNING: shape mismatch when trying to apply embedding, embedding will be ignored 768 != 4096\r\n> WARNING: shape mismatch when trying to apply embedding, embedding will be ignored 768 != 4096\r\n\r\nOut of curiosity, I looked at the embedding in an Hex editor, since the files are small, well, it was worth a shot and it starts with some json data of what I suppose is the description of the binary data structure of the embedding:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"clip_g\": {\r\n        \"dtype\": \"BF16\",\r\n        \"shape\": [\r\n            4,\r\n            768\r\n        ],\r\n        \"data_offsets\": [\r\n            0,\r\n            6144\r\n        ]\r\n    },\r\n    \"t5\": {\r\n        \"dtype\": \"BF16\",\r\n        \"shape\": [\r\n            4,\r\n            4096\r\n        ],\r\n        \"data_offsets\": [\r\n            6144,\r\n            38912\r\n        ]\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nSo, this makes me wonder if there is an issue with the way the embedding is written to disk since Flux is supposed to be CLIP_L+T5, whereas here, I see CLIP_G+T5 ?\r\n\r\nI trained the same dataset on SDXL to see how the clip_l section looked like and it clearly states \"clip_l\".\r\nIn the SDXL database, the clip_g dimension was [4,1280] while the clip_l dimension was [4,768]\r\n\r\nthe dtype was F32 instead of BF16 and the offsets were doubled, but it was consistent with the output data type of the files I forgot to change from FLOAT32 to BF16 in this second run.\r\n\r\nI tried to change in the Hex editor clip_g to clip_l, but comfy simply ignored the embedding.\r\nI know the embedding must have some kind of effect since running the same seed without the embedding is even worse.\r\n\r\nNow, can someone confirm that, this embedding is actually properly formatted and therefore, there is a bug in the comfyui parser of the embedding, or did I actually found a bug in OneTrainer ?\r\n\r\nThank you, this piece of software is awesome !\r\n\r\n\r\n### What did you expect would happen?\r\n\r\nSame quality between samples during training and comfyui output\r\n\r\n### Relevant log output (this is from Comfyui, just to be clear)\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nWARNING: shape mismatch when trying to apply embedding, embedding will be ignored 768 != 4096\r\nWARNING: shape mismatch when trying to apply embedding, embedding will be ignored 768 != 4096\r\nWARNING: shape mismatch when trying to apply embedding, embedding will be ignored 768 != 4096\r\nWARNING: shape mismatch when trying to apply embedding, embedding will be ignored 768 != 4096\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Output of `pip freeze`\r\n\r\n_No response_",

To quote one of the former devs: \"I find masked training is best when you've got a piece that trains harder than everything else in the image and you're trying to balance it. Does that apply to you? T\"", "I would still be interested in having this. Say you captioned image \"backgrounds\" (not the people behavior and appearance in it, but the setting they are in, landscape etc). Then it would make sense to generate an \"inverted\" mask with rembg to make it pick up on those parts of the image much faster. I guess one could work out a batch-workflow using imagemagick -negate or something similar to get the same effect, but it would be so much easier and less error prone this way." ],

Please explain\n\nParameterization requires a bunch of boilerplate (`_is_parameterized_`, `_parameter_names_`, `_resolve_parameters_`, all of which just check / replace the specified member variables). It seems like something a decorator could handle well.\n\n## Describe the solution you would prefer\n\nIt'd be great if in #5985, the solution could just be \"add the decorator to `QasmUGate`\", something like \n\n```python\n@parameterizable(\"theta\", \"phi\", \"lmda\")\nclass QasmUGate(ops.Gate):\n```\n\n## How urgent is this for you? Is it blocking important work?\n\n<!-- Please choose one of the following options and remove the others -->\n**P3** – I'm not really blocked by it; it's an idea I'm proposing based on principle\n\n## Process Note\n\nFor anyone wanting to take this issue, it's probably worth a mini [RFC](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/main/docs/dev/rfc_process.md) and finding a maintainer (not me) to sponsor it before starting work (assuming this even gets to triage/accepted state). While it's probably below the \"RFC Required\" bar, I think there are enough variables, that having an approved design would be beneficial. (Some things that come to mind: What happens if only some fields are parameterizable? Can/should it work both with dataclasses and with non-dataclasses? Can the implementations be overridden in classes it's applied to? How to apply it in gate class hierarchies (e.g. at the EigenGate level or at each subtype?) Does it interact with mypy typing in any way or are type declarations independent? What's the best way to test it? Is it worth going back and retrofitting existing gates into this model?)",

(Can be useful for custom beacon effects)\n\n[Handshake](https://papermc.io/javadocs/index.html?com/destroystokyo/paper/event/player/PlayerHandshakeEvent.html) Event\n- This event is fired during a player handshake. (Can be useful for some stuff)\n- **WARNING: TAMPERING WITH THIS EVENT CAN BE DANGEROUS**\n\n[PlayerArmorChange](https://papermc.io/javadocs/index.html?com/destroystokyo/paper/event/player/PlayerArmorChangeEvent.html) Event\n- Called when the player themselves change their armor items  (Can be useful for detecting armor for some custom enchant related stuff)\n\n[View distance](https://papermc.io/javadocs/org/bukkit/entity/Player.html)\n- Pretty much changing the view distance of a player (Can be useful to reduce lag)\n\n[Set arrow stuck](https://papermc.io/javadocs/org/bukkit/entity/Player.html)\n- Changing the amount of arrows stuck in the player (Can be useful to become a porcupine, crash your fps, and remove those arrows that are stuck on to you.)\n\n[PlayerUseUnknownEntity](https://papermc.io/javadocs/index.html?com/destroystokyo/paper/event/player/PlayerUseUnknownEntityEvent.html) event\n- called when a player interacts with a client sided/fake entity\n- vanilla Skript now has client-side blocks so this might be useful\n\n[Tab Header/Footer](https://papermc.io/javadocs/org/bukkit/entity/Player.html)\n- Can set the header/footer of the tab list.\n\n[Protocol Version](https://papermc.io/javadocs/index.html?org/bukkit/entity/Player.html)\n- Can get the protocol version number that the player is currently using.\n- List of Protocol Version numbers, https://wiki.vg/Protocol_version_numbers\n\n[PlayerReadyArrowEvent](https://papermc.io/javadocs/com/destroystokyo/paper/event/player/PlayerReadyArrowEvent.html) Event\n- Called when a player is firing a bow and the server is choosing an arrow to use.\n- Can be good to combine with the shoot event.\n\n[Actionbar](https://papermc.io/javadocs/org/bukkit/entity/Player.html)\n- Can be used to send an action bar to the player\n\n[UnknownCommandEvent](https://papermc.io/javadocs/org/bukkit/event/command/UnknownCommandEvent.html)\n- Can be used to change the message of a undefined command.\n\n[SpongeAbsorbEvent](https://papermc.io/javadocs/org/bukkit/event/block/SpongeAbsorbEvent.html)\n- **(This event was added in 1.13.2)**\n- Called when a sponge absorbs water from the world. \n- Can be spammy when you have to debug it\n- This event won't change it back to 1.7 sponge mechanics, since the sponge will end up not absorbing the water around it.\n\n[InventoryCloseEvent Reason](https://papermc.io/javadocs/org/bukkit/event/inventory/InventoryCloseEvent.html)\n- Returns the reason why the inventory got closed\n\n[Here's Johnny](https://papermc.io/javadocs/org/bukkit/entity/Vindicator.html)\n- When in Johnny mode the Vindicator will be hostile to any kind of mob, except for evokers, ghasts, illusioners and other vindicators. It will even be hostile to vexes. All mobs, except for endermites, phantoms, guardians, slimes and magma cubes, will try to attack the vindicator in return.\n\n<!--- A clear and concise description of the suggestion --->\n##",

You're absolutely right about the XPU support limitations. The main areas that need updates for full XPU support are:\n\n1. The [`autocast` function](https://docs.ultralytics.com/reference/utils/torch_utils/#ultralytics.utils.torch_utils.autocast) in `torch_utils.py` currently only handles CUDA and CPU devices\n2. The [`check_amp` function](https://docs.ultralytics.com/reference/utils/checks/#ultralytics.utils.checks.check_amp) returns `False` for non-CUDA devices\n3. The [`select_device` function](https://docs.ultralytics.com/reference/utils/torch_utils/#ultralytics.utils.torch_utils.select_device) needs XPU device handling for auto-batch functionality\n\nYour PR would be very welcome!

The attached files provide a great foundation - just make sure to test the device detection logic handles edge cases like `device=\"xpu:0\"` vs `device=\"xpu\"` consistently across all the modified functions.\n\nWe'd be happy to review and merge XPU support once it's submitted as a PR. Thanks for taking the initiative to get this working!", "@glenn-jocher I am sitting behind a corporate proxy that makes any outside update difficult.  If someone makes the requested changes, I can always test it out with the hardware available to me. Will have to explore internally to see if update is possible.\n\nIn the trainer.py is this a good option? If not, I am seeing a warning, but no other issues. I don't know if xpu supports GradScaler, but the code doesn't produce warning or error. The below logic can avoid a warning for XPU case, but might work in future if it is supported.\n\nLine 290\n\n        if torch.cuda.is_available():\n            self.scaler = (\n                torch.amp.GradScaler(\"cuda\", enabled=self.amp) if TORCH_2_4 else torch.cuda.amp.GradScaler(enabled=self.amp)\n            )\n        elif torch.xpu.is_available():\n            self.scaler = (torch.amp.GradScaler(self.device, enabled=self.amp))\n\nThe select_device method in torch_utils.py needs modification. The variable device is used interchangeably making it difficult. If we give device=0, what does it mean. It could be a GPU or XPU. At present I am passing device=\"xpu\" which limits its usage to one card. There are machines with more than one card.\n\nThere could be a machine with CPU, iGPU, NPU, dGPU (NVIDIA), dGPU (Intel called XPU), dGPU (AMD), and ASIC (Intel HPU) all in one machine. Checking logic like torch.cuda.is_available() or torch.xpu.is_available() or torch.cpu.is_available() will all return true because they are present in the system. This could lead to issues like user specifying device=0 which defaults to CUDA even though user might have selected XPU based on how the workload is running. If the user has done YOLO('yolov8l.pt').to(DEVICE), the DEVICE should be honored across the workflow logic. With what changes are proposed above, setting device=\"xpu\" or device=\"xpu:0\" should work. Selecting device=\"0\" on a XPU machine fails because it defaults to CUDA when it is not available. Multicard training needs further study because theoretically it should be same for CUDA or XPU.", "Thanks for the detailed analysis @azhuvath! I completely understand the corporate proxy constraints - that's a common challenge.\n\nYour GradScaler approach looks good, though I'd suggest checking `self.device.type == \"xpu\"` instead of `torch.xpu.is_available()` to ensure you're actually using an XPU device rather than just having XPU capability available.\n\nYou raise excellent points about the device selection complexity in multi-accelerator systems. The current logic in `select_device` does assume CUDA priority, which isn't ideal for XPU workflows. Your approach of explicitly passing `device=\"xpu\"` is the right pattern for now - it's clear and unambiguous.\n\nSince you're unable to submit PRs directly, perhaps @huahuadeliaoliao could incorporate your working changes into their planned PR? Your attached files provide a solid foundation and the performance results (15x over CPU, 2.5x with AMP) are compelling evidence this implementation works well.\n\nFor multi-XPU support, the pattern should indeed be similar to multi-GPU - handling device strings like `\"xpu:0,1\"` in the device parsing logic, though that can be a follow-up enhancement once basic XPU support is merged.", "@glenn-jocher I tested the changes on Intel Meteor Lake (MTL) iGPU (Integrated Graphics). It is working fine. So it should also work on Intel Lunar Lake (LNL) iGPU.

Your comprehensive testing across different Intel hardware (Max 1100, MTL iGPU) and the refined implementation looks excellent. The changes are well-structured and cover all the critical areas for robust XPU support.\n\nSince you've done the heavy lifting with testing and refinement but can't submit PRs directly, I'll work on getting these changes incorporated into the codebase. Your implementation provides a solid foundation for Intel XPU support across the entire Intel Xe graphics lineup.\n\nThe performance improvements you've documented (15x over CPU, 2.5x with AMP enabled) make this a valuable addition for the Intel GPU ecosystem.

The core logic for assembling the answer changed in recent updates, specifically in the `_run` method of `answer_node.py`, which now processes and merges template/user text and LLM output differently. This likely causes the LLM output to appear outside your custom tags, leaving the tag empty instead of wrapping the LLM output as before [[source]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/blob/37e19de7ab3d8c1ffd8dfd8b789ff52b47f981cb/api/core/workflow/nodes/answer/answer_node.py).\n\nThere’s no documentation or open issue directly tracking this, but similar regressions have happened before when output formatting or merging logic was refactored. If you need a workaround, try adjusting your template or node configuration to see if you can force the LLM output inside the tag, or temporarily revert to 1.4.3 if that’s feasible for your deployment. If you’re using structured output, double-check your schema and model compatibility, as recent changes in structured output handling have also caused related issues for some users [[source]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/20975).\n\nIf you need to track this for a future fix, keep an eye on changes to `answer_node.py` and related workflow node logic in upcoming releases.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

It seems that changed part only add a wrapper \"ArrayFileSegment\" of return files. I doubt if this will change the answer of my custom tag.", "<!-- Answer -->\nYou're correct—adding the ArrayFileSegment wrapper only affects how file outputs are handled and does not impact string outputs or the formatting of your custom tags in the answer node. The regression with your custom tag is more likely due to changes in how the answer node parses and merges templates and variables. Specifically, the answer is now assembled by splitting your template into text and variable chunks, then merging them, which can cause issues if the chunk boundaries don't align with your tags (for example, if you have a template like `<tag>{{#llm#}}</tag>`) [[source]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/blob/37e19de7ab3d8c1ffd8dfd8b789ff52b47f981cb/api/core/workflow/nodes/answer/answer_stream_generate_router.py).\n\nIf your tags are ending up empty, it's likely because the variable replacement logic is splitting the template in a way that separates the tag from the variable. This is unrelated to ArrayFileSegment and is instead a subtle change in the template parsing or merging logic. You might be able to work around this by adjusting your template so that the variable is not directly inside the tag, or by experimenting with different placements of your tags and variables. If you need to dig deeper, reviewing the logic in AnswerStreamGeneratorRouter and the template parsers (PromptTemplateParser, VariableTemplateParser) will show exactly how the chunks are split and merged.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

The frontend now uses a custom Rehype plugin that strips or alters any HTML tag that doesn't match the regex /^[a-z][a-z0-9]*$/i, converting it to plain text. This means custom tags (like `<tag>`) are no longer rendered as HTML elements, which is why your LLM output appears outside the tag or the tag appears empty in the UI, even though the backend (and debug panel) output is correct. This stricter sanitation was likely added for security reasons and is not documented as a breaking change, so it may not have been present or as strict in 1.4.3 [reference](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/blob/37e19de7ab3d8c1ffd8dfd8b789ff52b47f981cb/web/app/components/base/markdown/index.tsx).\n\nTo work around this, you can use only standard HTML tags supported by the renderer, or adjust your template to avoid custom tags. If you need custom tag support, you would need to patch the frontend markdown renderer to relax or remove this restriction.

I wanted to test before migrating to our main project and hence, i tried migrating to new third person c++ project. Only one problem i am getting is, in motion capture, character is moving up in the project i have migrated but its working fine in demo project. I am attaching the video and 1st clip is in new project (where mediapipe project is migrated into) and second clip is of demo project itself where its working normal. Please have a look of the video and guide us for a solution to prevent the character going up. Thank you\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ybo_WQdKIMIhCz8ZD49BvVl1Wmk_NBqN/view?usp=sharing\n",

      "description" : "### Brief Abstract\r\n(perhaps only when in a roam buffer), if `id` is selected as the link type in `org-insert-link`, offer completion over roam nodes (with `org-roam-node-read`) and insert a link to the relevant id.\r\n\r\n### Long Description\r\nI use org both with and without org-roam and I want a really easy, simple workflow. Basically, I *do* want completion on node names when I'm inserting links in roam buffers, but I *don't* want to have to remember that I'm in a roam buffer and therefore use a special keybinding for `org-roam-node-insert`. I just want to insert link with org and have it Just Work™.\r\n\r\nSo, like altering the link following behaviour (as roam [already does](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/blob/3782e88d50f83c5b9fbb4b10df71df3f37e27156/org-roam-id.el#L91)), set org's built-in completion to play nice with roam nodes.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Implementation (if any)\r\n```elisp\r\n(defun org-roam-id-complete (&optional initial-input filter-fn sort-fn require-match prompt)\r\n  \"Read an `org-roam-node', returning its id.\r\n\r\nAll args are passed to `org-roam-node-read'.\"\r\n  (concat\r\n   \"id:\"\r\n   (org-roam-node-id\r\n    (org-roam-node-read\r\n     initial-input filter-fn sort-fn require-match prompt))))\r\n\r\n(org-link-set-parameters \"id\" :complete #'org-roam-id-complete)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWould go [here](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/blob/3782e88d50f83c5b9fbb4b10df71df3f37e27156/org-roam-id.el#L92). I included passing the optional args incase this function is useful in other lisp in the future.\r\n\r\nThis could be augmented with a check of `org-roam-buffer-p` if we wanted to avoid linking outside of roam buffers. I'm not sure if this is relevant, because org doesn't have a default completion mechanism for `id` links, so this implementation doesn't shadow anything.\r\n\r\n(edit to add: happy to PR this if anyone thinks it's worth it)\r\n\r\n#### Possible extensions\r\nIt would be nice to set the title of the node as the default/suggested description for the link, but this doesn't seem possible in a way which doesn't have to account for every link type at once (see [here](https://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/27860/34394) and the docstring of `org-link-make-description-function`).\r\n\r\nFailing that, it might be a good idea to add the title to the history (or future history) of the relevant list, so that it can be easily pulled down as a description. This should be easy enough in the above function with `add-to-history`, but I don't know which list to add to. I could make the change work if I did though!\r\n\r\n### Please check the following:\r\n\r\n- [X] No similar feature requests\r\n",

      "description" : "### Is there an existing issue already for this feature request/idea?\n\n- [x] I have searched for an existing issue, and could not find anything. I believe this is a new feature request to be evaluated.\n\n### What problem is this feature going to solve? Why should it be added?\n\nImporting a db with pg_dump using a single worker is slow. There is also no easy hook for the `SELECT timescaledb_pre_restore();` and `SELECT timescaledb_post_restore();` functions.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nA common pattern is to split the job into pgdumps predata, data, and postdata stages. You generally want to use a single worker when copying the schema, many workers when copying the actual data, and at least one worker when applying constraints at the end depending on how fast that is. The current extra settings flag does not give you the control to do this.\n\nI'm willing to work on this feature. Looking at the existing codebase, this does look like a good first issue assuming prior experience with pg_dump, since the import section is fairly self-contained.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nRunning a shell script by piping to kubectl exec sh). This is pretty close to what we do now, since pg_dump/pg_restore is fairly independent of how it runs.\n\nOther options would be to have a CNPG-I plugin for other restore options like pgcopydb. Another is to not bother with any optimizations but to add six lines to  detect whether timescaledb is a preloaded extension and if so to run the  `SELECT timescaledb_pre_restore();` and `SELECT timescaledb_post_restore();` functions which are required to load the backup correctly, with no API changes and only a fix to import databases with a common extension.\n\n### Additional context\n\nExposing a good API for this is tricky and this is something I'd like a maintainer opinion on. \n\n### Backport?\n\nNo\n\n### Are you willing to actively contribute to this feature?\n\nYes\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct",

      "description" : "**Is there an existing issue for this?**\nI have searched the existing issues and checked the recent builds/commits\n\n**What would your feature do ?**\nImplement a versioned default settings system that allows changing default values for new users without affecting existing users who haven't explicitly set a preference. This feature would enable the team to improve the default user experience for new installations while respecting existing users' workflows.\n\n**Proposed workflow**\n1. Add a `defaultsByInstallVersion` field to SettingParams that tracks different defaults based on installation version:\n   ```typescript\n   {\n     id: 'Comfy.LinkRelease.Action',\n     defaultValue: LinkReleaseTriggerAction.CONTEXT_MENU,\n     defaultsByInstallVersion: {\n       '1.21.3': LinkReleaseTriggerAction.SEARCH_BOX,\n       '1.40.3': LinkReleaseTriggerAction.FUTURE_FEATURE\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. Store an `installedVersion` setting when a user first runs the application. For refernce how to do this, search how `Comfy.TutorialCompleted` setting is set. You may also need to update tests to set this value, unless a test case specifically wants to test things for a new user. Again just search how it is handled for `Comfy.TutorialCompleted`\n\n3. Installed versions can be found in systemStatsStore or as a global variable on window object. When getting a setting's default value:\n   - If user has `installedVersion` >= specified version, use the versioned default\n   - If user has no `installedVersion` (existing user), use the original `defaultValue`\n   - This ensures backward compatibility for existing users\n\n4. The setting store's `getDefaultValue` function would be updated to check `defaultsByInstallVersion` based on the user's installation version\n\n**Additional information**\nThis approach was discussed in PR #3652 as a solution for changing the default link release action from context menu to search box for new users only. The implementation would:\n- Maintain clean separation between user preferences and system defaults\n- Allow progressive enhancement of defaults without disrupting existing users\n- Provide a clear audit trail of when defaults changed\n- Support A/B testing of defaults in the future if needed\n\nRelated discussion: https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_frontend/pull/3652#issuecomment-2447681991",

      "comments" : [ "# :wave: Important: PLEASE READ :wave:\n\nThis issue has been labeled as a **good first issue** and is available for anyone to work on.\n\nIf this is your first time contributing to an open source project, some aspects of the development process may seem unusual, arcane, or some combination of both.\n\n1.  **You cannot \"claim\" issues.** People new to open source often want to \"claim\" or be assigned an issue before beginning work. The typical rationale is that people want to avoid wasted work in the event that someone else ends up working the issue. However, this practice is not effective in open source, as it often leads to \"issue squatting\", in which an individual asks to be assigned, is granted their request, and then never ends up working on the issue. Accordingly, you are encouraged to communicate your intent to address this issue, ideally by providing a rough outline as to how you plan to address the issue or asking clarifying questions, but, at the end of the day, we will take running code and rough consensus in order to move forward quickly.\n2.  **We have a very high bar for contributions.** We have very high standards for contributions and expect all contributions—whether new features, tests, or documentation—to be rigorous, thorough, and complete. Once a pull request is merged into stdlib, that contribution immediately becomes the collective responsibility of all maintainers of stdlib. When we merge code into stdlib, we are saying that we, the maintainers, commit to reviewing subsequent changes and making bugfixes to the code. Hence, in order to ensure future maintainability, this naturally leads to a higher standard of contribution.\n\nBefore working on this issue and opening a pull request, please read the project's [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md). These guidelines and the associated [development guide](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/docs/contributing/development.md) provide important information, including links to stdlib's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), license policy, and steps for setting up your local development environment.\n\nTo reiterate, we **strongly** encourage you to refer to our contributing guides **before** beginning work on this issue. Failure to follow our guidelines significantly decreases the likelihood that you'll successfully contribute to stdlib and may result in automatic closure of a pull request without review.\n\nSetting up your local development environment is a critical first step, as doing so ensures that automated development processes for linting, license verification, and unit testing can run prior to authoring commits and pushing changes. If you would prefer to avoid manual setup, we provide pre-configured [development containers](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/tree/develop/.devcontainer) for use locally or in GitHub Codespaces.\n\nWe place a high value on consistency throughout the stdlib codebase. We encourage you to closely examine other packages in stdlib and attempt to emulate the practices and conventions found therein.\n\n-   If you are attempting to contribute a new package, sometimes the best approach is to simply copy the contents of an existing package and then modify the minimum amount necessary to implement the feature (e.g., changing descriptions, parameter names, and implementation).\n-   If you are contributing tests, find a package implementing a similar feature and emulate the tests of that package.\n-   If you are updating documentation, examine several similar packages and emulate the content, style, and prose of those packages.\n\nIn short, the more effort you put in to ensure that your contribution looks and feels like stdlib—including variables names, bracket spacing, line breaks, etc—the more likely that your contribution will be reviewed and ultimately accepted. We encourage you to closely study the codebase **before** beginning work on this issue.\n\n:sparkles: Thank you again for your interest in stdlib, and we look forward to reviewing your future contributions. :sparkles:\n" ],

My DAG configs were: retries=1000, retry_delay=5 min (300 seconds), max_retry_delay=1h (3600 seconds). My DAG failed ~1000 times and after that Scheduler broke down. After that retries exceeded 1000 and stopped on 1017 retry attempt. \n\nI did my research on this problem and found that this happened due to formula **min_backoff = math.ceil(delay.total_seconds() * (2 ** (self.try_number - 1)))** in **taskinstance.py** file. So retry_exponential_backoff has no limit of try_number and during calculations it can overflow max Float value. So even if max_retry_delay is set formula is still calculating. And during calculations on very large retry number it crashes.\n\nPlease fix bug. \n\nI also did pull request with my possible solution:\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/48057\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/48051\n\nFrom Airflow logs:\n2024-12-09 02:16:39.825\tOverflowError: cannot convert float infinity to integer\n2024-12-09 02:16:39.825\t    min_backoff = int(math.ceil(delay.total_seconds() * (2 ** (self.try_number - 2))))\n2024-12-08 09:29:14.583\t[2024-12-08T06:29:14.583+0000] {scheduler_job_runner.py:705} INFO - Executor reports execution of mydag.spark_submit run_id=manual__2024-11-02T10:19:30.618008+00:00 exited with status up_for_retry for try_number 470\n\nConfigs: \n_with DAG(\n            dag_id=DAG_ID,\n            start_date=MYDAG_START_DATE,\n            schedule_interval=\"@daily\",\n            catchup=AIRFLOW_CATCHUP,\n            default_args={\n                'depends_on_past': True,\n                \"retries\": 1000,\n                \"retry_delay\": duration(minutes=5),\n                \"retry_exponential_backoff\": True,\n                \"max_retry_delay\": duration(hours=1),\n            },\n    ) as dag:_\n\n<img width=\"947\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3307b23-0307-4b4d-b968-3e1984fbe93c\" />\n<img width=\"1050\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f161329c-155c-4d92-b3b4-cf442d6ed036\" />\n\n### What you think should happen instead?\n\nMy pull request: \nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/48057\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/48051\n\n### How to reproduce\n\nUse configs from above.

This occurs in both desktop and iOS versions, but on desktop you can use \"Print to PDF\" as a workaround.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nPDFs with blob-type URLs: are typically generated upon user request (e.g., when clicking a button). My file is from an area reserved to registered users and I cannot share the URL.\n\n### Actual result\n\n- In the desktop version (I use Windows) the \"Save As\" command in context menu is disabled and CTRL+S does not work\n- On iOS, “Save to File” is missing from the share menu because the file is shared as link only.\n\n### Expected result\n\n- On desktop, the \"Save as\" command should be available, if possible. Other Chromium browsers have the same behavior as Brave, while Firefox can download the document normally.\n- On iOS, Safari can download the file because the share menu mode is “1 document and 1 link” and Save to File is available. Brave should probably implement this feature in the same way as Safari.\n\n### Reproduces how often\n\nEasily reproduced\n\n### Brave version\n\n1.78\n\n### Device/iOS version\n\niPhone, iOS 18.5\nWindows 11\n\n### Affected browser versions\n\n- [ ] latest AppStore\n- [ ] latest TestFlight\n- [ ] previous TestFlight\n\n### Reproducibility\n\n- [ ] with Brave Shields disabled\n- [ ] in the latest version of mobile Safari\n\n### Miscellaneous information\n\n_No response_",

This is the GMS change I made to make that work: https://github.com/dolthub/go-mysql-server/pull/3046, but I realized that this was breaking a bunch of tests in Dolt for reasons I didn't expect, so I reverted it shortly thereafter: https://github.com/dolthub/go-mysql-server/pull/3056\n\nChanging the output of SET by itself will break many changes test in Dolt. Unfortunately I was actually trying to fix this issue, which is about the shell printing the right updates, so that got all jumbled up which let to a deeper issue which is that the `dolt sql` shell doesn't have the right information to determine when to print the Query OK line. Specifically, mysql shell will not print any of them if it's executing statements in a batch.\n\nThis is best shown here:\n\n```\n$ echo \"create table t (i int); drop table t;\" | mysql -u root -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3306 mydb\n$ mysql -u root -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3306 mydb\nWelcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \\g.\nYour MySQL connection id is 9\nServer version: 8.0.33 Dolt\n\nCopyright (c) 2000, 2023, Oracle and/or its affiliates.\n\nOracle is a registered trademark of Oracle Corporation and/or its\naffiliates. Other names may be trademarks of their respective\nowners.\n\nType 'help;' or '\\h' for help. Type '\\c' to clear the current input statement.\n\nmysql> create table t (i int);\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> drop table t;\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql>\n```\n\nYou can see that the output of the first command is empty. MySQL client knows that you are not in an interactive terminal. `dolt sql` shell doesn't actually know this, and as a result the changes I made to the shell break lots of tests because where ever we stream in statements, we print out `Query OK` in many places that aren't expected in tests.\n\nThe equivalent dolt operations:\n```\n$ echo \"create table t (i int); drop table t;\" | dolt sql\n\n\n$ dolt sql\n# Welcome to the DoltSQL shell.\n# Statements must be terminated with ';'.\n# \"exit\" or \"quit\" (or Ctrl-D) to exit. \"\\help\" for help.\nmydb/main> create table t (i int);\nEmpty set (0.01 sec)\n\nmydb/main*>  drop table t;\nEmpty set (0.01 sec)\n\nmydb/main>\n```\n\nAs you can see, there are empty lines printed in the pipe case, and \"Empty Set\" returned in the shell case. The changes proposed by James in https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/pull/9291 and ultimately what claude tried to do don't toggle based on if the input is a pipe or interactive, and as a result will always print `Query OK` - which is not only confusing, but breaks my dolt tests which don't expect them to be there\n\nNext Steps:\n - Get `dolt sql` wise to the way it's being operated. This may require looking at the mysql shell code, or something else. One way or another we need to be aware of when printing these things makes sense.\n - Apply the SET change to GMS, and isolate it to fixing tests only in Dolt and Doltgres. Don't modify the shell output at this stage because it breaks a lot of tests and become intractable.\n -  Update the shell, in the way proposed by James, to get the right information out in the right context.\n\nIn some of these changes, we are going to want to toggle behavior with an environment flag such that we won't stop the development train with broken builds. We kind of need better options to optionally enable behaviors while also getting them in the pipeline for testing.", "Seems like our output for `INSERT` differs from mysql as well\n\nmysql\n```\nmysql> create table enum_table (i int primary key, e enum('a','b'));\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)\n\nmysql> insert into enum_table values (1, 'a'), (2, 'b');\nQuery OK, 2 rows affected (0.01 sec)\nRecords: 2  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0\n\nmysql> create table uv (u int primary key, v varchar(10));\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)\n\nmysql> insert into uv values (0, 'bug'), (1, 'ant');\nQuery OK, 2 rows affected (0.00 sec)\nRecords: 2  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0\n```\n\ndolt\n```\ntmp/main*> create table enum_table (i int primary key, e enum('a','b'));\ntmp/main*> insert into enum_table values (1, 'a'),(2,'b');\nQuery OK, 2 rows affected (0.00 sec)\ntmp/main*> create table uv (u int primary key, v varchar(10));\ntmp/main*> insert into uv values(0, 'bug'),(1,'ant');\nQuery OK, 2 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n```" ],

You should only see the last line, \"sizth line\" as the status.\r\n\r\n### What I'm trying to achieve\r\n\r\nStatus command may want to output information as soon as it's available. If shortly after that another piece of information is available, it will output another line. Normally, it works fine. Only if multiple updates happened during the bar startup, both old and new status appear together.\r\n\r\nAs an example, my program is affected. https://github.com/shibe2/sklt", "I misunderstood the issue, I thought you were having multiple status bars. Status bars will display newline characters inline. This is useful if you want something like `lsblk` to be displayed, which is normally a block of text, but in a status bar, you need that information to be in a single line. \r\n\r\nIn your case, if you are trying to only display the last line of the file, you need to change your tail command. Tail defaults to showing the last 10 lines of a file, to make it display **Only** the last line, use: `tail -n 1`. \r\n\r\nAs for getting your project to function correctly, I have created an issue https://github.com/shibe2/sklt/issues/1, as I cannot seem to make your project function.

This makes your code footprint a lot smaller, but I am unsure of the resource consumption differences. \r\n", "Thanks for your prompt reply on the `sklt` issue. Everything appears to work, though for the first minute you have the time listed twice. To circumvent this, it would be best to remove the date in your project its self, rather than trying to remove it using command-line utilities such as `tail`", "> Status bars will display newline characters inline. This is useful if you want something like lsblk to be displayed, which is normally a block of text, but in a status bar, you need that information to be in a single line.\r\n\r\nThis is not useful with *line protocol*, where each line is a new status. But even if it was useful, it is currently inconsistent: if the command outputs multiple lines immediately, they appear together; but if it does after some delay, only the last line appears.\r\n\r\n> In your case, if you are trying to only display the last line of the file, you need to change your tail command.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, my `tail` example is purely for reproduction of the issue.\r\n\r\nI also have a program that only outputs time. It uses less resources and it is more precise than a simple script. I.e. the time on screen updates almost exactly when the second changes on the computer clock.\r\n\r\nAs for your suggestion about keyboard layout, it seems to use `xkblayout` command, and I can't find it in Arch Linux repositories. Also, I tried to use X protocol for getting the current keyboard layout, but the change notification did not work under Wayland. And polling requires a compromise between CPU usage and indicator lag, so I'd like to avoid it.

Based on what I understood from the issue and the comment above, I believe I solved the issue with the following code (starting from https://github.com/swaywm/sway/blob/master/swaybar/status_line.c#L114):\n\n```\t\t\n\t\tsway_log(SWAY_DEBUG, \"Using text protocol.\");\n\t\tstatus->protocol = PROTOCOL_TEXT;\n\t\t// Gets starting address (relative to buffer) of last line on file\n\t\tsize_t i;\n\t\tsize_t lastline = i = 0;\n\t\twhile(status->buffer[i] != '\\0' && i <= status->buffer_size) {\n\t\t\tif(status->buffer[i] == '\\n' && status->buffer[i+1] != '\\0') {\n\t\t\t\tlastline = i + 1;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\ti++;\n\t\t}\n\t\tstatus->text = status->buffer + lastline; // <== ASSIGN HERE\n\t\t// intentional fall-through\n\tcase PROTOCOL_TEXT:\n\t\twhile (true) {\n\t\t\tif (status->buffer[read_bytes - 1] == '\\n') {\n\t\t\t\tstatus->buffer[read_bytes - 1] = '\\0';\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\terrno = 0;\n\t\t\tread_bytes = getline(&status->buffer,\n\t\t\t\t\t&status->buffer_size, status->read);\n\t\t\tif (errno == EAGAIN) {\n\t\t\t\tclearerr(status->read);\n\t\t\t\treturn true;\n\t\t\t} else if (errno) {\n\t\t\t\tstatus_error(status, \"[error reading from status command]\");\n\t\t\t\treturn true;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tstatus->text = status->buffer;    // <== REASSIGN HERE\n\t\t}\n\tcase PROTOCOL_I3BAR:\n\t\tstatus->text = status->buffer;  // <== REASSIGN HERE\n\t\treturn i3bar_handle_readable(status);\n\n```\n\nNotice I had to reassign status->text three times in the code, otherwise the pointer would get stuck and the output wouldn't update correctly (obviously I would remove the comments in upper case on PR). \nI believe the logic here is correct, but is the code appropriate for merging?  And if not, how would I write the code to be more secure/appropriate to the project?\nSince this would be my first time contributing, and I didn't find any specifications on how to do so, I figured it would be better to ask than to bother anyone with phony PRs. \nThank you!" ],
