      "description" : "## Background\r\n\r\nWhen debugging anything related to a device driver, the first step is often finding the `struct device` that represents the device in the kernel. One way to find a device is by its sysfs path. However, drgn doesn't currently have an easy way to do that. You can _kind of_ do it with something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> path = path_lookup(\"/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:06.0/0000:04:00.0/nvme/nvme0/nvme0n1\")\r\n>>> kn = cast(\"struct kernfs_node *\", path.dentry.d_inode.i_private)\r\n>>> kobject = cast(\"struct kobject *\", kn.priv)\r\n>>> device = container_of(kobject, \"struct device\", \"kobj\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this has a few issues:\r\n\r\n* Clearly it's not convenient at all.\r\n* `path_lookup()` walks the dentry cache, which may not be populated for a particular path depending on memory pressure.\r\n* `path_lookup()` doesn't resolve symlinks (yet, see #216), so you have to use the canonical path instead of a more convenient symlink like `/sys/block/nvme0n1`.\r\n\r\nInstead, we should improve our kernfs helpers and provide sysfs-specific helpers on top of those. This can be broken down into multiple smaller features.\r\n\r\n## kernfs\r\n\r\nsysfs is actually an instance of [kernfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernfs_(Linux)), which is generic infrastructure for pseudo file systems. A kernfs filesystem comprises a tree of [`struct kernfs_node`](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/include/linux/kernfs.h?id=1d227fcc72223cbdd34d0ce13541cbaab5e0d72f#n181), each of which represents a file or directory.\r\n\r\nWe already have a few basic helpers for inspecting kernfs: https://drgn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/helpers.html#kernfs. I would like two extensions to those:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add a `kernfs_children()` helper that returns an iterator over the children of a directory in kernfs. Children are represented by [`struct kernfs_node::dir::children`](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/include/linux/kernfs.h?id=1d227fcc72223cbdd34d0ce13541cbaab5e0d72f#n156).\r\n- [ ] Extend the `kernfs_walk()` helper to follow symlinks. These are represented by [`struct kernfs_node::symlink::target_kn`](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/include/linux/kernfs.h?id=1d227fcc72223cbdd34d0ce13541cbaab5e0d72f#n171). We should probably also have a `follow_symlinks` parameter that controls what we do if the last component of a path is a symlink, similar to the Python [`os`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#files-and-directories) module.\r\n\r\n## sysfs\r\n\r\nOnce we have the kernfs changes, we can add sysfs-specific helpers that use the new kernfs features.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add a `sysfs_lookup_node()` helper that returns the `struct kernfs_node *` at a given path.\r\n- [ ] Add a `sysfs_lookup()` helper that returns the actual object (e.g., `struct device *`, `struct bus *`, etc.) represented by a given path.\r\n- [ ] Add a `sysfs_listdir()` helper that lists the names of the children of a sysfs directory at a given path.",

It also provided ability for companies to run scripts on the EC2 machines securely using it's RunCommand feature. Adding SSM RunCommand Operator to the Amazon provider package will unlock migration to Airflow from legacy job scheduling frameworks like AutoSys\n\n### Use case/motivation\n\nI work with a few customers that are in the process of migrating jobs from AutoSys and other legacy frameworks to Airflow. For these customers, a lot of their existing jobs are in shell scripts running on EC2. When they migrate to Airflow, they are looking for an easy way to lift those scripts and run on Airflow. SSHOperator could be an option for this but in many corporate environments, SSH is disabled for security reasons. One of the secure ways AWS recommends executing a remote script on EC2 is by using SSM RunCommand.\n\n### Related issues\n\n_No response_\n\n### Are you willing to submit a PR?\n\n- [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n",

So if `pnpm test` passes after your changes, nothing is broken.\n\n#### Is your feature request related to a bug?\n\nApart of #1677\n\n### What are the alternatives?\n\nLeave it as is and not take advantage of the native rust code.\n",

If you want to actually merge two themes' options and create a new one based on them, you may want to deep merge the two options and provide them as a first argument to the `createTheme()` function.\n\nAlthough, I'm able to correctly override a theme by passing two objects:\n\n```ts\nconst theme = createTheme(\n  {\n    palette: {\n      primary: {\n        // ⬇️ red defined here\n        main: \"#ff4422\",\n      },\n    },\n  },\n  {\n    palette: {\n      primary: {\n        // ⬇️ green overriden here\n        main: \"#00ff00\",\n      },\n    },\n  }\n);\n```\n\nIs this an outdated message?

I ended up updating OpenImageIO to v2.6.2.0-dev since that is the one where the need for the boost dependency was removed.

A lot of this stuff has been pretty new to me coding wise, but I've been trying my best!", "Hi, I went back figured out how to get boost to build correctly, realized I needed to specify what msvc version I was using. Anyway after doing so I ended up only updating OpenImageIO and OpenEXR to slightly newer versions than what was listed in the original build_osl.py file because OSL was looking for Imath, but couldn't find it in ILMBase. So wanted to use a version of OpenEXR when Imath was seperated from it, and then add the same version of Imath as OpenEXR. I did so and got it to build, but again now with a different OpenImageIO version I still run into this same error:\r\n\r\nCreating library C:/madoodia/sdks/osl_release/build/OpenShadingLanguage/lib/Release/oslexec.lib and object C:/madoodia/sdks/osl_release/build/OpenShadingLanguage/lib/Release/oslexec.exp\r\nmaster.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol \"public: __cdecl OSL_v1_14_3::OSLCompiler::OSLCompiler(class OpenImageIO_v2_5::ErrorHandler *)\" (??0OSLCompiler@OSL_v1_14_3@@QEAA@PEAVErrorHandler@OpenImageIO_v2_5@@@Z) referenced in function \"public: void __cdecl OSL_v1_14_3::OSLCompiler::`default constructor closure'(void)\" (??_FOSLCompiler@OSL_v1_14_3@@QEAAXXZ) [C:\\madoodia\\sdks\\osl_release\\build\\OpenShadingLanguage\\src\\liboslexec\\oslexec.vcxproj]\r\nruntimeoptimize.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol \"public: __cdecl OSL_v1_14_3::OSLCompiler::OSLCompiler(class OpenImageIO_v2_5::ErrorHandler *)\" (??0OSLCompiler@OSL_v1_14_3@@QEAA@PEAVErrorHandler@OpenImageIO_v2_5@@@Z) [C:\\madoodia\\sdks\\osl_release\\build\\OpenShadingLanguage\\src\\liboslexec\\oslexec.vcxproj]\r\nllvm_instance.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol \"public: __cdecl OSL_v1_14_3::OSLCompiler::OSLCompiler(class OpenImageIO_v2_5::ErrorHandler *)\" (??0OSLCompiler@OSL_v1_14_3@@QEAA@PEAVErrorHandler@OpenImageIO_v2_5@@@Z) [C:\\madoodia\\sdks\\osl_release\\build\\OpenShadingLanguage\\src\\liboslexec\\oslexec.vcxproj]\r\nsymtab.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol \"public: __cdecl OSL_v1_14_3::OSLCompiler::OSLCompiler(class OpenImageIO_v2_5::ErrorHandler *)\" (??0OSLCompiler@OSL_v1_14_3@@QEAA@PEAVErrorHandler@OpenImageIO_v2_5@@@Z) [C:\\madoodia\\sdks\\osl_release\\build\\OpenShadingLanguage\\src\\liboslexec\\oslexec.vcxproj]\r\nC:\\madoodia\\sdks\\osl_release\\build\\OpenShadingLanguage\\bin\\Release\\oslexec.dll : fatal error LNK1120: 1 unresolved externals [C:\\madoodia\\sdks\\osl_release\\build\\OpenShadingLanguage\\src\\liboslexec\\oslexec.vcxproj]\r\n\r\nI tried also adding and setting the flags: \"-DLINKSTATIC=ON\", \"-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON\" to OpenImageIO but this didn't make a difference. I don't understand why this error persists. I'm also using OpenImageIO v2_5_11. So I know in the Install file for OSL it says it will work with v2_5, but wanted to check and make sure that if it's at the tail end of it, there wouldn't be issues (I wouldn't believe so, since this is the version that works with Blender currently).", "This is not an issue in your CI work, it's an actual problem in OSL where building shared libs is broken currently, oslexec does not link oslcomp, but does [something a bit naughty](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenShadingLanguage/blob/main/src/liboslexec/CMakeLists.txt#L143) and gets to the symbols it needs by including the required cpp files from oslcomp into the oslexec build. And seemingly it needs more symbols now, than it needed previously. \r\n\r\nWe ran into this today with the blender deps build (no fix as of yet), but this broke somewhere between 1.13.7.0 and the 1.14 beta \r\n\r\n", "Presumably caused by #1890.", "Potential fix in #1918, can someone check if it works?", "works\r\n ", "Okay sweet, and thanks. I will try pulling in the latest changes soon, and seeing if my CI completes it's build with that fix. How should I go about getting permission to push my commit with the updated CI? And I assume the one that uses the version of OpenImageIO that doesn't require boost, is the commit I should be pushing.", "Sorry for the wait on this. After getting the release version of the build setup and working, I moved onto the debug version but ran into some issues which came to a head at pybind11's debug build. This issue gave me a lot of trouble, and I meant to come back to it eventually for a better look later but got caught up in other work. \n\nAnyway I made mention of the issue in the commit I made on my own fork of the repo, but essentially a repeating error of \"IMPORTED_LOCATION not set for important target\" is given for a variety of targets such as: \"pybind11::module\", \"pybind11::thin_lto\", \"pybind11::windows_extras\", \"pybind11::pybind11\", etc.\n\nI believe the reason for this error may be resolved by editing the CMake code regarding pybind11, but if that is the solution then that is something I don't feel comfortable editing. Since all of my focus has been within the build_install directory, when I have had the time to work on this issue.\n\nI continued the debug build past pybind11 by removing it from the list of dependencies to build, and the other dependencies were able to build just fine including the final OSL build. There is one additional error regarding glut.h not being copied into the proper folder, but I gave a list of steps to follow regarding copying the file into it's correct folder (in the Readme). That file is needed by Partio, during it's build.\n\nBesides that I updated various versions of the dependencies, added IMath to build_osl.py, and updated the ReadMe for the build with this new information, including what dependencies needed to be installed by the user and which would automatically be installed by running the Release and Debug versions of the build_osl.bat script. Let me know if there's any other information you need, or anything regarding procedure In need to do for the commit of this issue.\n\nThanks,\nNate" ],

You can also see the Langchain implementation here:\n- https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/evaluation/langchain.evaluation.agents.trajectory_eval_chain.TrajectoryEvalChain.html\n- https://github.com/langchain-ai/agentevals/tree/main/python/agentevals/trajectory\n\nExample of an existing judge metric (Hallucination) is defined here:\n- Docs: https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/evaluation/metrics/hallucination\n- Docs Code: https://github.com/comet-ml/opik/blob/main/apps/opik-documentation/documentation/fern/docs/evaluation/metrics/hallucination.mdx\n- Python SDK: https://github.com/comet-ml/opik/tree/main/sdks/python/src/opik/evaluation/metrics/llm_judges/hallucination\n- Python Examples: https://github.com/comet-ml/opik/blob/main/sdks/python/examples/metrics.py\n- Frontend: https://github.com/comet-ml/opik/blob/main/apps/opik-frontend/src/constants/llm.ts\n\nIdeally this is implemented as an LLM-as-a-judge. Expectation is the new judge is added to the frontend for using LLM-as-a-judge from the UI (Online Evaluation tab) as well as in the Python SDK. The appropriate docs needs to be updated and a video attached of the metric working.\n\nReturn should be float (0-1), and if its using LLM as a eval then should also contain a \"reason/explanation\"\n\n### Motivation\n\nI would like to see more robust set of metrics and evaluations based on recent research.",

It clearly states that EOS and image deprecation date for tis image is May 2025. \n\nI suspect the error can be easily fixed by updating [this line](https://github.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-apps/blob/55d09c01704909e1142fd14e2a91d5525872efd0/server_manager/www/gcp_account.ts#L275), but I'm not sure what image is to be used (otherwise I could try to open a PR). \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. open Outline Manager\n2. connect to GCP account\n3. create a project using \"ADD SERVER\" tab\n4. create server using on of the locations (same behaviour is observed for multiple server locations)\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\nSuccessfully completed addition of new server as it was before.\n\n### What actually happened?\n\nI've tried to create a new GCP server using the respective option in \"ADD SERVER\" tab. \n\n### Outline Version\n\n1.17.2\n\n### What operation system are you using?\n\nmacOS\n\n### Operating System Version\n\nSonoma 14.6.1\n\n### Screenshots and Videos\n\n_No response_",

Write a brief description of how you will approach the task (without using ChatGPT).\n3. Add your Telegram handler in your application (e.g., in OnlyDust or similar)\n4. Write ETA in your application\n\n\n\n## What should I do if I have a problem\n1. Try to google it before asking. Googling is taking major part of dev work \n2. If you couldn't find answer your question with Google, text your question to [dev](https://t.me/spotnet_dev/4) group with your question.\n3. Do not send DM to maintainer, it would be better and faster to ask other contributors in chat \n\n\n## How to prepare PR\n1. Check if your code [smell](https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/smells) good\n2. Add `close #<issue number>` to link your issue with your PR\n3. Do not commit changes that are unrelated to your task\n4. Check after you created PR, if you committed everything\n\n\n## Task Description\n1. Add a new service to [`docker-compose.margin.yml`](./blob/main/devops/docker-compose.margin.yml) named `notification_bot`. Configure it to build using the `Dockerfile` located in the [`telegram`](./blob/main/margin/margin_app/app/telegram) directory.\n2. After building the Compose stack, share a screenshot showing that it completed successfully.",

This is great.\n\nI've noticed in my own experimentation, plus reviewing these PRs, that my biggest concern is that we just don't have enough tests. A lot of code is untouched by the test suite. Codecov is not the perfect tool here, because it has a little trouble parsing fypp -> f90, so it marks some lines as not covered that are actually covered. Still, there are things like the output files, the probes, data transfer between simulation -> post_process, and so on. \n\nThe code is not so hard to refactor, but there are some areas that are concerning. I suspect that #914 is a side effect of me or someone else's PR (I could be wrong). This case simply wasn't tested in CI appropriately.\n\nThere is a tango required to get decent tests without overfitting to specific computers or spending 10 hours in CI running (plus another 10 hours queuing in some cases). But I would rather have good tests so we can more confidently refactor and add features than be cavalier about merging quite important changes into the code. \n\nAn example is #907 from @XZTian64 or #855 (and similar) from @Malmahrouqi3 and #901 from me. I'm not fully confident that nothing will go wrong in merging these, despite the tests. The ones that involve writing probes or post_process are most concerning at the moment, I think." ],

Is there any prometheus alerts rules avaliable for jaeger version 2.x.x\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Environment: Use Jaeger 2.3.0 with OpenTelemetry \n2.  using curl http://127.0.0.1:8888/metrics\n3.  on prometheus server, we have added in location /etc/prometheus/rules/jaeger.rules.yml  but it is not working .\n4.  root@virtplatform:~# cat /etc/prometheus/rules/jaeger.rules.yml\n```\ngroups:\n- name: jaeger_alerts\n  rules:\n    - alert: PromHttpMetricErrs\n      annotations:\n        message: |\n           {{ $labels.job }} {{ $labels.instance }} is experiencing {{ printf \"%.2f\" $value }}% HTTP errors.\n      expr: 100 * sum(rate(promhttp_metric_handler_errors_total[1m])) by (instance, job ) / sum(rate(http_server_duration_milliseconds_sum[1m])) by (instance, job)> 1\n      for: 15m\n      labels:\n        severity: warning\n\n    - alert: OtelReceiverRefusedSpans\n      annotations:\n        message: |\n          service {{ $labels.job }} {{ $labels.instance }} is dropping {{ printf \"%.2f\" $value }}% spans.\n      expr: 100 * sum(rate(otelcol_receiver_refused_spans_total[1m])) by (instance, job) / sum(rate(jaeger_reporter_spans[1m])) by (instance, job)> 1\n      for: 15m\n      labels:\n        severity: warning\n```\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nIt is should be expected like below sample.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac5dbf91-5e05-48d8-b24d-5a61d90c2713)\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```shell\n\n```\n\n### Screenshot\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Jaeger backend version\n\nv2.3.0\n\n### SDK\n\n_No response_\n\n### Pipeline\n\n_No response_\n\n### Stogage backend\n\n_No response_\n\n### Operating system\n\n_No response_\n\n### Deployment model\n\n_No response_\n\n### Deployment configs\n\n```shell\n\n```",

This causes:\n\n- Confusing validation errors\n- Two conflicting rollout sources\n- A broken mental model\n\n---\n\n### Proposed Fix (shown in the prototype)\n\n1. User adds a scheduled rollout via the **Schedule** tab.\n2. Only after selecting a date and time, the release condition fields appear (progressive disclosure).\n3. The **Overview** tab updates to clearly show the scheduled rollout date and percentage.\n\nThis makes the state clear, avoids user errors, and reinforces the schedule as the single source of truth.\n\nLet me know your thoughts! Happy to refine it!", "I like it! However, we don't allow editing a schedule. So after you click \"Schedule\", we should probably reset the state of the form so a person can schedule their next change should they so choose. Keeping the rollout field around is confusing." ],

The version is never disabled and the secret is not removed at the end of the packer run though and this has implication if the key vault is being backed up (500 version limit on backups and performance impacts).\n\nIt would be nice to have an option to delete the secret at the end to avoid the potential for hitting the limit and to avoid the performance impact that their documentation notes.\n\n#### Use Case(s)\n\nAllow for meeting company policy dictating key vault security and backup requirements without impact.\n\n#### Potential configuration\n\n```\nbuild_key_vault_secret_delete = true \n```\n\n#### Potential References\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/service-limits#backup-keys-secrets-certificates\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/service-limits#limits-on-count-of-keys-secrets-and-certificates\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/keyvault/secrets/delete-secret/delete-secret?view=rest-keyvault-secrets-7.4&tabs=HTTP\n",

The previous file with the old name should be deleted.\r\n\r\n**Tasks:**\r\n\r\n1. **Add the \"Rename\" button:**\r\n   - Place the \"Rename\" button between the ComboBox (preset selector) and the \"Delete\" button.\r\n   - Ensure the button is clearly labeled and fits within the existing layout.\r\n\r\n2. **Implement the popup modal:**\r\n   - Create a modal that appears when the \"Rename\" button is clicked.\r\n   - The modal should include:\r\n     - An input field for the new preset name.\r\n     - \"Confirm\" and \"Cancel\" buttons.\r\n   - The \"Confirm\" button should only be enabled if the input field is not empty.\r\n\r\n3. **Handle renaming logic:**\r\n   - Update the `presets.name` property with the new name when the user clicks \"Confirm\".\r\n   - Rename the corresponding preset file to match the new name and delete the old file.\r\n   - Ensure the file renaming is done safely, checking for any name conflicts or invalid characters.\r\n\r\n4. **Update the ComboBox selection and display:**\r\n   - Refresh the ComboBox options to reflect the updated preset name.\r\n   - Maintain the current selection in the ComboBox with the new name after renaming.\r\n\r\n5. **Test the renaming functionality:**\r\n   - Verify that the \"Rename\" button opens the modal correctly.\r\n   - Test renaming with various inputs (valid, invalid, empty, conflicting names).\r\n   - Confirm that the file is renamed correctly and the old file is deleted.\r\n   - Ensure the ComboBox updates to reflect the new name without issues.\r\n\r\n6. **Update documentation:**\r\n   - Document the new \"Rename\" functionality.\r\n   - Update any relevant sections of the user guide to explain how to rename presets.\r\n\r\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\r\n- The \"Rename\" button appears between the ComboBox and \"Delete\" button and functions as intended.\r\n- The popup modal asks the user for a new name, and the \"Confirm\" button only works when a valid name is provided.\r\n- The preset's name is updated both in the object (`presets.name`) and the corresponding file.\r\n- The previous file is deleted after renaming.\r\n- The ComboBox correctly displays the updated preset name.\r\n- Documentation is updated to reflect the new feature.\r\n\r\n**Additional Context:**\r\n- The project uses ImGui, and the modal should integrate seamlessly with the existing UI.\r\n- Ensure that renaming presets does not interfere with other functionalities like saving, loading, or deleting presets.",

      "description" : "### \uD83D\uDE80 The feature, motivation and pitch\n\nI want to add a unit test for AOTI testing if user_managed weights works with load_state_dict.\n\nIt can follow a similar test https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/test/inductor/test_aot_inductor.py#L5733-L5835, but the new test is supposed to be simpler. \n\nUser managed is the last bool passed into update_constant_buffer:\nhttps://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/d5d14ee823e70224a154884a5c2912643d648094/torch/_C/_aoti.pyi#L28\n\n# Motivation:\n\nAOTI will take in an eager (i.e. un-compiled)model and spit out a AOTI Model that is compiled. update_constant_buffer is an api to update the weights of such model. If we set user_managed=True, the new weights that we are passing in should just point to the tensors (i.e. no copy is done). So ideally, if we update the tensors we passed it, the changes should reflect on the AOTI model. This is already tested in test_update_user_managed_buffer.\n\nWhat I want to see tested is if we:\n1. pass in the model weights to AOTI model with user managed\n2. Update the eager model weights with load_state_dict\n3. Check if the update is reflected on the AOTI model.\n\n### Alternatives\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\ncc @chauhang @penguinwu @avikchaudhuri @gmagogsfm @zhxchen17 @tugsbayasgalan @angelayi @suo @ydwu4 @desertfire @chenyang78 @yushangdi @benjaminglass1",

Is it still relevant or not?", "From what I can tell, we could introduce a new configuration option to truncate large data fields within the ValueObject property. A good place to implement this might be here:\n\uD83D\uDC49 https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/blob/master/pkg/apis/application/v1alpha1/values.go#L34.\n\nIf the serialized data at this point (https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/blob/master/pkg/apis/application/v1alpha1/values.go#L20) is too large, we could truncate it accordingly.\n\nAdditionally, I'm considering introducing levels of truncation for deeply nested JSON structures. For this, we could add a --log-json-max-depth configuration flag. For example, if --log-json-max-depth=2, everything deeper than 2 levels would be replaced with a placeholder like \"...(truncated)\".\n\nGiven the following example:\n```\n{\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"name\": \"app\",\n    \"labels\": {\n      \"env\": \"prod\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"spec\": {\n    \"containers\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"nginx\",\n        \"resources\": {\n          \"limits\": {\n            \"cpu\": \"500m\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\nWith --log-json-max-depth=2, it would become:\n```\n{\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"name\": \"app\",\n    \"labels\": \"...(truncated)\"\n  },\n  \"spec\": {\n    \"containers\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"nginx\",\n        \"resources\": \"...(truncated)\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\nThis would allow users to control how much detail they want to include in logs, preventing overly verbose output while retaining useful context.

Review the current copy on our color pages to ensure it reflects the reality of our new color system\n2. Ensure we are providing helpful guidance around how and when to apply colors.\n\n## Additional Context:\n\nThese are the two pages that we should focus on:\nhttps://eui.elastic.co/#/theming/colors/values\nhttps://eui.elastic.co/#/utilities/color-palettes\n\nSpecifically, these are some thoughts that jump out to me:\n\nI'm unsure whether or not the text is accurate / helpful.\n<img width=\"761\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d6ea2a3-7a9d-4546-afb4-2f92291cea1f\" />\n\nThe math doesn't add up on this one -- this is describing a palette of 6 colors. And do we still call them \"Brand colors\"?\n\n<img width=\"802\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f2191a8-26cd-4fd3-a3aa-61d47549d5c4\" />\n\nMany colors included could use a description. How and when should colors be applied. I suspect we could use this for all color tokens we have included.\n<img width=\"580\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d0893f28-5df2-4254-b340-16d5b583c2a0\" />\n\nWe include deprecated colors in our documentation.

So my hunch is that it wasn't documented? I wonder how much of that exists.\n\nHonestly, I still don't quite understand the relation between our color palettes and color tokens, when to use which, and what tokens map to which palettes.", "TL;DR - I agree, we need to have a stronger, clearer stance on this topic.\n\nRoughly speaking, what we see today is essentially the results of progressing from not having proper tokens to having them.\n- In the 'olden days', `euiPalette*` was a convenient way to obtain (or create on the fly!) an array of colors.\n- Now, we have tokens - colors specified with intent - and a naming convention that gets to the same result... a set(s) of colors _for data viz_\n\nWhere things got muddied is that these palettes were used sorta like faux tokens. Out of convenience, people began plucking out values and using them in non-dataviz use cases.\n\nThis topic will inevitably lead toward _\"Do we still need the palettes then?\"_\n- I would hash that out with the data viz experts.\n- Note that these palettes are also exposed to users when building visualizations so, in that regard, we may need to keep the component but be more restrictive on its use and guidelines." ],

Considering how often people ask about examples, I think it might make more sense to put one combined page on the main site, and potentially link to it from both docs. It would also then make sense, I imagine, to add a column for \"BeeWare component(s) used\". \n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nWe could still maintain separate pages, but I'm not sure if there's a good way to make sure they stay in sync with each other. It's also not clear, currently, from just looking at one, which of the apps also use the other.\n\nIf we do keep the individual pages, it seems redundant to mention that each app uses the tech in question.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

I disabled Windows search indexing on my Nextcloud directory because windows kept on downloading files I wanted to only keep online every time I searched for something in the parent folder.\n\nThe search function in the Nextcloud tray menu is able to find the desired sub folder, but clicking the folder only opens the containing folder and not the folder itself. This is useless to me because, as said, there are a lot of different folders and the folder names are too similar.\n\nIt looks like Nextcloud just opens the containing folder for folders or files. It would be nice if there was at least a context open to allow opening folder or files.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nOpen folder or file by default and have open containing folder the context menu option, but that risks messing with other people's workflow since open containing folder is the current behavior.",

No error message is shown to direct me to how to fix the issue.\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n1. Take an offer\n2. Send the collateral\n3. Attempt to submit an invoice with a small PPM to force failure\n4. Notice no message comes up\n5. Check the dev console and look at the failed call in the Network tab.\n6. Cry a little\n\n**Expected behavior**\nI expected that a failure would show a toast or something to tell me how to fix the problem. The message returned from the API has the information I would need. It just should be surfaced in the UI so I don't have to go looking through the Network tab to find the solution.\n\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\n - OS: PopOS\n - Browser: Tor Browser\n - Version: 14.5.4\n",

However, if I set up a rule to append to a note, no space is added between the note and added text. I'm ok with either behavior, but would prefer it to be consistent.\n\n### How can we reproduce the issue?\n\nSelect a transaction, bulk edit note, prepend or append, type anything in. You will notice a space is placed in between the old and new text.\n\nCreate a rule (or just use the rule editor to bulk edit) that prepends or appends to a note, run it, you'll see that no space is added.\n\n### Where are you hosting Actual?\n\nDocker\n\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\n\nChrome, Firefox\n\n### Operating System\n\nWindows 11",

      "comments" : [ "DataFlex uses a lot of different file extensions, some of which will likely have conflicts. Modern DataFlex uses a common workspace structure, such as `AppSrc/cMyClass.pkg`. Searching for [NOT is:fork path:Appsrc/**.pkg](https://github.com/search?type=code&q=NOT+is%3Afork+path%3AAppsrc%2F**.pkg\n) narrows it down to effectively DataFlex source code files and provides 900+ results. Many of the other file extensions are nowhere near that many, so it won't meet the minimum usage requirements.\n\nGiven that there are so many file extensions in use, maybe a better initial approach could be to add support for DataFlex without specifying `extensions` or `filenames` to avoid conflicts. And DataFlex source repositories can use `.gitattributes` overrides for the relevant extensions instead. Obviously not ideal, but it would at least provide recognition for the DataFlex language, and that's a great starting point.\n\nI see there is some precedence for languages without specifying file extensions, such as for Elvish transcripts from PR #6302, which is mainly used inside markdown files. @lildude and @NilsSve, I can help and put up a PR for adding the DataFlex language without specifying any file extensions, would that work?\n", "Hi Sonny,\n\nIf you are asking me, yes, that would help!

The Elvish exception is because there isn't a common extension as it's predominantly used in a markdown files. This is not the case with DataFlex.\n\nI see. That makes sense. DataFlex is an old language that's been around in its current object-oriented form for 20+ years. Its use is mainly for database business applications, for Windows and web apps. It unfortunately doesn't have a single dedicated file extension, and the convention is to use one of a set of extensions representing the main purpose of the specific DataFlex source file. Such as `.vw` for a view, and other extensions for database business logic etc. The `.pkg` extension is typically used for reusable classes, which is why it's the predominant extension seen on GitHub.\n\n> If the language predominantly uses a generic extension like .pkg (poor design decision IMO), this can be added the generic.yml file and a heuristic will be used to identify the language, but be warned: this heuristic must be very accurate to only identify DataFlex files and must be linear and performant. It's better for this regex to under identify DataFlex files than misidentify other languages.\n\nThat sounds like a great idea, thanks! I will pursue this strategy for the `.pkg` file extension since it's the most commonly used extension. I'll follow the instructions and add it to `generic.yml` with heuristics and tests. Thanks again!", "And may I add that DataFlex has two frameworks. One for Windows and one for the Web, with overlaps between them for datadictionaries for consistent database behaviour.\n\nHowever, the frameworks are not optionals/add-ons like in many other languages. Instead they are an integrated part of the DataFlex language. And they are written in the DataFlex language.\n\nSure, a web-based DataFlex application also uses javascript libraries and many other parts needed for a modern webapp, but those files are not part of the frameworks. The build in frameworks are more guided towards how to develop applications more easy, fluently and make the code more robust and easier to follow." ],

These enhancements aim to improve how citizens interact with the issue reporting and tracking flow.\n\n---\n\n## 1. \uD83D\uDCCB Copy Issue Link Button\n\n### Problem\nThere’s currently no easy way to share a direct link to a specific issue.\n\n### Solution\n- Add a **copy-to-clipboard** button (copy icon) near each issue title.\n- Clicking it should copy the full permalink of the issue (e.g., `https://civix.app/issues/42`) to the user’s clipboard.\n- Display a **toast notification** confirming the action.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```jsx\n<IssueHeader>\n  <h2>{issue.title}</h2>\n  <CopyLinkButton issueId={issue.id} />\n</IssueHeader>\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2. \uD83C\uDF89 Submission Confirmation\n\n### Problem\nAfter reporting an issue, users aren’t clearly informed about success or what to do next.\n\n### Solution\n- Show a **modal popup** confirming successful submission.\n- Include the **new issue ID** (e.g., Issue #42).\n- Offer two clear next steps:\n  - ✅ View the reported issue\n  - ➕ Report another issue\n\n### Mock Layout\n\n```\n+-----------------------------+\n|  \uD83C\uDF89 Thank You!             |\n|  ✓ Issue #42 reported!     |\n|                             |\n|  [ View Issue ] [ Report Another ] |\n+-----------------------------+\n```\n\n---\n\n## 3. \uD83D\uDD22 Smart Character Counters\n\n### Problem\nUsers can’t see how many characters they’ve typed or how close they are to a limit.\n\n### Solution\n- Add **live character counters** to all long-text input fields (e.g., description).\n- Use color indicators:\n  - \uD83D\uDFE2 Normal (< 80%): gray text (`text-gray-500`)\n  - \uD83D\uDFE0 Near Limit (≥ 80%): orange text (`text-orange-500`)\n  - \uD83D\uDD34 Over Limit: red text (`text-red-600`)\n- Set configurable limits (e.g., 500 characters).\n\n### Example UI States\n\n| State       | Color         | Example        |\n|-------------|---------------|----------------|\n| Normal      | Gray          | `45 / 500`     |\n| Near Limit  | Orange        | `410 / 500`    |\n| Over Limit  | Red           | `502 / 500`    |\n\n---\n\n## \uD83E\uDDEA Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] All features work correctly in **both Light and Dark modes**\n- [ ] Fully **mobile-responsive**\n- [ ] No regressions or broken functionality\n- [ ] (Optional) Components added to **Storybook** if applicable\n- [ ] Code includes clear, maintainable structure with reusable components\n\n---\n\n## \uD83E\uDDF0 Tech Notes\n\n- Copy button may use [`navigator.clipboard.writeText()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clipboard/writeText)\n- Toasts can use an existing toast component or [React Hot Toast](https://react-hot-toast.com/)\n- Character counter can be a custom hook or inline logic for now\n\n---\n\n## \uD83D\uDCCC Related Areas\n\n- `IssueDetail.jsx`\n- `NewIssueForm.jsx`\n- `components/ui/Toast.jsx`\n- `components/ui/Modal.jsx`\n- `components/CharacterCounter.jsx` (to be created)\n\n---\n\n**Let’s ship these delightfully helpful improvements \uD83D\uDE80**\n",

Usually this occurs when an app is buggy and only sends the leaf certificate without its chain, and explicitly trusting the leaf's issuing intermediate CA seems to fix the problem for them. Crucially, when that intermediate is then rotated their app will break.\r\n\r\nWe could add a toggle, defaulting to false, such as `allowIntermediateCertificates`. If false, it would parse every certificate and ensure that it's self-signed. There might be other ways of achieving the same goal.\r\n\r\nHaving this in from the start could prevent so many misconfigurations by unsuspecting cluster admins.\r\n\r\n(Complication: If we added a list of publicly trusted certs it'd probably need to default to allowing intermediates in that list by default - but we could definitely default to disallowing intermediates everywhere else)",

We have labeled each network set with something like `networking.our.internal.stuff/networkset: <name>` to be able to select a single network set in our network policies. We are concerned that someone accidentally adds the same label to a pod or another resource and thus undermines our network policies.\n\n## Expected Behavior\n<!--- If you're describing a bug, tell us what should happen -->\n<!--- If you're suggesting a change/improvement, tell us how it should work -->\n\nIt would be cool if something similar to `projectcalico.org/orchestrator` exists that lets us specify the resource type we want to select. \n\n## Current Behavior\n<!--- If describing a bug, tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->\n<!--- If suggesting a change/improvement, explain the difference from current behavior -->\n\nWe can use `global()` to select across all global resources, but cannot limit this to just GlobalNetworkSets. We can use an external policy agent, like OPA or kyverno, to disallow setting our networkset labels on resources that are not network sets but this requires an additional system to be deployed.\n\n## Possible Solution\n<!--- Not obligatory, but suggest a fix/reason for the bug, -->\n<!--- or ideas how to implement the addition or change -->\n\nCalico could automatically add a new label, e.g. `projectcalico.org/kind` to each calico resource so that we can select resources by kind and their labels within the same selector. In our case, we could write a selector like `networking.our.internal.stuff/networkset == \"some-name\" && projectcalico.org/kind == \"GlobalNetworkSet\"`\n\nAnother solution would be something like a `kind(GlobalNetworkSet)` expression that does the same, but does not require an extra label.\n\n## Context\n<!--- How has this issue affected you? What are you trying to accomplish? -->\n<!--- Providing context helps us come up with a solution that is most useful in the real world -->\n\nWe want to be as strict as possible in our network policies and close any potential loophole that might exist in our setup.\n",

Their labels are not. It is possible to add the same label to two different network sets potentially allowing much more than expected. Something like `kind(GlobalNetworkSet) && name(Something)` as an expression would perfectly express what we want without allowing any potential misconfiguration.\n\nAgain, we can work around this using additional tooling (VAP/OPA/Kyverno) that verifies that the value of our `networking.our.internal.stuff/networkset` label exactly matches the name of a global network set, but built-in support for more precision when declaring network policies would be really nice!", "Hey guys,\n\nI'd love to try and work on this one. Do you have a general advice where I should start with this?", "Thanks @ivnhk ! \n\nI'd start by familiarizing yourself with how to build and run Calico and its tests. There's a general contribution guide here: https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md (although I'll admit, it might be a tad out of date...)\n\nYou might also want to poke around to see how the (very similar) `orchestrator` label is handled for kubernetes pods. Here's a hint: https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/blob/f3da524b7c6e4cfdf9874b2cddd0233213a1d8f3/libcalico-go/lib/backend/k8s/conversion/workload_endpoint_default.go#L163\n\nWe convert pods into an internal type called \"WorkloadEndpoint\" and when we do, we force a label to be set on it for selection. \n\nFor NetworkSets, you could probably do something similar - or even better since it's an API that we control, you could also add it to the defaulting and validation code for that API - here are some hints on that part:\n\n- https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/blob/master/libcalico-go/lib/clientv3/networkset.go\n- https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/blob/f3da524b7c6e4cfdf9874b2cddd0233213a1d8f3/libcalico-go/lib/validator/v3/validator.go#L269-L270 " ],

      "description" : "## Bug Report\n\nPlease answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\n\n### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)\n\n1.  Open https://www.kcl-lang.io/ on a mobile device (or resize your browser window to a mobile viewport width).\n2.  Scroll down to the \"Subscribe to Newsletter\" section.\n\n### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)\n\nThe email input field and the \"SUBSCRIBE\" button should ideally be horizontally aligned, or at least optimized for a tidier and more integrated appearance on mobile screens.\n\n### 3. What did you see instead (Required)\n\nThe email input field and the \"SUBSCRIBE\" button are currently displayed vertically (one above the other), resulting in an untidy and less integrated appearance on mobile devices.\n\n**Screenshots:**\n**Current Mobile Layout:**\n<img width=\"120\" alt=\"Mobile - before\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0a8aba4-28e1-4d38-81b5-b3877e3c110a\" />\n*Description:* Shows the input field and button stacked vertically.\n\n### 4. What is your KCL components version? (Required)\n\nN/A. This issue pertains to the User Interface (UI) of the `kcl-lang.io` website on mobile, not to a KCL component or runtime.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Information\n\nI have a local fix that adjusts the CSS/layout of the subscribe form to align the email input field and the \"SUBSCRIBE\" button horizontally on mobile viewports. This change significantly improves the form's appearance and responsiveness.\n\n**Screenshot of Proposed Layout (Local Fix Example):**\n<img width=\"120\" alt=\"Mobile - after\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab312215-2880-4d00-9fb8-16e539437abd\" />\n*Description:* Shows the input field and button horizontally aligned, demonstrating a cleaner look.\n\nI am ready to open a Pull Request (PR) with the proposed changes if this improvement is a good fit for the project. Please let me know if you would like me to proceed with a PR.\n\nThank you for your consideration.",

Write a brief description of how you will approach the task (without using ChatGPT).\n3. Add your Telegram handler in your application (e.g., in OnlyDust or similar)\n4. Write ETA in your application\n\n\n\n## What should I do if I have a problem\n1. Try to google it before asking. Googling is taking major part of dev work \n2. If you couldn't find answer your question with Google, text your question to [dev](https://t.me/spotnet_dev/4) group with your question.\n3. Do not send DM to maintainer, it would be better and faster to ask other contributors in chat \n\n\n## How to prepare PR\n1. Check if your code [smell](https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/smells) good\n2. Add `close #<issue number>` to link your issue with your PR\n3. Do not commit changes that are unrelated to your task\n4. Check after you created PR, if you committed everything\n\n\n## Task Description\n1. Review the [reset_password logic](https://github.com/djeck1432/spotnet/blob/406ba4042303f7e79f036c2fccefa7bc377e37d6/margin/margin_app/app/api/admin.py#L184-L215). Update it to accept only `new_password`—remove any unnecessary schema fields. Make sure to **verify the token** received, use it to retrieve the email, then fetch the corresponding admin by email, update their password, and apply password hashing.\n2. Review the tests related to `reset_password`. If they exist, update them as needed; if not, create new tests to cover this functionality.\n3. Confirm that the workflow and the endpoint function correctly.\n",

      "description" : "## Guideline\n1. Carefully read the issue description before applying to ensure you have all the necessary information to start working on it.\n2. Write a brief description of how you will approach the task (without using ChatGPT).\n3. Add your Telegram handler in your application (e.g., in OnlyDust or similar)\n4. Write ETA in your application\n\n\n\n## What should I do if I have a problem\n1. Try to google it before asking. Googling is taking major part of dev work \n2. If you couldn't find answer your question with Google, text your question to [dev](https://t.me/spotnet_dev/4) group with your question.\n3. Do not send DM to maintainer, it would be better and faster to ask other contributors in chat \n\n\n## How to prepare PR\n1. Check if your code [smell](https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/smells) good\n2. Add `close #<issue number>` to link your issue with your PR\n3. Do not commit changes that are unrelated to your task\n4. Check after you created PR, if you committed everything\n\n\n## Task Description\n1. In the [filters folder](./blob/main/margin/margin_app/app/telegram/filters), create a new admin filter that checks the user ID against `ADMIN_IDS` from the settings. If it matches, return `True`.\n2. Create a new handler in [this folder](./blob/main/margin/margin_app/app/telegram/handlers), for example `/admin_check`, that replies with a message like `You are an admin!` or `You aren’t an admin!`, or a similar message conveying the same meaning.\n",

As of now, Souvlaki leaves it up to the user to change the URL depending on the platform.\r\n\r\nFor Linux, we follow the MPRIS specification, which actually doesn't say much cover art apart from what's in [here](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/mpris-spec/metadata/#mpris:arturl). It only says that local files should start with `file://` and that it should be an UTF-8 string, which is enforced by Rust. Maybe you can look in the source code of desktop managers such as GNOME or KDE, since these read the field to display it on their media player controls.\r\n\r\nFor Windows, we use the _SystemMediaTransportControlsDisplayUpdater_, which has [a thumbnail property](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.media.systemmediatransportcontrolsdisplayupdater.thumbnail?view=winrt-22621#windows-media-systemmediatransportcontrolsdisplayupdater-thumbnail). It accepts multiple formats, but we choose to create it using an URI. If setting an URL starting with `file://`, the file is automatically loaded by souvlaki.\r\n\r\nFor MacOS, you can look into [these lines](https://github.com/Sinono3/souvlaki/blob/384539fe83e8bf5c966192ba28e9405e3253619b/src/platform/macos/mod.rs#L131-L137) of the implementation. These lines refer to creating an [MPMediaItemArtwork](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mediaplayer/mpmediaitemartwork) object.\r\n\r\nI hope this is of use to you.

Therefore, we should thrive for full test coverage\n\nHaving a look at the [coverage report](https://app.codecov.io/gh/ros-controls/control_toolbox/tree/ros2-master/control_toolbox), we see that some methods have no coverage, e.g., \n\n- `void PidROS::reset()`\n- `void PidROS::reset(bool save_i_term)`\n- `double PidROS::compute_command(double error, double error_dot, const rclcpp::Duration & dt)`\n- `void PidROS::set_current_cmd(double cmd) { pid_.set_current_cmd(cmd); }`\n- `double PidROS::get_current_cmd() { return pid_.get_current_cmd(); }`\n- `void PidROS::print_values()`\n\nand in general, we have little coverage in testing the input validations.\n\nImprove that by additional tests/test-cases.\n\n## Instructions\nHi, this is a `good-first-issue` issue. This means we've worked to make it more legible to people who either **haven't contributed to our codebase before, or even folks who haven't contributed to open source before**.\n\nWe're interested in helping you take the first step, and can answer questions and help you out along the way. Note that we're especially interested in contributions from underrepresented groups!\n\nWe know that creating a pull request is the biggest barrier for new contributors. This issue is for you \uD83D\uDC9D\n\nIf you have contributed before, **consider leaving this PR for someone new**, and looking through our general [bug](https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_control/labels/bug) issues. Thanks!\n\n### \uD83E\uDD14 What you will need to know.\n\nNothing. This issue is meant to welcome you to Open Source :) We are happy to walk you through the process.\n\n### \uD83D\uDCCB Step by Step\n\n- [ ] \uD83D\uDE4B **Claim this issue**: Comment below. If someone else has claimed it, ask if they've opened a pull request already and if they're stuck -- maybe you can help them solve a problem or move it along!\n\n- [ ] \uD83D\uDDC4️ **Create a local workspace** for making your changes and testing [following these instructions](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Tutorials/Workspace/Creating-A-Workspace.html), for Step 3 use \"Download Source Code\" section with [these instructions](https://control.ros.org/master/doc/getting_started/getting_started.html#building-from-source).\n\n- [ ] \uD83C\uDF74 **Fork the repository** using the handy button at the top of the repository page and **clone** it into `~/ws_ros2_control/src/ros-controls/ros2_control`, [here is a guide that you can follow](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) (You will have to remove or empty the existing `ros2_control` folder before cloning your own fork)\n\n- [ ] **Checkout a new branch** using `git checkout -b <branch_name>`\n\n- [ ] \uD83E\uDD16 **Apply `pre-commit`** auto formatting, by running `pip3 install pre-commit` and running `pre-commit install` in the ros2_control repo.\n\n- [ ] \uD83D\uDCBE **Commit and Push** your changes\n\n- [ ] \uD83D\uDD00 **Start a Pull Request** to request to merge your code into `master`. There are two ways that you can start a pull request:\n1. If you are not familiar with GitHub or how to create a pull request, [here is a guide you can follow](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) on how GitHub works.\n\n- [ ] \uD83C\uDFC1 **Done** Ask in comments for a review :)\n\n### Is someone else already working on this?\n\n\uD83D\uDD17- We encourage contributors to link to the original issue in their pull request so all users can easily see if someone's already started on it.\n\n\uD83D\uDC65- **If someone seems stuck, offer them some help!**\n\n### \uD83E\uDD14❓ Questions?\n\nDon’t hesitate to ask questions or to get help if you feel like you are getting stuck.

When SOFT_AFFINITY is selected, scheduler will make the best effort to request the same worker to fetch the same file._\n\n`hive.node-selection-strategy` is mentioned in [Iceberg Connector](https://prestodb.io/docs/current/connector/iceberg.html), but is not mentioned in [Hive Connector.](https://prestodb.io/docs/current/connector/hive.html) ",

For example, link to version 1.7 could initially point to the main downloads page and later redirect to the archive page. Or, whether we need to create stable links for each version\n\uD83E\uDDE9 Code Changes\n\t• Confirm that the correct major and minor version numbers are accessible—or can be made accessible—in code at the point where the error dialog is invoked (see [Initialize_OnError_ShowUI](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK/blob/5ce1f09f8ed314dd647c12be1d910ef894645168/dev/Deployment/DeploymentManager.cpp#L661) and [MddBootstrapInitialize_ShowUI_OnNoMatch](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK/blob/5ce1f09f8ed314dd647c12be1d910ef894645168/dev/WindowsAppRuntime_BootstrapDLL/MddBootstrap.cpp#L1153))\n\t• Construct a version-specific URL using the major and minor version numbers and pass it to the ShellExecute call.\n\uD83D\uDD2E Future-Proofing\n\t• Consider fallback behavior if a version-specific link is unavailable (low priority)." ],

We think that KubeStellar works in more configurations, and they should be tested.\r\n\r\n- Things other than `kind` providing Kubernetes clusters.\r\n- The WDS and/or ITS role played by the hosting cluster.\r\n- The WDS and/or ITS role played by some other pre-existing cluster.\r\n- One new ControlPlane playing both ITS and WDS roles.\r\n\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nDo something. Without expanding the gating CI tests too much (note: I am not asserting exactly how much is too much).\n\n### Want to contribute?\n\n- [ ] I would like to work on this issue.\n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_",

name\n\nlint/correctness/noUnusedImports\n\n### Playground link\n\nhttps://biomejs.dev/playground/?code=aQBtAHAAbwByAHQAIAB0AHkAcABlACAAewB9ACAAZgByAG8AbQAgACcAQABtAHUAaQAvAHgALQBkAGEAdABhAC0AZwByAGkAZAAvAHQAaABlAG0AZQBBAHUAZwBtAGUAbgB0AGEAdABpAG8AbgAnADsA\n\n### Expected result\n\nFor certain libraries like MUI, we have imports purely for type augmentation like this:\n\n```ts\nimport type {} from '@mui/lab/themeAugmentation';\n```\n\nWe use `import type {}` so that it will only utilize the type information and nothing else during bundling.\n\nIn Biome v1 there was no error, but Biome v2 triggers an error for `lint/correctness/noUnusedImports` and the fixer actually removes the statement which causes other issues. \n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow Biome's Code of Conduct",

Schema Refactor (Supabase)\n- Identify all instances of `owner_id` across the Supabase schema (tables, relationships, foreign keys).\n- Rename the columns to `kinder_id`, preserving existing constraints.\n- Create a properly versioned SQL migration file using Supabase CLI and place it under `services/supabase/migrations/`.\n- Validate database consistency after the rename through Supabase CLI and dashboard tools.\n\n### 2. Backend Adjustments (`services/supabase`)\n- Refactor all code references to `owner_id` across query logic, types, and service utilities.\n- Ensure all affected endpoints and mutations behave as expected with the updated schema.\n\n### 3. Frontend Integration (`apps/web`)\n- Update Supabase queries, types, and hooks that reference `owner_id`.\n- Refactor relevant components or forms handling project ownership or user metadata.\n- Run and update any impacted unit tests or mocks accordingly.\n\n### 4. Documentation\n- Update schema diagrams, ERD references, and technical documentation under `docs/` to reflect the updated field naming and align with project terminology.\n\n###  Deliverables\n- Fully working PR with schema + code changes.\n- A Supabase CLI-compatible SQL migration script.\n- Clear changelog and commit breakdown.\n- Optional: Schema diff or notes for internal dev reference.\n\n**ETA:** I estimate 36–48 hours for full implementation, testing, and documentation updates.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to take it! \nHappy to help standardize and improve the DB structure.\n", "# Hi there, @4c1d-V \uD83D\uDC4B You've been assigned this issue.\n\nOne invite is waiting for you in your email.

While for individual request, memory implications are small, it can starting adding up across all requests on a node.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nGiven we process buckets one at a time, they can be initialized lazily avoiding unnecessary memory allocations. This should also allow to raise the number of buckets limit from 3k to 10k or more \n\n### Related component\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

It is clear that many contributors are not reading the contributing.MD or the documentation update readme. \n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nWe are a welcoming community and we would like to include all regardless of their learning methodology. Some read, others watch. So, we would like a video to welcome contributors and walk them through the basics of contributing to KubeStellar. Once completed, we can create a shortcut url and give it to anyone with a question about making a contribution. This saves everyone time.\n\n### Are you willing to contribute?\n\n- [ ] Yes, I'd like to help implement this feature.\n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_",

For Windows users, you need to install `sudo` to execute commands with elevated privileges. Here are the steps to install `sudo` on Windows:\n\n### Installing `sudo` on Windows\n\n1. **Using Chocolatey:**\n   - If you don't have Chocolatey installed, you can install it by following the instructions on the [Chocolatey website](https://chocolatey.org/install).\n   - Once Chocolatey is installed, open a command prompt as an administrator and run:\n     ```bash\n     choco install gsudo\n     ```\n\n2. **Using Scoop:**\n   - If you don't have Scoop installed, you can install it by following the instructions on the [Scoop website](https://scoop.sh/).\n   - Once Scoop is installed, open a command prompt as an administrator and run:\n     ```bash\n     scoop install gsudo\n     ```\n\n3. **Using WinGet:**\n   - If you don't have WinGet installed, you can install it by following the instructions on the [WinGet website](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli).\n   - Once WinGet is installed, open a command prompt as an administrator and run:\n     ```bash\n     winget install gerardog.gsudo\n     ```\n\n## Installation Instructions for KubeFlex\n\n1. **Download the KubeFlex CLI:**\n   - Download the latest KubeFlex CLI binary release for your OS/Architecture from the [release page](https://github.com/kubestellar/kubeflex/releases) and copy it to `/usr/local/bin` or another location in your `$PATH`.\n\n   For example, on Linux amd64:\n   ```bash\n   OS_ARCH=linux_amd64\n   LATEST_RELEASE_URL=\\$(curl -H \"Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json\" https://api.github.com/repos/kubestellar/kubeflex/releases/latest | jq -r '.assets[] | select(.name | contains(\"linux_amd64\")) | .browser_download_url')\n   sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 <(curl -L \\$LATEST_RELEASE_URL) /usr/local/bin/kfle\n\n\n2.**Alternative Installation Command:**\nYou can also use the following command, which will automatically detect the host OS type and architecture:\n\n```\nsudo bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubestellar/kubeflex/main/scripts/install-kubeflex.sh) --ensure-folder /usr/local/bin\n\n```\n", "@Krishna-mishra-26 ty for your help here. This document would probably work best as a PR in the KubeFlex documentation. @pdettori where would you like this to be placed in source?

This means that, when executing the `createapp` command, new projects generated with this command use ESLint.\r\n\r\nBut the framework monorepo itself has not yet been migrated to ESLint. This is a technical debt that should be resolved.\r\n\r\n# Guidelines\r\n\r\n- ~If [this PR](https://github.com/FoalTS/foal/pull/1260), which updates the way dependencies are managed in monorepo, has not yet been merged, the new branch should be created from `v4-5-0`. Otherwise, it should be created from `master`. Not only will this facilitate the migration to ESLint, it will also avoid the need for additional work later on to manage ESLint dependencies with the new dependency system.~\r\n- Migration to ESLint should not change the style of the framework code (we don't want thousands of line changes to commit). A lot of work had been done at the time in [this PR](https://github.com/FoalTS/foal/pull/561) to make ESLint rules consistent with TSLint rules. There's probably a lot to be learned from this PR.\r\n- When opening the framework repository with VSCode with the ESLint plugin enabled, VSCode should correctly highlight ESLint errors and correct them when saving (if the plugin is configurer to do so).\r\n\r\n# Notes\r\n\r\n- There *might* be useful information [here](https://typescript-eslint.io/getting-started/typed-linting/monorepos/).\r\n- The files `packages/cli/src/generate/specs/app/.eslintrc.js` and `packages/cli/src/generate/templates/app/.eslintrc.js` used by `foal createapp` to generate new projects may cause problems.",

I'll let you choose what you think is the best solution.\n\nThe ideal solution where we want to go is this:\n- the method used in the monorepo framework should be the same as that used in new projects generated by `foal createapp`,\n- and the linting rules used in the monorepo framework should be the same as those used in new projects generated by `foal createapp`.\n\nIn this way, when we write documentation and copy-paste code from the framework, the examples are always correctly “linted” when users then copy-paste the same code into their projects.\n\n**Note 1:** if we have this ideal solution with the same rules and the `createapp` rules are still the same and there are linting errors that appear from the framework code, then we can fix them all. Go for it \uD83D\uDC4D \n\n**Note 2:** in tests of the directory `acceptance-tests/`, there are pieces of code that are between comments such as `======== DOCUMENTATION BEGIN =======` and `====== DOCUMENTATION END =======`. In this case, this means that these codes are present in the documentation and should be updated as well in the markdowns in case of modification. You can ignore files in `docs/versioned_docs/` and `docs/i18n/`.\n\nThank you so much, for taking care of this.

It would be useful to provide some type of automation around identifying:\n\n1. what en.yml strings do not have a corresponding localization for zh-CN.yml (what keys in en.yml do not exist in zh-CN.yml)\n1. what keys in zh-CN.yml do not exist in en.yml - these would be old keys in zh-CN.yml that may need removed, or they are misspelled keys\n1. if an en.yml string gets updated/modified, to flag which strings in zh-CN.yml need updated (this requires a clever git blame to determine the line number in the YAML file where a key starts and ensure the commit date of zh-CN.yml for a given key is greater than the commit date for the same key in en.yml. if en.yml is later that indicates that for this key the translation has been updated or modified and may need to be updated or modified for zh-CN. NOTE: a problem with this is if there is a false positive... like we fix a typo in the English or word it better but the Chinese is good and needs no update.. we could figure that out later). Could use https://www.rubydoc.info/github/libgit2/rugged/Rugged/Blame for this\n1. what strings in the application have not be internationalized (these strings are hardcoded)\n\nThere are many tools and approaches for this, but we want to keep deployment simple. The yaml files mean the translations stay with the code which is nice. Could probably use `for_line`. This also might encourage us to avoid multi-line strings in the locale files.\n\nMaybe a rake task is sufficient to start.\n\nAlso worth searching for existing tools that might assist with this as an alternative to writing our own.\n\n┆Issue is synchronized with this [Asana task](https://app.asana.com/0/1202821104799596/1204178484951391) by [Unito](https://www.unito.io)\n",

Most TMS support this out of the box, though there may also be examples of TMS projects that work with the Rails yaml formats. Another benefit of the gettext PO format is that its language/framework independent so if at some point we drop Rails or still have a mixture of Rails and other language/framework for apps in OnDemand, or want to translate error strings in Apache and/or NGINX as well, we can handle all of that in an language independent way.\r\n\r\nExamples: http://pootle.translatehouse.org/, http://zanata.org/ (RedHat product with free open source project support)\r\n\r\nSearch for \"open source translation management systems\" to see many options.", "Still thinking about this.

Feel free to develop on what would you expect from the cli and implementation details \n\nAs a workaround, you can create a shell alias to avoid typing the model name each time.

Now you can use `kai` followed by your prompt. For example:\n\n```sh\nkai \"I want to check the logs of logs.log and find \\n\"\n```\n\nThis will run the command with your input as the argument.\n\nYou can also come up with your own aliases based on your preferences and use cases", "In addition to what @zvdy suggested above, `kubectl-ai` also supports loading the configuration from a well defined path `~/.config/kubectl-ai/config.yaml`\n\nSo, you can do the following:\n\n```sh\n\nmkdir ~/.config/kubectl-ai/\ncat <<EOF > ~/.config/kubectl-ai/config.yaml\nmodel: gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17\nEOF\n\n```\n\nAfter this, you can confirm, the model using:\n\n```sh\nkubectl-ai --quiet model\n```\n\nEverything listed in [this struct](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubectl-ai/blob/main/cmd/main.go#L80) can be configured through this YAML file.\n\nAs you can see, documentation is lacking, feel free to make a PR for updating the README.md, I will be happy to review and get that in.\n\nLet me know if helps.\n\n/cc @noahlwest ", "Thanks a lot @zvdy, I was using an alias like the one you provided already, but I was looking for a better way, something like `kubectl-ai config`.\n\nThanks @droot, I'll work on the issue and keep you updated.", "I like the config approach, a profile like env file or something similar\n\nReminds me of a different feature for context resumption, so I can resume context for LLMs in sessions, so you don't have to explain again what it did and the steps performed yesterday or any other day and makes managing multiple clusters more easy\n\nFeel free to give it a try/PR and own it, I will also peek into that if I manage to get the time", "I updated the documentation in the [PR](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubectl-ai/pull/355).

Type inference is guaranteed in a valid model, but shape inference is on \"best effort\" basis. For some operators (e.g., GridSample, Gather, Reshape, Where, etc), shape inference may fail due to incomplete or complex shape logic, even when type inference could succeed. \nThis tight coupling prevents users from recovering type information when shape inference is unsupported or fails. For example, when users attempt to inject cast nodes or quantize nodes and propagate the type information downstream.\n\n\n**Request:**\nPlease consider adding an option to ONNX’s shape inference API to:\n- Run type inference independently of shape inference, so that type information can be propagated even when shape inference fails or is not implemented for an operator.\n- Alternatively, relax the requirement that shape inference must succeed for type inference to run.\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Enables users and downstream tools to recover and validate type information in more models, improving robustness and usability.\n- Reduces manual workarounds (such as manually setting types for affected nodes).\n- Makes ONNX models more portable and easier to analyze, even when shape logic is incomplete.\n\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n1. Create a separate function to support only type inference `infer_types` (preferable) \n2.

      "url" : "https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy/issues/9094",
      "repositoryName" : "aquasecurity/trivy",
      "description" : "## Description\n\nThis is a feature request to add SHA-512 hash algorithm support to Trivy's SBOM parsing capabilities. Currently, Trivy only supports SHA-1, SHA-256, and MD5 hash algorithms when processing SBOM files.\n\nSome tools, particularly NPM's SBOM generation (`npm sbom`), use SHA-512 hashes for package integrity verification. Adding SHA-512 support would enable Trivy to fully process these SBOMs and preserve important security metadata.\n\n### Current limitations:\n- **CycloneDX**: SHA-512 hashes are ignored and the hashes field becomes `null`\n- **SPDX**: SHA-512 checksums are completely omitted from the output\n\n\n## Current Behavior\n\n### CycloneDX\nIn `pkg/sbom/cyclonedx/unmarshal.go:251-268`, the `unmarshalHashes` function only supports:\n- SHA1\n- SHA256\n- MD5\n\nAny other algorithm (including SHA-512) logs a warning but still creates a digest with an empty algorithm prefix (e.g., `:hashvalue` instead of `sha512:hashvalue`), resulting in malformed digest strings.\n\n### SPDX\nIn `pkg/sbom/spdx/marshal.go:501-522`, the `spdxChecksums` function has the same limitation, returning `nil` for unsupported algorithms.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe limitation stems from `pkg/digest/digest.go` which only defines three algorithms:\n```go\nconst (\n    SHA1   Algorithm = \"sha1\"\n    SHA256 Algorithm = \"sha256\"\n    MD5    Algorithm = \"md5\"\n)\n```\n\n## Desired Behavior\n\nTrivy should support SHA-512 hash algorithm alongside the existing SHA-1, SHA-256, and MD5 support. This would enable Trivy to:\n- Preserve SHA-512 hashes when processing SBOMs from NPM and other tools\n- Generate SBOMs with SHA-512 hashes when appropriate\n- Maintain full compatibility with CycloneDX and SPDX specifications\n\n\n## Impact\n\n- Loss of package integrity verification data\n- Generated SBOMs may be invalid or incomplete\n- Affects tools that rely on SHA-512 for security validation\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n1. Add SHA512 constant to `pkg/digest/digest.go`:\n   ```go\n   const (\n       SHA1   Algorithm = \"sha1\"\n       SHA256 Algorithm = \"sha256\"\n       SHA512 Algorithm = \"sha512\"\n       MD5    Algorithm = \"md5\"\n   )\n   ```\n\n2. Add SHA-512 calculation support in the digest package\n\n3. Update `unmarshalHashes` in CycloneDX:\n   ```go\n   case cdx.HashAlgoSHA512:\n       alg = digest.SHA512\n   ```\n\n4. Update `spdxChecksums` in SPDX:\n   ```go\n   case digest.SHA512:\n       alg = spdx.SHA512\n   ```\n\n## References\n\n- NPM SBOM documentation: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npm-sbom\n- CycloneDX hash algorithm specification: https://cyclonedx.org/docs/1.6/json/#components_items_hashes\n- SPDX checksum specification: https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/package-information/#79-package-checksum-field\n\n## Test Data\n\n### CycloneDX Example\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"http://cyclonedx.org/schema/bom-1.5.schema.json\",\n  \"bomFormat\": \"CycloneDX\",\n  \"specVersion\": \"1.5\",\n  \"components\": [\n    {\n      \"bom-ref\": \"lodash@4.17.21\",\n      \"type\": \"library\",\n      \"name\": \"lodash\",\n      \"version\": \"4.17.21\",\n      \"hashes\": [\n        {\n          \"alg\": \"SHA-512\",\n          \"content\": \"bf690311ee7b95e713ba568322e3533f2dd1cb880b189e99d4edef13592b81764daec43e2c54c61d5c558dc5cfb35ecb85b65519e74026ff17675b6f8f916f4a\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### SPDX Example\n```json\n{\n  \"spdxVersion\": \"SPDX-2.3\",\n  \"packages\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"lodash\",\n      \"SPDXID\": \"SPDXRef-Package-lodash-4.17.21\",\n      \"checksums\": [\n        {\n          \"algorithm\": \"SHA512\",\n          \"checksumValue\": \"bf690311ee7b95e713ba568322e3533f2dd1cb880b189e99d4edef13592b81764daec43e2c54c61d5c558dc5cfb35ecb85b65519e74026ff17675b6f8f916f4a\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Discussed in https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy/discussions/9082\n",

It is located here in VDatePicker.tsx line 232 where allowedMonths function is executed.\nHere line  234 looks like this:\n```js\nconst startOfMonth = adapter.parseISO(`${year.value}-${month + 1}-01`)\n```\nGiven month is from January (index 0) to September (index 8) \"month + 1\" resolves to single digit and startOfMonth date resolves to e.g. 2025-1-01, which results in \"Invalid date\" and month gets disabled.\nI found a utility used in framework \"padStart\", which can be used like this:\n```js\nconst month = padStart(String(date.getMonth() + 1), 2, '0');\n```\nThis would result in a month with 2 digits always (e.g. January would be 01).\nWith the fix it could look like this:\n```js\nif (typeof props.allowedDates === 'function') {\n        const formattedMonth = padStart(String(month + 1), 2, '0');\n        const startOfMonth = adapter.parseISO(`${year.value}-${formattedMonth}-01`);\n        return isAllowedInRange(startOfMonth, adapter.endOfMonth(startOfMonth));\n}\n```\nIf it's ok I can make a PR." ],

Instead of only considering bindings for attribute assignments, we need to consider both bindings and declarations. Declarations are already correctly recorded in the semantic index, but in type inference, we currently only access the bindings. The patch below may be useful as a reference to see which places in the source code need to change. It switches everything from bindings-only to declarations-only (which would fix the issue here), but of course that needs to be extended to consider both.\n\nJust like when resolving references to normal variables, declarations should take precedence over bindings. That is, even if we see conflicting definitions such as `self.x: int` and `self.x = \"a string\"`, the type of the `x` attribute should just be `int`.\n\n<details>\n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/semantic_index.rs b/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/semantic_index.rs\nindex d4f848e69d..9be2b157d7 100644\n--- a/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/semantic_index.rs\n+++ b/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/semantic_index.rs\n@@ -108,7 +108,7 @@ pub(crate) fn attribute_assignments<'db, 's>(\n     db: &'db dyn Db,\n     class_body_scope: ScopeId<'db>,\n     name: &'s str,\n-) -> impl Iterator<Item = (BindingWithConstraintsIterator<'db, 'db>, FileScopeId)> + use<'s, 'db> {\n+) -> impl Iterator<Item = (DeclarationsIterator<'db, 'db>, FileScopeId)> + use<'s, 'db> {\n     let file = class_body_scope.file(db);\n     let index = semantic_index(db, file);\n \n@@ -116,7 +116,7 @@ pub(crate) fn attribute_assignments<'db, 's>(\n         let place_table = index.place_table(function_scope_id);\n         let place = place_table.place_id_by_instance_attribute_name(name)?;\n         let use_def = &index.use_def_maps[function_scope_id];\n-        Some((use_def.public_bindings(place), function_scope_id))\n+        Some((use_def.public_declarations(place), function_scope_id))\n     })\n }\n \ndiff --git a/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/semantic_index/use_def.rs b/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/semantic_index/use_def.rs\nindex 8ac7f91811..978ce2de7a 100644\n--- a/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/semantic_index/use_def.rs\n+++ b/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/semantic_index/use_def.rs\n@@ -463,10 +463,10 @@ impl<'db> UseDefMap<'db> {\n             .is_always_false()\n     }\n \n-    pub(crate) fn is_binding_reachable(\n+    pub(crate) fn is_declaration_reachable(\n         &self,\n         db: &dyn crate::Db,\n-        binding: &BindingWithConstraints<'_, 'db>,\n+        binding: &DeclarationWithConstraint<'db>,\n     ) -> Truthiness {\n         self.reachability_constraints.evaluate(\n             db,\ndiff --git a/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/types/class.rs b/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/types/class.rs\nindex 3cd7bffa5b..371291a94a 100644\n--- a/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/types/class.rs\n+++ b/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/types/class.rs\n@@ -1744,10 +1744,10 @@ impl<'db> ClassLiteral<'db> {\n                     let method = index.expect_single_definition(method_def);\n                     let method_place = class_table.place_id_by_name(&method_def.name).unwrap();\n                     class_map\n-                        .public_bindings(method_place)\n-                        .find_map(|bind| {\n-                            (bind.binding.is_defined_and(|def| def == method))\n-                                .then(|| class_map.is_binding_reachable(db, &bind))\n+                        .public_declarations(method_place)\n+                        .find_map(|decl| {\n+                            (decl.declaration.is_defined_and(|def| def == method))\n+                                .then(|| class_map.is_declaration_reachable(db, &decl))\n                         })\n                         .unwrap_or(Truthiness::AlwaysFalse)\n                 } else {\n@@ -1762,7 +1762,7 @@ impl<'db> ClassLiteral<'db> {\n             let mut unbound_binding = None;\n \n             for attribute_assignment in attribute_assignments {\n-                if let DefinitionState::Undefined = attribute_assignment.binding {\n+                if let DefinitionState::Undefined = attribute_assignment.declaration {\n                     // Store the implicit unbound binding here so that we can delay the\n                     // computation of `unbound_reachability` to the point when we actually\n                     // need it.

These buttons should allow users to share the post on popular platforms such as:\n\n    Twitter\n    LinkedIn\n\nEach button should generate a pre-filled sharing link, including the blog post title, URL, and possibly hashtags. For example:\n\n```Twitter: https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Check+out+this+blog!&url=https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/2024-annual-summary#social-media```\n\nThe buttons should be visually appealing, lightweight, and non-intrusive.

      "description" : "Part of #12048\n\n## Issue\nAfter most of the Unit Test migration in #12048, there are a lot of inconsistencies in access control test methods. This is because we did not migrate the many convenient, abstracted, and commonly used access control test methods from `ui/webapi/BaseActionTest.java` to `sqlui/webapi/BaseActionTest.java`.\n\nAfter merging #13254, all of the access control test methods in `BaseActionTest.java` have been migrated. Hence, this issue aims to refactor the unit test access controls to use these convenient test methods.\n\n## Progress\nThe progress for this refactoring can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IcB-viJMrIOknYoBYasBuRBK9qnwY0-doEK4_Eb24IA/edit?gid=0#gid=0). I (the author) will update it when completed PRs are merged proactively.\n\n## Steps to Contribute\n\n1. Choose test(s) to work on in the above Google Sheets link\n2. Check that no on else have claimed the test cases to work on within the last 2 weeks, or that it has been completed by follow up PRs (but not updated in the sheets)\n3. Comment on this issue to indicate that you'd like to contribute on the chosen test(s). Update your comment if you need more than 2 weeks so that other contributors don't overlap with your work.\n4. Create a PR to refactor the unit test(s).\n5. Submit the PR, with a link to this issue by starting the description with \"Part of #13304\"## Tips\n\n- Understand the access control test methods in `sqlui/webapi/BaseActionTest.java`, follow the refactoring in #13254\n- Most of the access control testing logic in the migrated unit tests under `sqlui/webapi` follows the old unit tests under `ui/webapi`, so you may wish to reference the old unit test for help",

      "description" : "## Feature Description\n\nWhen a button has a related \"in progress\" state such as a navigation or background request, we don't always handle this consistently. This is similar to #10281 but specific to the appearance.\n\nFor example, when saving settings [we include an ellipsis](https://github.com/google/site-kit-wp/blob/8f1c16bb71bcf5091bc5b56d535e03973d4b9b36/assets/js/components/settings/SettingsActiveModule/Footer.js#L153-L155), but in nearly all other similar buttons we do not.\n\n---------------\n\n_Do not alter or remove anything below. The following sections will be managed by moderators only._\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n\n* When module settings are being saved, after CTA has been clicked and CTA enters in progress state, only spinner icon should be showing, text shouldn't be changing to the `Saving` and ellipsis should not show `...`\n\n## Implementation Brief\n\n* [ ] Update `assets/js/components/settings/SettingsActiveModule/FooterPrimaryAction.js`\n  * Remove https://github.com/google/site-kit-wp/blob/4946f1a5df79dfac2ac8f94c6a03283a163241a1/assets/js/components/settings/SettingsActiveModule/FooterPrimaryAction.js#L75 and conditional wrapper around it.\n  * Spinner is already integrated, so no further change is needed\n\n### Test Coverage\n\n* No updates expected\n\n## QA Brief\n\n* <!-- One or more bullet points for how to test that the feature works as expected. -->\n\n## Changelog entry\n\n* <!-- One sentence summarizing the PR, to be used in the changelog. -->\n",

However, the referenced GitHub issue (https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/issues/2400) is closed.\n\nThe [Swift Syntax 600 release notes](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/blob/main/Release%20Notes/600.md) mentions `SwiftSyntaxMacrosGenericTestSupport`.  \n\nHere is a snippet of the relevant Swift Syntax release notes\n\n> `SwiftSyntaxMacrosGenericTestSupport`\n> - Description: A version of the `SwiftSyntaxMacrosTestSupport` module that doesn't depend on `Foundation` or `XCTest` and can thus be used to write macro tests using `swift-testing`. Since swift-syntax can't depend on swift-testing (which would incur a circular dependency since swift-testing depends on swift-syntax), users need to manually specify a failure handler like the following, that fails the swift-testing test: `Issue.record(\"\\($0.message)\", fileID: $0.location.fileID, filePath: $0.location.filePath, line: $0.location.line, column: $0.location.column)`\n> - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2647\n\n\nThe SwiftPM template for `swift package init --type macro` should be update to provide an idiomatic way to write a Swift Testing test to verify and validate a macro.\n\n",

Go to a product page\n2. Go to the \"prices\" tab\n3. You'll see a badge counting the number of prices\n4. If it's more than 10, click on the button.\n5. You'll land on a page with only 10 prices, with no way to get more.\n\n### Expected behavior\nWe should have the same behavior in both \"product price\" pages.\n\n### Screenshot/Mockup/Before-After\nIssue - 30 prices but only top 10 are visible\n| 30 prices | but 10 prices | and 10 prices |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/693bedca-74c1-42ab-95c0-6be7c199ea6f) | ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32b5e93b-03ad-404c-98ba-4784dce54dc8) | ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f8d0584-5687-4ef3-89ca-94c3fd19b846) |\n\nCorrect - 30 prices and all of them are visible after scrolling down\n| 30 prices | top 10 prices | then 30 prices |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86a62c2e-8a9f-44a6-a68a-c2ab26c31f42) | ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13aef8eb-e7d8-481e-a753-ac1e2776d483) | ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a06f2e41-962c-458a-9716-c55497921a0d) |",

The contribution consists of number of activity performed on each tasks, meaning the lock and unlock of tasks or update of tasks status. \n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n\n1. Go to 'project details page'\n2. Click on 'view submissions'\n3. Scroll down to 'total contribution table'\n4. See error\n\n**Expected behavior**\nModify the total contributors table to show number of submissions per user including new features submissions. \n\n**Alternative solution**\nAdd an info icon to clarify users that the table consists of number of activity performed on each tasks that is stored on task history table and maynot match with number of submissions user has sent.\n\n**Screenshots**\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f788ab1-b16c-4f3b-82c0-b80830c488fd)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f22d2418-fbfc-46a7-a879-a02132e96714)\n\n**Additional context**\nThis confusion was raised by KU field mapathon. \n",

      "description" : "### Steps to reproduce\n\nUse the code below or try dartpad:\n[https://dartpad.dev/?id=06c010125e651e2bfadeecbff2db181a](https://dartpad.dev/?id=06c010125e651e2bfadeecbff2db181a)\nI tested it on the main branch and on the stable one.\n\n### Expected results\n\n`PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber` should return actual frame number on the Web, just like on other platforms.\n\n### Actual results\n\nOn the web `PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber` returns always -1.\nI have tested the code below on the desktop (Windows) and it returns the correct ascending frame numbers. But on the web (via `flutter run -d chrome` or dartpad) this method always returns -1.\nI also found two strange behaviors (potential bugs?).\n1. `frameNumber` has the old value until the end of the transientCallbacks phase. If this is not a bug, it should be documented. The picture below shows a different number in different callbacks during a frame. (underlined in blue)\n2.  `scheduleMicrotask` method calls its callback after the frame ends on the web, and not between `onBeginFrame` and `onDrawFrame` as expected (underlined in red). On the desktop (Windows) it works correctly.\n\n### Code sample\n\n<details open><summary>Code sample</summary>\n\n```dart\nimport 'dart:async';\nimport 'dart:ui';\n\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:flutter/scheduler.dart' show SchedulerBinding, Ticker;\n\nvoid main() {\n  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();\n\n  // ignore: invalid_use_of_protected_member\n  SchedulerBinding.instance.ensureFrameCallbacksRegistered();\n\n  final onBeginFrame = PlatformDispatcher.instance.onBeginFrame;\n  final onDrawFrame = PlatformDispatcher.instance.onDrawFrame;\n\n  PlatformDispatcher.instance.onBeginFrame = (Duration elapsed) {\n    print('+' * 30);\n    final frameNumber = PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber;\n    print('frameNumber from onBeginFrame callback: $frameNumber');\n    onBeginFrame!(elapsed);\n    print('___finish onBeginFrame');\n  };\n\n  PlatformDispatcher.instance.onDrawFrame = () {\n    print('___start onDrawFrame');\n    onDrawFrame!();\n    final frameNumber = PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber;\n    print('frameNumber from onDrawFrame callback: $frameNumber');\n    print('-' * 30);\n  };\n\n  runApp(const App());\n}\n\nclass App extends StatelessWidget {\n  const App({super.key});\n\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return const MaterialApp(debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false, home: Home());\n  }\n}\n\nclass Home extends StatefulWidget {\n  const Home({super.key});\n\n  @override\n  State<Home> createState() => _HomeState();\n}\n\nclass _HomeState extends State<Home> with TickerProviderStateMixin {\n  Ticker? ticker;\n\n  @override\n  void initState() {\n    super.initState();\n\n    SchedulerBinding.instance.addPersistentFrameCallback((_) {\n      final frameNumber = PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber;\n      print('frameNumber from the persistent callback: $frameNumber');\n    });\n\n    ticker = createTicker((_) {\n      final frameNumber = PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber;\n      print('frameNumber from the transient callback: $frameNumber');\n      scheduleMicrotask(() {\n        final frameNumber = PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber;\n        print('frameNumber from the microtask callback: $frameNumber');\n      });\n      SchedulerBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback((_) {\n        final frameNumber = PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber;\n        print('frameNumber from the postframe callback: $frameNumber');\n      });\n    })..start();\n\n    Timer(const Duration(seconds: 1), () {\n      ticker?.dispose();\n      ticker = null;\n    });\n  }\n\n  @override\n  void dispose() {\n    ticker?.dispose();\n    super.dispose();\n  }\n\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return const Placeholder();\n  }\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Screenshots or Video\n\n<details open>\n<summary>Screenshots / Video demonstration</summary>\n\nOn the desktop:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abca8f1d-4d88-4d5a-988e-974c58d0052e)\n\nOn the web:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fcfb6c2-ea1e-4c92-b62f-d7a800e01791)\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Logs\n\n\n\n\n### Flutter Doctor output\n\n<details open><summary>Doctor output</summary>\n\n```console\n[√] Flutter (Channel main, 3.33.0-1.0.pre.619, on Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.19045.5965], locale ru-RU)\n[√] Windows Version (Њ ©Єа®б®дв Windows 10 Pro 64-а §ап¤­ п, 22H2, 2009)\n[√] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 34.0.0)\n[√] Chrome - develop for the web\n[√] Visual Studio - develop Windows apps (Visual Studio Build Tools 2022 17.6.5)\n[√] Android Studio (version 2022.2)\n[√] VS Code (version 1.101.1)\n[√] Connected device (4 available)\n[√] Network resources\n\n• No issues found!\n```\n\n</details>\n",

If you want to contribute something relatively small feel free to update one (or more) and make a pull request. A rough list of easy plots/recipes:\n- [ ] arc\n- [ ] band\n- [ ] pie\n- [ ] poly\n- [ ] stairs\n- [ ] stem\n- [ ] tooltip\n- [ ] wireframe\n- [ ] density\n- [ ] qqplot (distributions.jl)\n- [ ] stephist\n- [ ] hist\n- [ ] timeseries\n- [ ] series\n\nSome recipes still use `register_computation!()` when they could use `map!()`. This should be a fairly easy cleanup/replacement as well.\n- [ ] tricontourf\n- [ ] spy\n- [ ] scatterlines\n\nSome recipes may require some more refactoring, like breaking up an `onany` that updates multiple observables. They should still be fairly easy to translate (though I haven't checked in depth). `contourf` or `errorbars` might be an instructive example.\n- [ ] arrows\n- [ ] barplot\n- [ ] contour\n- [ ] triplot\n- [ ] waterfall\n- [ ] boxplot\n- [ ] crossbar\n- [ ] hexbin\n- [ ] violin\n\nSome recipes apply transformations and projections. These should probably be delayed a bit, as we can/should extend what's happening for primitive plots to recipe plots here\n- ~~hlines, vlines, hspan, vspan (+ limit tracking)~~\n- [ ] annotation (+ bbox handling)\n- [ ] bracket\n- [ ] streamplot (or maybe refactor rotation handling?)\n- [ ] textlabel\n- [ ] voronoiplot\n\nOther:\n- [ ] volumeslices (how do we want to handle the transformation system)\n\nNot sure if done:\n- [ ] axis3d (maybe needs full rework?)\n- [ ] datashader\n- [ ] rainclouds",

We just display the price and so on.\n- We should display the category (mandatory), the origins (optional), the labels (optional) and the \"price per\" (unit/kg) (mandatory)\n\n### Steps to reproduce the behavior\n1. Go to a price list like \"My prices\"\n2. All the \"no barcode\" products display nothing about the product itself.\n\n### Expected behavior\nWe should have the minimum about a \"no barcode\" product.\nWithout it, we just know that there's a price, but we don't know if we bought apricots or salmon.\n\n### Screenshot\nHere, the first price is about a \"no barcode\" product:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df97ab10-e158-404a-9495-8babfad05801)\n",

For example : \n\n```nvidia/cuda:12.9.0-runtime-ubuntu24.04```\n\nThis comes to ~ 2 GB/3 GB depending on the exact CUDA and Ubuntu Version being used. \n\nIdeally run automated tests/builds for different combinations of Ubuntu (or other distributions?) and CUDA  versions. \n\n## CPU vs GPU preliminary testing\n\nA very simple test on TabPFN using a [Sci-Kit Learn Breast Cancer Dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html) showed approximately 3x-4x speed ups when GPU access to the process was enabled, compared to CPU only runs (on the Norrsken GPU Workstation).\n\nMore detailed tests using a [Dataset of approximately 2 Million Compounds](https://github.com/ersilia-os/sars-cov-2-chemspace/blob/main/data/reference_library_inchikeys.csv) showed overwhelming speed-ups with GPU Accelerated similarity searches using [FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss), the difference between search times of GPU and CPU implementations scaled/diverged with the Index size. **It is clearly worth trying to accelerate models using GPU Acceleration.**\n\nWe built indices out of Count Fingerprints of the compounds (converted the SMILES to 2048 Vectors). Cosine Similarity was used as a metric. \n\nFAISS does not support cosine by default, so we use  an `Inner Product` index and perform L2 (Euclidean) Normalisation on the vectors before adding to them to the index (or before searching), which is the equivalent of using Cosine similarity.\n\nTests were ran with index sizes of `10,000`, `100,000`, `500,000` and `1,000,000`. Nearest 100 Neighbours. \n\n### Index size 100,000:\n| Number of Searches | CPU (s) | GPU (s) |\n|--------------------|---------|---------|\n| 100                | 1       | 0.01    |\n| 1,000              | 7.08    | 0.04    |\n| 10,000             | 67.49   | 0.11    |\n| 100,000            | >350    | 1.30    |\n| 500,000            | -       | 5.50    |\n\n### Index size 1,000,000\n\n| Number of Searches | CPU (s) | GPU (s) |\n|--------------------|---------|---------|\n| 100                | 9.42    | 0.02    |\n| 1,000              | 71      | 0.10    |\n| 10,000             | 711     | 1.03    |\n| 100,000            | -       | 10.45   |\n| 500,000            | -       | 52.50   |\n\n\n\n### \n\n<img width=\"765\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e39adae0-7c06-43ba-ba5f-3da89037da02\" />\n\n_NOTE: GPUs are typically higher latency but have higher parallel throughput and memory bandwidth than CPUs. It is best to use batch queries with the CPU or GPU as this amortises the touching of index memory across all of the queries and this is when GPU speed ups are convenient. We will most likely not see any improvements in GPU search times with single queries (if anything it might be slower because of GPU overhead)._\n\n\nThe examples of inference time comparisons and a 3D plot (inference time against index and query sizes), clearly demonstrate **GPUs provide absolutely non-trivial speed ups for the right tasks.**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "# Very Heavy Index (FAISS Flat)\n\nFlat (IP and L2 for example) indices are extremely large (because FAISS only supports Float32 vectors, hence each Fingerprint vector is 32 * 2048 = 65,536 Bits or 4 * 2048=8,192  Bytes), scaling up to millions of vectors means we are dealing with indices that are 10s of GBs.\n\nTried FPSim2 but there are no benefits to GPU accelerating since it does not support batch queries (could be worth looking into CUDA Programming and tuning it to support batch queries, as it supports Sparse Vectors and Tanimoto Search on GPU)\n\n## Promising alternative to Flat FAISS Index: **Approximate Nearest Neighbour (ANN) search**\n\nMost methods for ANN require index training and parameter tuning which makes building the index more complex. We also need to ensure that the training sample is diverse. \n\nPlease note the difference between training and adding to Indices. And index cannot be trained incrementally but can be incrementally added to.\n\nMemory bottlenecks are also an issue so I first train the index and then add vectors to it incrementally in batches. (Although, it is suggested, If possible at all,  add more compute at index build time. (Especially if the index does not change a lot over time))\n\nThe following ANN methods are explored and suggested (compared to ~16 GB with a flat index of around 1.99 million Vectors)\n\n### **_IVFPQ (Inverted File Index with Product Quantisation):_** \n\n#### **_I am yet to do Accuracy tests on IVFPQ but with computational performance (inference time), models seem to enjoy GPU Acceleration speed ups similar to those mentioned above for FAISS Flat indices._**\n\nThis creates very light indices: `~93 MB for an index of around 1.99 Million Vectors`, but there might be a non-trivial loss of accuracy. \n\nNote: For some reason after the index is trained and incrementally built, FAISS takes a lot of time to write it to disk which makes it look like the process is frozen but isn't actually frozen - it goes into an \"uninterruptible sleep\" because of Disk IO, as indicated by the \"D\" state in htop. \n\n### **_HNSWSQ (Hierarchical Navigable Small World Index with Scalar Quantisation)_**\n\nTraining is reasonably fast (with GPU) but adding vectors is computationally intensive and needs to batched appropriately.\n\n#### **_I am yet to do Accuracy tests on HNSWSQ but with computational performance , HNSW seem to enjoy GPU Acceleration only with at Training time as indices are pretty compact and are VERY FAST with CPU and FAISS does not have a GPU search for this yet._**\n\nWhen choosing the strength of quantisation, there is a trade off between memory and accuracy:\n\nIndex of **1.99 million Vectors**:\n\n```\n4.63 GB (~2KB Per Vector + overhead) with a  8-Bit Quantiser while maintaining around 95-98% Accuracy^\n\n\n\n2.59 GB (~1.15KB Per Vector + overhead) with a 4-Bit Quantiser  while maintaining around 90-95% Accuracy^\n```\n\n\nAdding vectors to this kind of index is slow.\n\n_^accuracy according to official documentation and third party tests_\n", "# Metric Learning - Embedding Model\n\nAnother alternative to using vanilla flat indices with 2048 dimensional fingerprints we explore is the use of a metric learning model to create embeddings that are lower dimensions. We use these embeddings to create flat FAISS indices that are much lighter than the standard fingerprint indices (512, 256, 128, 100 dimensional embeddings vs 2048 dimensional fingerprints). We uses torch's GPU version and enjoy non-trivial speed-ups at training time, while creating embeddings and inference time (FAISS Search using a GPU index).\n\nNote: The searches are performed on a flat index, hence are exact searches, but the using of the embedding model means there is an approximation.", "We are aiming to create compound similarity search models with 4 compound libraries:\n\n- ChemDiv (100k)\n- A representative of Enamine  (~9 million)\n- DrugBank (~11k)\n- COCONUT (should be between 500k and 1 Million)\n\nWe also create a _Metric Learning Embedding Model_ out of a [reference library of 2 million compounds.](https://github.com/ersilia-os/sars-cov-2-chemspace/blob/main/data/reference_library_inchikeys.csv).\n\nFor each of the above libraries the aim is to have 3 variants of indices:\n\n- _A flat IP index with L2 Normalisation_\n    - This is going to be very large for libraries with 500k+ compounds)\n\n- _A compressed IVFPQ IP index  with L2 normalisation (FAISS compression)_\n   - This creates very light indices but as mentioned above there is a loss of search accuracy\n\n- _A flat index created with embeddings from the above mentioned model._\n   - This is lets us create indices that are lighter than vanilla flat indices and also lets us have control and confidence over the accuracy of the search (given that we are confident in the embedding model, which is arguably simpler to benchmark).\n \n", "Implemented a metric learning pipeline that creates learned embeddings from existing flat FAISS index. \n\n### Transforms 2048-dimensional fingerprints → _256/128/100-dimensional learned embeddings_ with cosine similarity\n\n### Triplet sampling: Uses existing 2M compound FAISS index for mining hard positives/negatives\n\nEvaluations: ROC-AUC, AP, distance distributions, t-SNE visualizations\n\nThe pipeline maintains L2 normalization throughout for FlatIP cosine similarity and includes model checkpointing + SMILES mapping for deployment.\n\nCreated with PyTorch + FAISS GPU.

Please describe.\n1. Comment section is still not matching the designs. The whitespace is lacking between the nested comments and the visually it looks tight, packed and overwhelming.\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6340e9d-7671-4308-acd0-10bf42bffd4b)\n\n2. Additionally the comment on mobile has spacing from the left, leaving the space not being utilised and making the text unnecessarily squeezed.\n<img width=\"361\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28e206b7-fbe6-471c-a2c4-8f09b1284eeb\" />\n\nEspecially with nested comments it becomes obvious:\n<img width=\"361\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86610c32-e365-414c-868e-02621ca54564\" />\n\n3. If the comment has some enters for new line and the the Show more button shows, it creates an awkward space. There is also gap applied.\n<img width=\"918\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a76486ea-e490-4860-940e-c49498ebeb1e\" />\n\n## Describe the solution you'd like\n\nGenerally I think this will need not only adjusting the numbers, but some minor restructuring of the divs. So, let me try to number the improvements:\n\n---\n\n1. Improving the spacings between the nested comments. In the designs there are also the useful buttons in each comment, that are not yet implemented. In the design however, the spacing occurs naturally because of the useful buttons, so I did not need to add a big margin-bottom. I will leave the solution here up to you, but account for the fact that one day in the future we will introduce the useful button for the comment.\n<img width=\"670\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00f1a492-0cfe-4a26-a6d4-a25e9f1e81d2\" />\n\nDon't be afraid to be generous with the spacings, in the devtools i tried 50px as in my designs\n<img width=\"978\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f23db889-05ba-4607-bedc-25d4a4abc321\" />\n\n---\n\n2. Mobile improvement. Here I upload a gif of the solution that I utilised in the Figma designs - it was to hide the left column with the avatar, allowing the text to stretch and then showing the avatar next to the username in 30x30px size.\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/329f7267-8bdb-4d18-a47c-73b7e44d5478)\n\nDon't forget to make sure that the author's badge is working \n<img width=\"502\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b3012c1-567c-4e5e-b781-5f81852bbe28\" />\n\n\n---\n\n3. Putting the Show More button directly under the comment, trimming the whitespaces. \n<img width=\"947\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c07017f7-60f7-4c1c-92f4-859c1267736f\" />\n\n\n---\n\n4. Decreasing the gap here to 5px from 10px\n<img width=\"404\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a1c56f9-11f3-4bd0-9e52-239948b15c2f\" />\n\n\n\n---\n\n5. As you can see, on mobile it gets quite tight. I would suggest removing the word Published from the \"Published x time ago\" information for the comments.\n<img width=\"322\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe06174a-b402-452b-a18b-eefd38b03192\" />\n\n\n---\n\n6. OPTIONAL - In case you would want to act on the point 5. above even more, I would suggest for mobile screens shortening the formulation even more, saying for example 1h ago, 3mo ago or 2yr ago. Reddit does it this way as well.\n\n<img width=\"182\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c194f4c-a4ee-42a1-9c59-dcd5c6b77e42\" />\n\n---\n\n7. OPTIONAL - In case you would still be up for a challenge, having these 2 aligned on the baseline would be a nice achievement, however I didn't manage to get the desired result, since as you can see below, the align-items:baseline does not align them.\n<img width=\"742\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27968c77-de84-400a-8d3f-22e88b37b627\" />\n\n\n\n##  Additional context - [FIGMA FILE HERE](https://www.figma.com/design/XYV3fr8UVOdkNyBmKHHR7f/CP---Comments-Useful---Mobile?node-id=48-79)\nYou can find the figma file above. You can see the components, the desktop and the mobile versions. These design include the correct answer feature or the useful buttons, which are not yet implemented, so feel free to ignore those.\n\n<img width=\"761\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/119c7345-44cf-4baa-9ef6-feed6a05d7ad\" />\n\nIf you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask. :))",

I'd be happy to include that as well.", "Heyy @JCSergent! Cool to see that you are up for tackling these design improvements. \n\nJust yesterday we were talking with Ben, that this issue was in his opinion hard to follow and that the screenshots I included could be a bit confusing (some of them with the useful button, some without), so I thought about rewriting it. Is the issue clear to you though? If so, than let's keep it and if you find anything even slightly unclear you can tag me in the comments at any time and I'll be happy to give more clarification. :))\n\nAlso Ben mentioned that he does not have the capacity to prioritise this at the moment, so this would actually be really really helpful and valuable contribution from you. <3\n\nBen was also wrote yesterday that some of the points I mentioned were implemented already. After checking, it was only the point 5. - removing the word \"Published\" from the timestamp.\n\nI will ask the team about implementing the useful counter and let you know. :))", "@dalibormrska  - I think I understand it, but here let me try to summarize and let me know if I am understanding your requests correctly.\n\n\nRequest 1: Increase spacing between the nested comments.\nSolutions:\n- Long Term Solution: Add the Useful Counter to comments which will naturally add whitespace between the comments\n- Easier Solution: Manually add whitespace between the nested comments (which is the space the Useful Counter will take up later)\n\nRequest 2: When viewing comments (especially reply comments) in mobile, the comment text is extremely narrow.\nSolution: Remove the left side margin (make the comment text and profile image be on the same vertical line). Use the smaller version of the profile picture. Basically try to get to this design:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4045704-088e-4a7c-a7ff-bf3d1c5535b3)\n\nRequest 3: If a comment has alot of line breaks, there could be an awkward gap between the comment text and the 'Show more' button\nSolution: Remove line breaks from the end of the comment when hiding the rest of the comment behind the 'Show more' button\n\nRequest 4: Decrease Gap between profile/upload date line and comment body from 10px to 5px\nSolution: This is straight forward :), just decrease gap from 10px to 5px\n\nRequest 5: Remove the 'Published ... time ago' part of the upload date to save space\nSolution: Already Done :)\n\nRequest 6 (OPTIONAL): The upload date still takes alot of space on mobile\nSolution: Use time short hand in mobile. For example, use '5h ago' instead of '5 hours ago' or '4mo ago' instead of '4 months ago'\n\nRequest 7 (OPTIONAL): The user flag, user name, and upload date are not aligned\nSolution: Align the 3 on the baseline", "Cool, well summarised, it's pretty much spot-on. :)) \n\nThe only thing that got trickier since then is the Request 4. If you run the project locally or are a beta-tester, you will see that now the three-dots menu next to the top-comment has been implemented. The three-dots button is huge however, which makes the whole header of the top-comment taller than the replies and therefore makes it hard to achieve consistent gap.\n\nI don't know however what makes the most sense from the coding best practices - but I imagine if you tackle the Request 2. and include the avatar image in the comment header, then the whole header will get the height of the image. I would then suggest trying to make the image size and the three-dots menu size the same - let's try 35x35px and adjusting the gap accordingly.\n\n<img width=\"747\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be0d2dc1-70f8-41db-b36a-7eda73e85eb2\" />\n\nOther than that we just wait for @benfurber to assign. :))", "I'm sceptical of making the avatar too small, otherwise what's the point of showing it.\n\nIt's yours @JCSergent.\n\nOne thing to note, I'm about to implement some icon changes which includes the pointing down arrow in these screenshots." ],

While I don't have a fix yet, we've previously encountered a very similar issue before (https://github.com/kernelwernel/VMAware/issues/359) and all we've done to fix it was by detecting binary translation environments and blacklisting (if found) for those specific techniques, and I'm pretty sure this is the path we'll take but I need to consult with my co-dev (@NotRequiem) who manages these techniques. I assume he's sleeping at the moment, but I'll let him know about the issue.\n\n> You can see in that all hypervisor registers are all zeroes.\n\nThat technique isn't really relevant in this scenario, it's relatively common to have that output.\n\n> I know that a normal hypervisor will return a bendstring when calling CPUID EAX=0x40000000. However, it is a bit strange to see that it is detected as a VM even though it is all 0.\n\nI assume you meant \"brand string\" instead of bendstring, but this is also not surprising since it's a binary translator. I *assume* you have Microsoft PRISM doing the x86 to ARM translation, which isn't really accurate to call it an emulator in itself but that's besides the point.\n\nA lot of funky stuff happens when the binary is being translated to a different ISA, but we still do our best to keep it as compatible as possible with the same core mechanisms we've done for real x86 hardware.

I propose we switch to following the [XDG Base Directory Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html) because:\n* Standardization: XDG paths are the standard across Linux and many Unix-like environments, improving consistency.\n* Flexibility: Allows users to customize locations via environment variables (XDG_CONFIG_HOME, XDG_DATA_HOME), avoiding clutter in the home directory.\n* Compatibility: Better aligns with modern best practices and other open-source tools.\n* Cross-platform: Provides a clearer way to handle config/data locations on different OSes.\n\n### \uD83D\uDCA1 Why is this needed? What if we don't build it?\n\nConsistency!\n\n### Other thoughts\n\n_No response_",

Write a brief description of how you will approach the task (without using ChatGPT).\n3. Add your Telegram handler in your application (e.g., in OnlyDust or similar)\n4. Write ETA in your application\n\n\n\n## What should I do if I have a problem\n1. Try to google it before asking. Googling is taking major part of dev work \n2. If you couldn't find answer your question with Google, text your question to [dev](https://t.me/spotnet_dev/4) group with your question.\n3. Do not send DM to maintainer, it would be better and faster to ask other contributors in chat \n\n\n## How to prepare PR\n1. Check if your code [smell](https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/smells) good\n2.  Add `close #<issue number>` to link your issue with your PR\n3.  Do not commit changes which is not related to your task \n4. Check after you created PR, if you committed everything.\n\n## Task description  \n1. Create a `POST /signup` endpoint that accepts only the user's email in the request body:\n```json\n{\n  \"email\": \"user@example.com\"\n}\n```\n\n2. Check if the email already exists in the database (e.g. pre-created by a super admin).\n3. If valid, generate a JWT token that encodes the email.\n4. Send a confirmation email with a link in the following format:\n\n```python\nf'{app_base_url}/signup-confirmation?token={token}'\n```\n\n5. Add `app_base_url` to your settings (if it's not already present).\n6. Do not return any sensitive info in the response.\n7. Add appropriate tests to cover:\n\n   * New signup attempt\n   * Already existing email\n   * Proper link generation\n   * Email delivery trigger\n\n**NOTE: This refers to the admin entity**",

I do not know about how to do diff, but surely there has to be a way via nsys cli.\n\nNo sure yet how it is gonna behave with Phoenix, but integrating this into self-hosted `test.yml` is the way.\nAlso, never tested it, but I guess it is possible to profile a run locally using the workflow file with github cli `gh act -P ubuntu-latest=-self-hosted -W .github/workflows/profiling.yml` or by simply installing Nsights then `nsys profile -o report ./mfc.sh test -a --gpu`", "@Malmahrouqi3 thanks, yes you can add it that way, it's a good POC. you actually just pass different commands to the nsys command, `nsys --help` or whatever, and it will give you the information on the command line and you would just dump that into the output of the CI. I'm not sure if a diff is the best way to go or not (presumably that would go into benchmarking since it would have to be PR vs. Master). \n\nThe easiest way to get a merge in, that could possibly be migrated to benchmarking later, would be to just run the nsys command with appropriate flags, and it will tell you what the most expensive subroutines are. We have some documentation on nsight profiling in the MFC docs `./mfc.sh run <...> --profile` should work I think. But I think that will just create a report file you look at in the GUI.

      "description" : "## Guideline\n1. Carefully read the issue description before applying to ensure you have all the necessary information to start working on it.\n2. Write a brief description of how you will approach the task (without using ChatGPT).\n3. Add your Telegram handler in your application (e.g., in OnlyDust or similar)\n4. Write ETA in your application\n\n\n\n## What should I do if I have a problem\n1. Try to google it before asking. Googling is taking major part of dev work \n2. If you couldn't find answer your question with Google, text your question to [dev](https://t.me/spotnet_dev/4) group with your question.\n3. Do not send DM to maintainer, it would be better and faster to ask other contributors in chat \n\n\n## How to prepare PR\n1. Check if your code [smell](https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/smells) good\n2. Add `close #<issue number>` to link your issue with your PR\n3. Do not commit changes that are unrelated to your task\n4. Check after you created PR, if you committed everything\n\n\n## Task Description\n1. In the [handlers folder](./blob/main/margin/margin_app/app/telegram/handlers), create a new file named `admin.py`. Inside, add a handler called `/assets`. Use the [`Admin Filter` from this issue](https://github.com/djeck1432/spotnet/issues/915) to verify the user is an admin. Then, call the [`Assets statistic` method from this issue](https://github.com/djeck1432/spotnet/issues/906) to retrieve the data. Format the response using Telegram Markdown so it displays neatly.\n2. Provide a screenshot demonstrating that the handler works as expected.\n",

It makes sense for DagRun with multiple versions, but I don't think we should be able to explore DagVersions that are not part of the selected dagrun at all. \n\nIt makes it hard to follow when we start playing with the `version selector` when a DagRun is selected. (Is the DagVersion that I have selected part of the DagRun.dag_versions, or am I watching a completely unrelated structure)\n\n\nFor instance in the following image I have the `v2` structure displayed for a DagRun that actually only has `v4` part of his versions. The output graph doesn't make much sense.\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb45d6a5-514f-464e-b756-39c8b0a70c39)\n\n\nI do not know yet what is the best way to address this, any idea is welcome.\n### Committer\n\n- [x] I acknowledge that I am a maintainer/committer of the Apache Airflow project.",

The directory includes artifacts that meet the CR requirements, along with PGP signatures for every file. I'm fairly sure, given the actual error below, that the artifacts themselves don't matter.\n\nI have the following `jreleaser.toml`:\n\n```\n[deploy.maven.mavenCentral.sonatype]\nactive = \"ALWAYS\"\nsign = false\nurl = \"https://central.sonatype.com/api/v1/publisher\"\nstagingRepositories = [\"build/maven\"]\n```\n\nI run jreleaser:\n\n```\n$ env

--config-file=jreleaser.toml\n```\n\n### Expected Behaviour\n\nI'd expect to see `jreleaser` create a bundle and deploy it to Maven Central.\n\n### Actual Behaviour\n\n```\n[INFO]  JReleaser

While it is not explicitly stored in the footer, it can be estimated by analyzing the number of pages via the `OrdinalIndex` and calculating the average page size.  \n\nIt might be worthwhile to include a few functions for inspecting a column's metadata.\n\nFurther more, we can also consider add these column stats into the optimizer statistics system, stored in the `_statistics_.column_statistics` table.\n\n",

Write a brief description of how you will approach the task (without using ChatGPT).\n3. Add your Telegram handler in your application (e.g., in OnlyDust or similar)\n4. Write ETA in your application\n\n\n\n## What should I do if I have a problem\n1. Try to google it before asking. Googling is taking major part of dev work \n2. If you couldn't find answer your question with Google, text your question to [dev](https://t.me/spotnet_dev/4) group with your question.\n3. Do not send DM to maintainer, it would be better and faster to ask other contributors in chat \n\n\n## How to prepare PR\n1. Check if your code [smell](https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/smells) good\n2.  Add `close #<issue number>` to link your issue with your PR\n3.  Do not commit changes which is not related to your task \n4. Check after you created PR, if you committed everything.\n\n\n## Task Description\n1. Implement CRUD methods to retrieve the data shown in the following diagram:\n\n   ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb26457a-78c3-4f47-bdc6-876f4b917848)\n\nIt will be calculated by summing the token amounts across all `user_pools` and multiplying them by their current prices, as defined in [this issue](https://github.com/djeck1432/spotnet/issues/909).\n\n2. Add a new endpoint `/admin/statistic/assets` in the [`admin.py`](https://github.com/djeck1432/spotnet/blob/main/margin/margin_app/app/api/admin.py) file to expose this data.\n3. Write tests for the new endpoint, covering both positive and negative scenarios.\n4. Verify that all CI workflows pass and the endpoint functions correctly.\n",

      "description" : "# Fork, Commit, Merge - Medium Issue 2 (React.js)\r\n\r\n## Create a Traffic Light Component\r\n*Note: You don't have ask permission to start solving the issue or get assigned, since these issues are supposed to be always open for new contributors. The actions-user bot will reset the file back to previous state for the next contributor after your commit is merged. So you can just simply start working with the issue right away!*\r\n\r\n### How to get started:\r\n\r\nStart by navigating inside of the directory used in this project with the command:\r\n```bash\r\ncd tasks/react/medium/traffic-light\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen run `npm i` to install Vite, React and all the necessary dependencies for the project.\r\n\r\nAfter installing the dependencies you can open the `src` directory and the `TrafficLight.tsx` file, and start implementing your solution!\r\n\r\n![react-medium](https://github.com/fork-commit-merge/fork-commit-merge/assets/82566656/e154750d-41fd-4db4-bcc6-9dd52c7e55d6)\r\n\r\n### Description:\r\n\r\nCreate a React component using TypeScript that simulates a traffic light. The component should display three lights (red, yellow, and green) and switch between them automatically in the order of a typical traffic light sequence.\r\n\r\n### Requirements:\r\n\r\n-   Implement a `TrafficLight` component in `src/TrafficLight.tsx`.\r\n-   Use TypeScript for type safety.\r\n-   The component should render three circles, colored red, yellow, and green.\r\n-   The traffic light should start with the red light.\r\n-   After a few seconds, it should change to green, then yellow, and then back to red in a continuous loop.\r\n-   Only one light should be \"active\" (brighter) at a time.\r\n\r\nThere are some CSS classes already added for you in the `src/App.css` file, which you can use if you like, or write your own custom CSS.\r\nThere is for example a helper pseudo-class selector for every light that is not active, which will set the light color to gray if the light does not have the `active` class:\r\n\r\n![react-medium-css](https://github.com/fork-commit-merge/fork-commit-merge/assets/82566656/052aaf61-e4d9-40b9-8876-bf96aa2ada9c)\r\n\r\n### Example:\r\n\r\nThe traffic light should cycle as follows:\r\n\r\n-   Red (active) for 4 seconds.\r\n-   Green (active) for 3 seconds.\r\n-   Yellow (active) for 1 second.\r\n-   Repeat the cycle.\r\n\r\n## How to run:\r\nAfter you are done with the card, make sure you are in the `tasks/react/medium/traffic-light` in your terminal and run `npm run dev` to start the Vite server. Then, open \"http://localhost:5173/\" in your browser to check how the app looks.\r\n\r\nIf it looks to be working fine, you are ready to make a pull request!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo work with this issue, you need to have npm and NodeJS installed to your local machine.\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions of installing npm and NodeJS as well as how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Why use Vite?\r\n\r\nThis React project uses Vite for near-instant server start-ups and incredibly fast hot module replacements, providing a smooth and efficient development experience.\r\nAlso Vite requires minimal setup, allowing us to focus on writing React code without getting bogged down in complex configurations.\r\nIf you want to learn more about Vite, check out the documentation:\r\n[Vite Official Documentation](https://vitejs.dev/)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

Often, these lists will be short (<5 arguments), but there is no guarantee that the JVM will unroll their loops automatically.\n\nFunctions that perform relatively simple operations may benefit from manually unrolled variants that skip loop and conditional checks, and instead have a straight bytecode path for the calculations.\n\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\n\nReview var-args functions, particularly those with numeric arguments and basic calculations. If they are a candidate for loop unrolling, implement and benchmark to prove it is faster.\n\nExamples of var-args functions:\n\n- greatest/least\n- IN\n- CASE\n- coalesce\n- ~l2price~\n- concat\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Full Name:\n\nNick Woolmer\n\n### Affiliation:\n\nQuestDB\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

      "repositoryName" : "dotnet/aspnetcore",
      "description" : "## Summary\n\nAdd a ```blob([mimeType: string])``` method to ```DotNetStreamReference``` in Blazor, allowing developers to obtain a Blob from a .NET stream in JavaScript, without fully loading the stream into memory. We chose this specific issue, because it is a \"good-first-issue\" and we are participating in a germany wide competition, where the subject is to work on issues in open source projects. \nLink to issue: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/47685\n\n## Motivation and goals\n\nBlazor developers can currently pass .NET streams to JavaScript using ```DotNetStreamReference```, which exposes two main methods:\n- ```stream()``` (returns a ReadableStream)\n- ```arrayBuffer()``` (loads the full stream into memory)\n\nThe problem:\n- There is no direct way to obtain a Blob, which is required for many web APIs (like ```<video>``` elements, file downloads or drag-and-drop functionality).\n- ```arrayBuffer()``` is not suitable for large files (like videos) because it fully buffers the stream in memory before use.\n- Using ```stream()``` gives a ReadableStream, but many APIs (like ```<video src=...>```, ```URL.createObjectURL()```) require a Blob, not a stream, and converting a ReadableStream into a Blob in JS is non-trivial and inefficient.\n\nAdding a ```blob()``` method would:\n- Allow efficient handling of large files (like video or audio) without consuming excessive memory.\n- Simplify developer workflows by aligning with common web APIs that expect a Blob.\n- Close a usability gap in the current Blazor-JS interop system.\n\n## In scope\n\n- A new method ```blob([mimeType: string])``` on ```DotNetStreamReference``` that returns a Blob representing the .NET stream.\n- Ensuring the Blob can be used with standard web APIs (e.g., ```<video>```, ```<audio>```, ```URL.createObjectURL()```).\n- Keeping performance and memory usage efficient for large streams.\n\n## Out of scope\n\n- Changes to the existing stream() or arrayBuffer() methods.\n- Polyfills for browsers that lack Blob support (modern browsers are assumed).\n- Enhancements to streaming APIs beyond providing the Blob.\n\n## Risks / unknowns\n- **Browser behavior**: While Blobs are widely supported, the implementation detail of\nstreaming data into a Blob without full buffering might depend on browser internals.\nSome browsers may still buffer the entire Blob in memory before making it available.\n\n- **Memory use**: Even if we avoid buffering in .NET or JS, the underlying browser may still\nend up consuming memory when the Blob is accessed, especially for very large files.\n\n- **Implementation complexity**: Creating a Blob from a .NET stream across JS interop\nmight require platform-level work to ensure true streaming behavior rather than just\nbuffering and converting.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Blazor usage example\n```blazor\n<video @ref=\"videoPlayer\" controls autoplay></video>\n\n<button @onclick=\"PlayVideo\">Play Streamed Video</button>\n\n@code {\n    private ElementReference videoPlayer;\n\n    private async Task PlayVideo()\n    {\n        using var fileStream = File.OpenRead(\"bigvideo.mp4\");\n        var streamRef = new DotNetStreamReference(fileStream);\n\n        // JS call to create a blob URL from the .NET stream\n        var videoUrl = await JS.InvokeAsync<string>(\"createVideoBlobUrl\", streamRef);\n\n        // Set the video source\n        await JS.InvokeVoidAsync(\"setVideoSrc\", videoPlayer, videoUrl);\n    }\n}\n```\n### JavaScript interop\n```JavaScript\nwindow.createVideoBlobUrl = async function (streamRef) {\n    const blob = await streamRef.blob(\"video/mp4\");\n    return URL.createObjectURL(blob);\n};\n\nwindow.setVideoSrc = function (videoElement, src) {\n    videoElement.src = src;\n};\n```\n",

We weren’t able to find a viable approach within a Node.js test environment.\n\nAs a result, we’ve verified the method manually in real browsers using various input streams and confirmed that it behaves as expected.

It is also extremely useful for testing, tbh, but also some potential future privacy/security concerns.

      "description" : "# Background\nHi community,\n\nShardingSphere's parser engine enables users to parse SQL into AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) and convert it into SQLStatement objects. \nThis issue focuses on enhancing MySQL stored procedure parsing capabilities to support complex database programming logic.\n\nMore details:\nhttps://shardingsphere.apache.org/document/current/en/reference/sharding/parse/\n\n# Issue Background Explanation\n\nThese SQL statements are from the official MySQL test set. \nYou can find the corresponding stored procedure SQL statements in the following website: https://github.com/mysql/mysql-server/tree/8.0/mysql-test/t \nThese SQL cases are then passed to ShardingSphere's parsing engine for analysis. \nFor SQL cases that fail to be parsed successfully, every 3 to 5 SQL cases are grouped together as an issue.\n1. It cannot be guaranteed that all SQL cases are correct. Please follow the following process to handle this pull request (PR).\n2. Some SQL cases may have already been fixed in other PRs. For cases that can already be executed successfully, simply leave a comment to ignore them.\n3. If a SQL case can be executed successfully without any code changes, there is no need to add a corresponding test assert file.\n\n# Task\nThis issue requires adding support for the following MySQL stored procedure syntax:\n```sql\n-- The original file and line number of the sql: analyze:85 \nCREATE PROCEDURE p() ANALYZE TABLE v UPDATE HISTOGRAM ON w\n```\n\n```sql\n-- The original file and line number of the sql: change_user_deadlock:35 \nEND |\nCREATE PROCEDURE p_processlist()\nBEGIN\nDECLARE x INT DEFAULT 3000\n```\n\n```sql\n-- The original file and line number of the sql: change_user_deadlock:26 \nCREATE PROCEDURE p_flush_status()\nBEGIN\nDECLARE x INT DEFAULT 3000\n```\n\n```sql\n-- The original file and line number of the sql: clear_diag_area:254 \nCREATE PROCEDURE p7_show_warnings ()\nBEGIN\nSHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'foo';\nSHOW WARNINGS;\nSELECT \"(SHOW WARNINGS does not have to come last)\";\nEND\n```\n\n```sql\n-- The original file and line number of the sql: clear_diag_area:263 \nCREATE PROCEDURE p8b_show_warnings ()\nBEGIN\nSHOW WARNINGS;\nEND\n```\n\n\n# Overall Procedure\nIf you intend to participate in fixing this issue, please feel free to leave a comment below the issue. Community members will assign the issue accordingly.\nFor example, you can leave a comment like this: \"Hi, please assign this issue to me. Thank you!\"\n\nOnce you have claimed the issue, please review the syntax of the SQL on the official website of the corresponding database. \nExecute the SQL on the respective database to ensure the correctness of the SQL syntax.\n\nYou can check the corresponding source of each SQL case on the official database website.\nNext, execute the problematic SQL cases mentioned above in the database (you can quickly start the corresponding database using the Docker image for that database, and then connect to it using a client you are  familiar with), to ensure that the SQL syntax itself is correct.\n\n\nOnce you have confirmed the correctness of the SQL syntax, you can validate and fix the grammar parsing issue in ShardingSphere.\n>If you are using IntelliJ IDEA, you will need to install the ANTLR plugin before proceeding.\nIf it is an ANTLR parsing error message, try to repair the `.g4` file by comparing it with the official database syntax until the SQL can be correctly parsed by ANTLR.\nWhen there is no error message in the ANTLR Preview window, it means that ANTLR can correctly parse the SQL.\n\n\nAfter ANTLR parses SQL into an abstract syntax tree, ShardingSphere will access the abstract syntax tree through Visitor and extract the required information.\nIf you need to extract Segments, you need to first execute:\n```shell\nmvn -T 2C clean install -DskipTests\n```\nUnder the shardingsphere-parser module to compile the entire parser module.\nThen rewrite the corresponding visit method in SQLStatementVisitorr as needed to extract the corresponding Segment.\n\n\nAfter the above SQL parsing problem is repaired, the corresponding Test needs to be added.\nThe steps are as follows:\n1. Add the corresponding `sql-case` in the `sql/supported` directory.\n2. Add case assertions in the case directory of the `shardingsphere-test-it-parser` module.\n3. Run `org.apache.shardingsphere.test.it.sql.parser.internal.InternalSQLParserIT`\nAfter SQL Parser IT runs successfully, you can submit a PR.\n\n\n1. Master JAVA language\n2. Have a basic understanding of Antlr g4 file\n3. Be familiar with MySQL SQLs",

This will help you learn the basics of reading and updating signals in Solid.js.\n\n---\n***Note: You don't have ask permission to start solving the issue or get assigned, since these issues are supposed to be always open for new contributors. The actions-user bot will reset the file back to previous state for the next contributor after your commit is merged. So you can just simply start working with the issue right away!***\n\nIssue created by ***![zshaian](https://github.com/zshaian)***.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nYou can start by navigating to the folder `./task/solid/easy`\n\nOnce you are on that folder you can then install the packages that you are going to need to run Solid.js framework, you can do so by running `npm i`\n\nAfter installing the dependencies you can open the src directory and App.jsx file, and start implementing your solution!\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/682663cd-4af6-4c69-b3f7-4e8e41bfb798)\n\n**All the CSS classes needed in this project has already been done for you in index.css and app.module.css.**\n\n## Requiremets:\n\n- Implement the counter state with the name of \"count\" and a setter named \"setCount\"\n- Display the current count\n- Increment or Decrement the count state using the \"setCount\"\n\nIf you can display the current count and increment or decrement it based on the buttons, you are ready to make a pull request.\n\n---\nTo work with this issue, you need to have npm and NodeJS installed to your local machine.\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/fork-commit-merge/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions of installing npm and NodeJS as well as how to make a pull request.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\n\n**Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!**",

The actions-user bot will reset the file back to previous state for the next contributor after your commit is merged. So you can just simply start working with the issue right away!*\r\n\r\n## How to get started\r\n\r\nStart by opening the `tasks/python/medium` directory from the root of the project. \r\nThen open `bubble_sort.py` file and start working on your solution!\r\n\r\n![python-medium](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/assets/82566656/b32978ed-2a26-48d8-9bd4-322cf1916586)\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThe goal of this issue is to implement the bubble sort algorithm in Python. The function should be able to sort an array of integers in ascending order. You should create a function called `bubble_sort` to accomplish this.\r\n*Note: Do not use the `sort` function or any similar methods to solve this task.*\r\n\r\n## How to run\r\n\r\nMake sure you are in the right directory:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncd tasks/python/medium\r\n```\r\n\r\nExecute the following command to run your Python script:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npython bubble_sort.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected output\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nOriginal array: [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]\r\nSorted array: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the output looks correct, you are ready to make a pull request!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo work with this issue, you need to have Python installed to your local machine.\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions of installing Python and how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

Execute a Bitwarden CLI command (example: 'bw list items')\n\n### Expected Result\n\nThe Bitwarden CLI should respect the `no_proxy` variable and don't use the proxy.\n\n### Actual Result\n\nThe Bitwarden CLI will try to send a post request to the Bitwarden server using the proxy.\n\n### Screenshots or Videos\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional Context\n\nThis behavior was observed on Linux. I can't state if the behavior on other OSes is comparable.\n\n### Operating System\n\nLinux\n\n### Operating System Version\n\nUbuntu 24.04.2 LTS\n\n### Shell\n\nBash\n\n### Build Version\n\n2025.1.3\n\n### Issue Tracking Info\n\n- [x] I understand that work is tracked outside of Github.

We've added this to our internal tracking system.\nID: PM-19047", "Hi @frq-asgard-josi and thank you for your report.\n\nBitwarden uses [https-proxy-agent](https://www.npmjs.com/package/https-proxy-agent) to handle proxied connections on the CLI. This is either an upstream issue or we might need to switch over to using [proxy-agent](https://www.npmjs.com/package/proxy-agent) from the same maintainer, which proxies \uD83D\uDE02 calls based on the set env-variables.\n\nMid/Long-term, Bitwarden CLI will likely benefit moving over to using native NodeJS fetch support and proxy via [undici](https://github.com/nodejs/undici). I looked into this a while ago, but it hasn't been a priority to migrate.\n\nMarking this as good first issue, in case anyone would like to start investigating.\n\nKind regards,\nDaniel", "@djsmith85 @frq-asgard-josi\n\nI did some digging, and here's my theory.\n\n[proxy-agent](https://github.com/TooTallNate/proxy-agents/blob/main/packages/proxy-agent) depends on [proxy-from-env](https://github.com/Rob--W/proxy-from-env) to process proxy-related environment variables.\n\nThe [logic](https://github.com/Rob--W/proxy-from-env/blob/master/index.js#L64) in `proxy-from-env` for interpreting `NO_PROXY` may be the root cause.\n\n```js\nfunction shouldProxy(hostname, port) {\n  var NO_PROXY =\n    (getEnv('npm_config_no_proxy') || getEnv('no_proxy')).toLowerCase();\n  if (!NO_PROXY) {\n    return true;  // Always proxy if NO_PROXY is not set.\n  }\n  if (NO_PROXY === '*') {\n    return false;  // Never proxy if wildcard is set.\n  }\n}\nfunction getEnv(key) {\n  return process.env[key.toLowerCase()] || process.env[key.toUpperCase()] || '';\n}\n```\n\n`npm_config_no_proxy` has higher priority, and if set, `no_proxy` or `NO_PROXY` won't be effective. This [issue](https://github.com/Rob--W/proxy-from-env/issues/13) and [fix](https://github.com/Rob--W/proxy-from-env/pull/27) are still open.\n" ],

These JSON artifacts are regenerated when required and added to the repository, for example, in the [./GeneralStateTests/ sub-directory](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/tree/develop/GeneralStateTests).\r\n\r\nFrom [Shanghai](https://ethereum.org/en/history/#shapella) on, new test cases (in particular for new features included in hard-forks) have been defined in Python in this repository (execution-spec-tests). The existing test cases are still important to execute against clients, however, and porting ethereum/tests to execution-spec-tests ensures that the test cases can be continually maintained and filled (generated) for newer forks. It also has the advantage that client teams will only need to obtain test fixture releases from one source.\r\n\r\n#### Automated Port to Python\r\nAlthough there will be an effort to automate (\"transpile\") the remaining test cases from YAML (respectively JSON) to Python; contributions to manually port individual test cases can be very beneficial and are welcome! \r\n\r\nThe benefits of manual porting are:\r\n1. Reduce the number of test cases by combing multiple YAML (resp. JSON) test cases in one Python test function (via parametrization).\r\n2. Potentially improve coverage by parametrizing the Python version.\r\n3. Code/docstrings are likely higher quality than an automated conversion.\r\n4. The test can be better [organized within the `./tests` folder](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-spec-tests/main/writing_tests/adding_a_new_test/) in execution-spec-tests by the fork and the EIP in which the functionality was introduced.\r\n\r\n#### Process\r\n1. Pick a single or a set of YAML test cases in ethereum/tests to port and create an issue in this repository - optional, but definitely recommended if porting tests from the tracker below to avoid duplicate work.\r\n2. Create a PR with the ported tests:\r\n    a. Add the list of ported YAML files to [converted-ethereum-tests.txt](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/blob/1b30c336eae6b0746ea4db441ac74406f2fb2322/converted-ethereum-tests.txt).\r\n    b. If the tests can't currently be filled, please explain the issue (feel free to also [open a Discussion](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/discussions/new?category=general)).\r\n\r\n#### Help with ethereum/tests\r\n\r\nThe test formats are described in the [ethereum/tests online docs](https://ethereum-tests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/blockchain-ref.html). Note that state filler test cases in YAML can be parametrized, see the [docs here](https://ethereum-tests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/test_filler/state_filler.html#the-indexes).\r\n\r\n#### Hints to Get Started with ethereum/execution-spec-tests\r\n\r\n0. Start here: [Getting Started → Installation](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-spec-tests/main/getting_started/installation/).\r\n1. Use `uv run et make test` to create a template test module (currently a WIP in #950).\r\n2. Where to put the test? See how tests are organized in [Writing Tests → Adding a New Test](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-spec-tests/main/writing_tests/adding_a_new_test/).\r\n3. State vs Blockchain test? If in doubt try to write a state test, see [Writing Tests → Types of Tests → Deciding on a Test Type](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-spec-tests/main/writing_tests/types_of_tests/#deciding-on-a-test-type).\r\n4. Tests are filled via EELS by default (no further installation necessary; it's a Python dependency and got installed in Step 0), see [Filling  → Getting Started](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-spec-tests/main/filling_tests/getting_started/).\r\n5. Parametrizing test functions is encouraged, see [Writing Tests → Writing a New Test → Parametrizing Tests](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-spec-tests/main/writing_tests/writing_a_new_test/#parametrizing-tests).\r\n6. The Opcode mini-lang defined in this repository is the preferred way to define bytecode in tests (if feasible). For a very simple example, see [`test_chainid()`](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/blob/85393456e75f5f3b476cb5e61c35d48172f9d543/tests/istanbul/eip1344_chainid/test_chainid.py#L28) - there are other examples in the tests.\r\n\r\nFeel free to reach out for help or guidance in the Ethereum R&D discord or via DM; see [Getting Help](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-spec-tests/main/getting_started/getting_help/) in the docs.\r\n\r\n```[tasklist]\r\n### Test Cases\r\n- [ ] Add test cases for any single opcode (porting an entire test case from ethereum/tests can be overwhelming;

The User Stories should follow this pattern:-->\r\nAs a app user I want know if at a poi my language is spoken so that I know if it is worth for me to go there.\r\n\r\n### Additional Context\r\n<!-- Add any other information or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\r\nSee: https://openproject.tuerantuer.org/projects/community-feedback/work_packages/3231/activity\r\n\r\n### Design Requirements\r\n<!-- If the customization includes input from our design team, the detailed requirements will be collected here.

      "description" : "**Describe the bug**\n\n\n**To Reproduce**\n\n1. Checkout and build [Camunda Example Twitter](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/camunda-8-examples/tree/main/twitter-review-java-springboot)\n\n2. Set appropriate configuration properties to connect to your cluster/instance\n```\nzeebe.client.cloud.clusterId=...\nzeebe.client.cloud.clientId=SJqG7ve....\nzeebe.client.cloud.clientSecret=...\nzeebe.client.cloud.region=...\nzeebe.client.cloud.auth-url=...\nzeebe.client.cloud.base-url=...\n```\n\n3. Set environment variable \n```\nZEEBE_CLIENT_CONFIG_PATH=/tmp\n```\n\n4. Run the application and see some errors on the console regarding authentication issues.\n\n```\nat io.camunda.zeebe.client.impl.ZeebeClientFutureImpl.join(ZeebeClientFutureImpl.java:52) ~[zeebe-client-java-8.6.7.jar:8.6.7]\n\t... 32 common frames omitted\nCaused by: io.grpc.StatusRuntimeException: UNAUTHENTICATED: HTTP status code 401\ninvalid content-type: text/html\nheaders: Metadata(:status=401,date=Fri, 24 Jan 2025 14:49:06 GMT,content-type=text/html,www-authenticate=Bearer token_type=\"JWT\",strict-transport-security=max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains,content-length=172)\nDATA-----------------------------\n<html>\n<head><title>401 Authorization Required</title></head>\n<body>\n<center><h1>401 Authorization Required</h1></center>\n<hr><center>nginx</center>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n**Expected behavior**\n\nFor a better developer experience, the client should at least log an error to the console. But ideally should abort the bootstrapping with a useful error message mentioning which property is wrongly configured.\n\n**Log/Stacktrace**\n\n\n\uD83D\uDC40 \n**We do indeed raise an exception, when a directory is configured instead of a file (see [here](https://github.com/camunda/camunda/blob/ed8a807969f040fdb55b575a9e31fef957fd8d5e/clients/java/src/main/java/io/camunda/zeebe/client/impl/oauth/OAuthCredentialsProviderBuilder.java#L251)) and\nthe exception bubbles up to `PropertyUtil.java` (see [here](https://github.com/camunda/camunda/blob/cbef3b18134bbd4198456c293206bef2eab726f9/clients/spring-boot-starter-camunda-sdk/src/main/java/io/camunda/zeebe/spring/client/configuration/PropertyUtil.java#L98)) where the error is logged with `DEBUG` level!**\n\uD83D\uDC40 \n\nThus in order to see the message on the console the log level of the spring application needs to be changed\n(You will still see a lot of noise on the log, because the client still continues to bootstrap)\n\n```\nlogging.level.root=DEBUG\n```\n\nSee stack trace and error message below.\n\n<details><summary>Full Stacktrace</summary>\n

It would be a great idea to formalise this as a trait. By doing so:\n- We can reference this method without the compiler needing to know what type it is\n- We can ensure that this behaviour is guaranteed across vector stores.\n\nThis would also be a good chance to implement a new, different type of `insert_docs` method that also takes a user-defined ID generation strategy (although perhaps out of initial scope for the first PR).\n\n### Motivation\n<!--\nPlease describe the use case(s) or other motivation for the new feature.\n-->\nBetter UX, better type reusability.\n\n### Proposal\n<!--\nHow should the new feature be implemented, and why? Add any considered\ndrawbacks.\n-->\nMove all `insert_document` methods under a new `InsertDocuments` trait.\n\n### Alternatives\n<!--\nAre there other ways to solve this problem that you've considered? What are\ntheir potential drawbacks? Why was the proposed solution chosen over these\nalternatives?\n-->\n",

This can result in a token length that exceeds the limits set by the system. Here are some steps you can take to address this issue:您在使用 Dify 中的 Volcengine 插件时遇到的 \"标记太长 \"错误可能与处理大数据输入（如转换为 base64 编码的图像）有关。这可能导致标记长度超出系统设置的限制。以下是解决此问题的一些步骤：\n> \n> 1. **Reduce Image Size**: Try reducing the size of the images before uploading them to Dify. This can help prevent the base64 encoded data from exceeding the token limit.**减小图片大小 **：在将图片上传到 Dify 之前，请尝试减小图片大小。这有助于防止 base64 编码数据超出令牌限制。\n> 2. **Check Token Limits**: Ensure that the token limits for your model and API requests are configured correctly. Dify imposes a generation length limit of 2k tokens for reasoning models, which might be relevant if your workflow involves such models [[1]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/17120).**检查令牌限制 **：确保正确配置模型和 API 请求的令牌限制。Dify 为推理模型规定了 2k 标记的生成长度限制，如果您的工作流涉及此类模型，则可能与此相关 [[1]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/17120) 。\n> 3. **Switch Model Provider**: If you're using the `openai_api_compatible` provider, consider switching to a different model provider that might handle larger token sizes more effectively [[2]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/18657).**切换模型提供程序 **：如果您正在使用 `openai_api_compatible` 提供程序，请考虑切换到不同的模型提供程序，这样可以更有效地处理更大的标记大小 [[2]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/18657) 。\n> 4. **Review Workflow Configuration**: Double-check your workflow configuration to ensure that all parameters and settings are optimized for handling the data sizes you're working with.**审查工作流程配置 **：仔细检查您的工作流程配置，确保所有参数和设置都经过优化，以处理您正在处理的数据大小。\n> \n> By implementing these suggestions, you should be able to mitigate the \"token too long\" error and improve the stability of your plugin operations.通过实施这些建议，您应该可以减少 \"标记太长 \"错误，并提高插件运行的稳定性。\n> \n> _To continue talking to [Dosu](https://dosu.dev), mention [@dosu](https://github.com/dosu).要继续与 [Dosu](https://dosu.dev) 通话，请提及 。_\n> \n> Help Dosu learn!

      "description" : "# \uD83C\uDF1F Open Call for Contributions: Gemma 3n Recipes \uD83D\uDC8E\n\nHello community! \uD83D\uDC4B\n\nWe got really excited last week with the full release of [Gemma 3n](https://huggingface.co/blog/gemma3n) \uD83D\uDC8E by Google DeepMind. With that, we’d like to open this call for contributions to explore the amazing recipes the community can build with it!\n\nThis project follows the same principles as our previous [Hugging Face Llama Recipes](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface-llama-recipes), which you might also want to check out. You can refer to that repository to see the previous [call for contributions](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface-llama-recipes/issues/43) and discover what the community created. You may also want to browse the [Gemma Cookbook](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemma-cookbook) for further inspiration.\n\n> Star the project to boost it! :star:\n\n## \uD83D\uDCA1 What You Could Build\n\nGemma 3n is specifically designed for low-resource (on-device) environments and is a **multimodal model** that supports text, image, video, and audio inputs — so we’d love to see projects where those capabilities shine! ✨ We highly recommend checking out the [blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/gemma3n) to better understand the possibilities and spark your creativity.\n\nYou could:\n- Showcase agentic or interactive uses of the model\n- Build recipes using `transformers`, `llama.cpp`, or `transformers.js`\n- Create fine-tuning notebooks for domain-specific tasks using any of the supported modalities\n- Or anything else that pushes the boundaries of on-device and multimodal AI! \uD83E\uDD16\n\nHave your own idea?\uD83D\uDCA1 Even better, we’d love to hear it!\n\n## \uD83D\uDCDD How to Contribute\n\n1. **Open a New Issue**\n   - If you’re interested in contributing, please [open a new issue](#) with a descriptive title.\n   - Use the issue to outline your idea and gather early feedback.\n\n2. **Let Us Know**\n   - Comment on this post to let us know you’ve opened a new issue. We’ll update the main list with a link to your idea.\n\n3. **Start Building**\n   - Once you’ve shaped your plan, go ahead and implement your idea \uD83D\uDC68‍\uD83D\uDCBB.\n\n4. **Submit a Pull Request**\n   - When you’re ready, open a Pull Request (PR) that links back to your issue.\n   - Mention the issue in your PR description so it's easy to track.\n\n5. **Update the README**\n   - Don’t forget to add a short description of your contribution to the `README.md`, so others can find and reuse it easily.\n\n## \uD83D\uDCAC For New Contributors\n\nIf you’re just starting out in open source, we recommend reading our [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface-gemma-recipes/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md). It includes helpful tips to get you up and running.\n\nWe can’t wait to see what we’ll build together! \uD83E\uDD20\n",

      "comments" : [ "While refactoring the `test_operator_evaluation` function (`/linalg/tests/test_linalg.py`) to remove all `.toarray() `(to better leverage PSYDAC’s native vector/matrix structures and improve efficiency), I noticed that the current computation of the variable `error_est` relies on a full dense inverse via:\n\n```\nBmat = B.toarray()\n\nB_inv_mat = np.linalg.inv(Bmat)\nb_inv_arr = np.matrix.flatten(B_inv_mat)\nerror_est = 2 + n1 * n2 * np.max([np.abs(b_inv_arr[i]) for i in range(len(b_inv_arr))])\n\n```\nSince we’re avoiding those dense NumPy operations for performance and memory reasons, I believe this calculation of `error_est` no longer fits well in the new context. Computing the full inverse matrix is computationally expensive and somewhat contradictory to the iterative sparse methods we’re testing.\n\nCould you suggest an alternative approach for `error_est`?\nFor example, I’m considering replacing it with a simpler, lightweight estimate such as:\n\n`error_est = {some num > 0}* n1 * n2`\n", "This is an error estimate based on the maximum absolute value of the inverse matrix. It could read in fact\n```python\nerror_est = np.linalg.norm(Bmat.flat, np.inf)\n```\nwhich is the inf-norm of the vectorized matrix. This does not seem to give a sharp estimate, given that it is multiplied by a small number just below (`tol = 1e-5`). Maybe @jowezarek could shed some light on this?", "@anushkasinghh @yguclu \nThanks for bringing this up, this code snipped is ridiculously complicated and doesn't do what it's supposed to do :')\n\nThe explicit matrix inverse was never truly needed, and yet there's no time to gain as the entire test ran in < 3 seconds on my machine.\n\nThis particular part of the test was designed to test whether power operations (**0, **1, **2) work with inverse linear operators (ILOs).\n\nThe poorly executed idea of the test was the following:\n```python\n# arbitrary tolerance\ntol = \n\n# Define 2-norm of vector using inner (as proposed by Yaman)\nnorm2 = lambda v: sqrt(v.inner(v))\n\n# Psydac objects, solver with tolerance = tol\nu\nB_ILO = inverse(B, 'cg', tol=tol)\n\n# First test: Check whether B_ILO**0 is the identity matrix (B_ILO**0 = id?)\n\nerror = (B_ILO**0) @ u - u\nassert norm2(error) < 1e-15 # error should really be zero\n\n# Second test: Check whether B_ILO**1 really computes the inverse up to accuracy (B_ILO**1 = B_ILO?)\n# I.e., we expect B @ B_ILO**1 @ u to be equal to u + err, err a vector of norm less than tol\n\nerror = B @ B_ILO**1 @ u - u\nassert norm2(error) < tol\n\n# Third test: Now checking whether B_ILO**2 is really equal to a double application of B_ILO (B_ILO**2 = B_ILO @ B_ILO?)\n# B @ B @ B_ILO @ B_ILO @ u = B @ ( B_ILO @ u + err1 ) = u + err2 + B @ err1\n# where both err1 and err2 are vectors of norm less than tol, hence\n# | B @ B @ B_ILO @ B_ILO @ u - u | = | err2 + B @ err1 | < | err2 | + | B @ err1 | < tol + |B|_{inf} * tol = (1 + |B|_{inf}) * tol\n\nadjusted_tol = ( 1 + np.max(np.abs(B.toarray())) ) * tol\nerror = B @ B @ B_ILO**2 @ u - u\nassert norm2(error) < adjusted_tol" ],

Especially when you have a long list of layers, its quite tedious to move the mouse cursor down without leaving the hover state. A transition or transition-delay would help, however I have been unable to implement this with pure css. \n\nI have found a workaround by triggering the collapse manually, however its causes other issues, like re-entering while not clearing older timeouts. Probably needs a debounce fn.\nhttps://plnkr.co/edit/WQyfFctUqs7mNdq9\n\nOn another note, a collapseDelay option would work really well to make it customizable.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nLayer control stays for 1-2 seconds after leaving hover state.\n\n### Current behavior\n\nLayer control disappears instantly after leaving hover state\n\n### Minimal example reproducing the issue\n\n_No response_\n\n### Environment\n\n- Leaflet version: 1.9.3\n- Browser (with version): Chrome\n- OS/Platform (with version): Mac/Windows latest\n",

      "description" : "## \uD83E\uDDF1 Devcontainer Setup for Unified Development Environment\n\n### \uD83C\uDFAF Goal\n\nProvide a consistent development environment via Devcontainers to reduce onboarding friction and tooling issues across contributors. This image will be used by all SCORE-related repositories (dozens in total), so it must be robust, reusable, and actively maintained.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Current Situation\n\nWe currently require a number of tools to be installed in addition to Bazel. This includes Python, Graphviz, Bazelisk, and shell autocompletion for Bazel. These tools are not always easy to install correctly across different systems, especially for new contributors.\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDE80 Solution\n\nImplement a reusable Devcontainer setup based on a Docker image that includes all required tools preinstalled. The image should be published to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) and referenced via `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` or `.devcontainer.json` in consuming repositories.\n\n**Target image name:** `ghcr.io/eclipse-score/devcontainer`\n\nThe base image should include:\n\n- Based on an extended Ubuntu image, quite certainly:\n  - `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/python:1.2-3.12`\n- Preinstalled tools:\n  - Python (needed for Bazel formatting bug workaround)\n  - Graphviz\n  - Bazelisk (with current bazel version pre-downloaded)\n  - Shell autocompletion for Bazel\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDEE0️ Concrete Tasks\n\n- [ ] Create a new GitHub repository (name: `eclipse-score/devcontainer`)\n- [ ] Create a `Dockerfile` that installs all required tools\n- [ ] Add GitHub Actions workflow to:\n  - Build the image\n  - Optional: Tag it with semantic version (e.g. `v1.0.0`) and `latest`\n  - Push to GHCR under `ghcr.io/eclipse-score/devcontainer`\n- [ ] Optional: Add typical metadata to the container\n- [ ] Use the image from GHCR in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` or `.devcontainer.json` in at least one repo (e.g. `score`)\n- [ ] Verify that all tools are functional inside the container\n- [ ] Optional: Add documentation (`README.md`) to `eclipse-score/devcontainer`\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDD04 Considered Alternatives\n\nSome tools could theoretically be installed via Bazel, but this was previously evaluated and rejected due to high implementation and maintenance cost. We chose to use system-level tools with clear documentation instead.\n\n---\n\n### \uD83E\uDDE0 Notes\n\n- The image will become the base for all development work across the SCORE ecosystem\n- Keep it generic, stable, and easy to extend.\n- This devcontainer will remain entirely optional, it's just meant to ease the pain of installing all the required tools.\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDCDA References\n\n- Example: [`eclipse-score/score/.devcontainer`](https://github.com/eclipse-score/score/tree/main/.devcontainer)\n- Docs: [Development Environment Setup](https://eclipse-score.github.io/score/main/contribute/development/development_environment.html#autocompletion-in-the-shell)\n",

However, that one is based on Debian instead of Ubuntu. A few of the tools have packages which are created for specific Ubuntu releases only.

Forked and cloned the repository, then searched the codebase for `readline` usage to find the core input handling logic.\n2.  Identified `useKeypress.ts` (for raw keypress events) and `InputPrompt.tsx` (for input logic) as the key files.\n3.  To see what the application receives, I temporarily modified the code to log every keypress event to a `debug.log` file.\n4.  **Key Finding:** My initial debugging proved that on a default macOS Terminal, `Shift+Enter` sends the exact same sequence (`\\r`) as a regular `Enter` press, making the two indistinguishable.\n\n### Attempted Fix & The Final Discovery\n\nBased on the initial finding, I attempted a code-only fix by teaching the application to listen for a different key combination, `Shift+Down`, which often sends a unique sequence on other terminals.\n\n1. The Code I Tested\nI modified `useKeypress.ts` to listen for the `Shift+Down` sequence (`\\x1b[1;2B`) and `InputPrompt.tsx` to handle a `key.shift` flag.\n\n```typescript\n// In useKeypress.ts, I added a check:\nif (key.sequence === '\\x1b[1;2B') {\n  key.name = 'return';\n  key.shift = true;\n}\n```\n```typescript\n// In InputPrompt.tsx, I added the key.shift check:\nif (key.ctrl || key.meta || key.shift || charBefore === '\\\\' || key.paste) {\n  // ... newline logic\n}\n```\n\n2. The Result: It Also Failed\nThis proof-of-concept did not work. To understand why, I used the `cat` command to see what my terminal was actually sending when I pressed `Shift+Down`.\nFinal Proof: The terminal sent `^[[B`, which is the standard escape code for a plain Cursor Down key.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis investigation leads to a definitive conclusion: the default macOS Terminal is more limited than anticipated. It appears to strip the `Shift` modifier information from both the `Enter` key and the arrow keys, making a code-only fix for a `Shift+Key` newline combination unfeasible on this specific platform, although i think this might work on other platforms which by default register shift + down as '\\x1b[1;2B' but i cant really test it.\n\nThis might explain why `Ctrl+J` is a common suggested alternative, as it sends a universal newline character (`\\n`) that doesn't rely on modifier key parsing.\n\nAs this is my first contribution, my analysis could be wrong, and I apologize for the detailed-but-failed attempt. Given these findings, what is the desired path forward? Any information from the internal `b.corp.google.com` link about how other terminals are supported would still be very helpful.\n\nThank you for your time and guidance.", "Just to add, I personally use the Warp Terminal on Mac.

Support basic entity types: PERSON, ORGANIZATION, LOCATION, DATE, EMAIL, PHONE\n2. Support keyword extraction using TF-IDF or similar algorithms\n3. Make this an optional feature with its own dependency group\n4. Results should include entity type, text, and position information\n5. Support custom entity patterns via regex\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n- Add optional dependency group:\n  ```toml\n  optional-dependencies.entity-extraction = [\n    \"gliner>=0.2.0\",  # State-of-the-art zero-shot NER, outperforms spaCy\n    \"keybert>=0.8.0\",  # Most accurate keyword extraction\n  ]\n  ```\n- **Library Choice Rationale**: \n  - Use GLiNER for NER based on 2024 benchmarks showing superior zero-shot performance and flexibility compared to spaCy\n  - Use KeyBERT for keyword extraction as it provides the highest accuracy among RAKE, YAKE, and KeyBERT\n- Add to `ExtractionConfig`:\n  ```python\n  extract_entities: bool = False\n  extract_keywords: bool = False\n  keyword_count: int = 10\n  custom_entity_patterns: dict[str, str] | None = None  # {\"INVOICE_ID\": r\"INV-\\d+\"}\n  ```\n- Add to `ExtractionResult`:\n  ```python\n  entities: list[Entity] | None = None\n  keywords: list[tuple[str, float]] | None = None  # (keyword, score)\n  ```\n- Create `kreuzberg/_entity_extraction.py` module\n- Define `Entity` dataclass with `type`, `text`, `start`, `end` fields\n\n**Testing Requirements:**\n- Test entity extraction on various document types\n- Test custom pattern matching\n- Test keyword extraction with different document lengths\n- Mock spacy models in unit tests\n- Test handling of missing dependencies\n- Verify performance impact is acceptable",

I don't know exactly.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. add proxy-cache plugin to a route\r\n2. run curl command with compression enabled\r\n   ```console\r\n   curl --compressed https://example.com/api/healthz -v --output -\r\n   ```\r\n4. run curl command without compression right afterwards\r\n   ```console\r\n   curl https://example.com/api/healthz -v --output -\r\n   ```\r\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\nThis is my Kubernetes resource:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\napiVersion: configuration.konghq.com/v1\r\nkind: KongPlugin\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: my-cache-1min\r\n  namespace: my-api-v4\r\nconfig:\r\n  cache_ttl: 60\r\n  content_type:\r\n    - text/plain\r\n    - application/json\r\n    - application/json; charset=utf-8\r\n  request_method:\r\n    - GET\r\n    - HEAD\r\n  response_code:\r\n    - 200\r\n  ignore_uri_case: true\r\n  strategy: memory\r\nplugin: proxy-cache\r\n```",

Press any key, app crashes with error `Cannot destructure property 'value' of 'params.props' as it is undefined.`\n\nNote that if you set `age` column's `preProcessEditCellProps` to just return `return params;`, it still crashes but now you get internal datagrid error:\n```ts\nCannot read properties of undefined (reading 'value')\n    at eval (https://2rmfqs.csb.app/node_modules/\nmui/x-data-grid/esm/hooks/features/editing/useGridRowEditing.js:374:44\n```\n\n\n### Current behavior\n\nIf column definition has\n1. `preProcessEditCellProps` defined\n2. `editable: true`\n\nand column cell is set as non-editable by DataGrid prop `isCellEditable` returning `false` for that field, `preProcessEditCellProps` is still called if user edits any cell by starting typing on cell before edit mode is activated.\n\nThis results in `params.props` being undefined (in `preProcessEditCellProps`) and causes app to crash.\n\nThis is extension of recently fixed bug https://github.com/mui/mui-x/issues/17298 \n\n### Expected behavior\n\n`preProcessEditCellProps` should not be called for the column if the cell in question is disabled via DataGrid's `isCellEditable` prop, even if column itself has `editable: true` set (I believe cell editability should have higher priority than column editability)\n\n### Context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Your environment\n\n<details>\n  <summary><code>npx @mui/envinfo</code></summary>\n\n```\n System:\n    OS: macOS 15.4.1\n  Binaries:\n    Node: 20.18.1 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v20.18.1/bin/node\n    npm: 10.8.2 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v20.18.1/bin/npm\n    pnpm: 10.10.0 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v20.18.1/bin/pnpm\n  Browsers:\n    Chrome: 136.0.7103.93\n    Edge: 136.0.3240.64\n    Safari: 18.4\n  npmPackages:\n    @emotion/react: ^11.13.3 => 11.13.3 \n    @emotion/styled: ^11.11.0 => 11.11.0 \n    @mui/core-downloads-tracker:  5.16.14 \n    @mui/icons-material: ^5.16.4 => 5.16.4 \n    @mui/material: ^5.16.14 => 5.16.14 \n    @mui/private-theming:  5.16.14 \n    @mui/styled-engine:  5.16.14 \n    @mui/system:  5.16.14 \n    @mui/types:  7.2.16 \n    @mui/utils:  5.16.14 \n    @mui/x-charts:  7.23.0 \n    @mui/x-charts-pro: ^7.23.0 => 7.23.0 \n    @mui/x-charts-vendor:  7.20.0 \n    @mui/x-data-grid:  7.29.3 \n    @mui/x-data-grid-premium: ^7.29.3 => 7.29.3 \n    @mui/x-data-grid-pro:  7.29.3 \n    @mui/x-date-pickers: ^7.28.0 => 7.28.0 \n    @mui/x-internals:  7.21.0 \n    @mui/x-license: ^7.26.0 => 7.29.1 \n    @mui/x-tree-view: ^7.22.1 => 7.22.1 \n    @types/react: ^17.0.75 => 17.0.76 \n    react: ^18.2.0 => 18.2.0 \n    react-dom: ^18.2.0 => 18.2.0 \n    styled-components: ^5.3.9 => 5.3.9 \n    typescript: ^5.7.3 => 5.7.3 \n```\n</details>\n\n\n\n**Search keywords**: datagrid preprocessEditCellProps isCellEditable",

We need to add more to cover all the code in vllm-ascend, and there are several principles to follow:\n\n1. The overall file tree should be consistent with `vllm_ascend`\n2. The file name should be the original file name with a prefix `test_`\n3. Use `unittest` framework, make good use of mock\n4. The UTs are all running on cpu node, mock the function related to device to host\n\nPlease refer to the official doc on [contributing](https://vllm-ascend.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide/contribution/index.html) and [testing](https://vllm-ascend.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide/contribution/testing.html) to develop, thanks!\n### Unit tests need to add\n\n- [ ] |-- test__version.py\n- [x] |-- test_ascend_config.py\n- [ ] |-- test_attention\n- [ ] |   |-- test_attention.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_attention_v1.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_mla_v1.py\n- [ ] |-- compilation\n- [ ] |   `-- test_piecewise_backend.py\n- [ ] |-- core\n- [ ] |   |-- test_schedule_config.py @nuclearwu\n- [ ] |   `-- test_scheduler.py\n- [ ] |-- device_allocator\n- [ ] |   `-- test_camem.py\n- [ ] |-- distributed\n- [ ] |   |-- test_communicator.py @FieeFlip\n- [ ] |   |-- test_device_communicators\n- [ ] |   |   |-- test_pyhccl.py\n- [ ] |   |   `-- test_pyhccl_wrapper.py\n- [x] |   |-- kv_transfer @Agonixiaoxiao \n- [x] |   |   |-- test_simple_buffer.py https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1531\n- [x] |   |   |-- test_simple_connector.py https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1531\n- [x] |   |   |-- test_simple_pipe.py https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1531\n- [ ] |   |   `-- test_utils.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_llmdatadist_connector.py\n- [x] |   `-- test_parallel_state.py   @wangyanhui-cmss https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1460\n- [ ] |-- test_envs.py\n- [ ] |-- lora\n- [ ] |   `-- punica_wrapper @hongfugui\n- [ ] |       `-- test_punica_npu.py @hongfugui\n- [ ] |-- models\n- [ ] |   |-- test_deepseek_dbo.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_deepseek_mtp.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_deepseek_v2.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_qwen2_5_vl.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_qwen2_5_vl_without_padding.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_qwen2_vl.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_qwen3_moe.py\n- [ ] |-- multistream\n- [ ] |   |-- test_base.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_context.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_decorator.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_layers.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_metadata.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_ms_split.py\n- [ ] |-- ops\n- [ ] |   |-- test_activation.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_attention.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_cache.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_common_fused_moe.py\n- [x] |   |-- test_expert_load_balancer.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_fused_moe.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_layernorm.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_rotary_embedding.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_vocab_parallel_embedding.py\n- [ ] |-- patch\n- [ ] |   |-- platform\n- [ ] |   |   |-- patch_0_9_1\n- [ ] |   |   |-- patch_common\n- [ ] |   |   |   `-- test_test_patch_distributed.py\n- [ ] |   |   `-- patch_main\n- [ ] |   `-- worker\n- [ ] |       |-- patch_0_9_1\n- [ ] |       |-- patch_common\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_distributed.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_eagle.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_minicpm.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_multi_step_worker.py\n- [x] |       |   |-- test_patch_sampler.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_spec_decode_worker.py\n- [ ] |       |   `-- test_patch_utils.py\n- [ ] |       `-- patch_main\n- [x] |-- test_platform.py @zhanghw0354 https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1476\n- [ ] |-- quantization\n- [ ] |   |-- test_func_wrapper.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_quant_config.py @nuclearwu\n- [ ] |   |-- test_quantizer.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_w8a8.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_w8a8_dynamic.py\n- [ ] |-- sample\n- [ ] |   |-- ops\n- [ ] |   `-- test_rejection_sampler.py\n- [x] |-- test_utils.py\n- [ ] `-- worker \n- [ ] |-- test_cache_engine.py @machenglong2025\n- [ ] |-- test_draft_model_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_model_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_model_runner_v1.py\n- [ ]  |-- test_mtp_proposer_v1.py @machenglong2025\n- [ ] |-- test_multi_step_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_multi_step_worker.py\n- [ ] |-- test_pooling_model_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_worker.py @zhanghw0354\n- [ ] `-- test_worker_v1.py @zhanghw0354\n",

I'm [Dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot) and I’m helping the incubator-hugegraph-doc team.\n\n<!-- Answer -->\nTo enable Mermaid diagram rendering in the HugeGraph documentation, add the following to your `config.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[params.mermaid]\nenable = true\n\n[markup]\n  [markup.highlight]\n    guessSyntax = false\n```\n\nThis activates the built-in Docsy/Hugo support for Mermaid diagrams, so code blocks with `mermaid` will render as diagrams instead of raw text. The site already includes the necessary scripts and logic to load and initialize Mermaid.js when this config is present [source](https://github.com/apache/incubator-hugegraph-doc/blob/48ff6f261c634e8d8ae9c4fac9e21524f67424b5/themes/docsy/layouts/partials/scripts.html).\n\nFor image issues: make sure all images referenced in documentation are stored locally (for example, in the `static/` directory) rather than using remote URLs, which can break or be blocked [source](https://github.com/apache/incubator-hugegraph-doc/blob/48ff6f261c634e8d8ae9c4fac9e21524f67424b5/config.toml). Hosting all third-party resources (like Mermaid.js, images, fonts) locally also helps avoid CSP and privacy policy issues [source](https://github.com/apache/incubator-hugegraph-doc/issues/388).\n\nAfter updating the configuration and image locations, rebuild the site and the diagrams/images should render as expected.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

The theme logic in this repo only loads Mermaid scripts if `.Site.Params.mermaid.enable` is set, so the specific `var params = null` TypeError cannot occur here. Your Mermaid diagrams are not rendering because the required config is missing, not due to the upstream bug.\n\nTo fix Mermaid rendering, add this to your `config.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[params.mermaid]\nenable = true\n\n[markup]\n  [markup.highlight]\n    guessSyntax = false\n```\n\nThis will enable Mermaid support and ensure diagrams render as expected.

I guess in theory if we're really careful about the lookup logic (and the KVStore is async) we could do the loading in parallel (though its still a few more requests) but we'd still have to wait on compaction (without a background-compaction task running, which would require a generic `spawn` method...). Seems much easier to just check the length and skip some code for the common case :)", "If I understand it correctly, this is special casing for channels at the beginning of their life and when they grow, the node will switch over to persisting updates and compaction anyway?\n\nTo me it isn't quite clear if this is really worth it. If the hit is significant, it is also a problem when the channel has outgrown the 'small' stage anyway?", "> If I understand it correctly, this is special casing for channels at the beginning of their life and when they grow, the node will switch over to persisting updates and compaction anyway?\n\nYes.\n\n> To me it isn't quite clear if this is really worth it. If the hit is significant, it is also a problem when the channel has outgrown the 'small' stage anyway?\n\nIts more a recognition of two very different cases - if you're running an \"edge node\" that is just a wallet making occasional payments, then you're likely to never hit the \"large\" stage, and thus avoiding the compaction overhead is a really nice optimization. If you're a larger node that is forwarding/processing many payments, you're very likely to hit the \"large\" stage and the compaction penalty is worth it to avoid the writes.", "At what size would the \"large\" stage be entered then typically and how many htlcs/channel updates is that? A channel monitor of a few kb, that doesn't sound like all that many updates?", "Yea, dunno, we'd have to figure that out. I imagine most mobile nodes probably make in the 100s to low 1000s of payments in their entire lifetime, probably fewer on a single channel once you consider splicing and the like. 10KiB or whatever should be plenty for 100 or 250 payments.", "> Its more a recognition of two very different cases\n\nIt sounds like if you wanted to make this automatic, the metric you'd really want to evaluate to switch this behavior isn't so much monitor size, as one of these:\n\n  - Frequency of updates to the channel\n  - Latency of updates to the channel (more difficult)\n\nThe monitor size is a decent reflection of the _number_ of updates to the channel[1], but with no perception of time it's impossible to evaluate whether it's being stored by a tenured edge node, or a routing node. I think if you took time into account, perhaps by using the block delta between the funding tx and chain tip to estimate update frequency, you could make a more informed assessment.\n\nHowever, I worry that automating the behavior selection is not really following the \"principle of least astonishment.\" \n\nI would think that routing nodes rarely move to the edge, and edge nodes rarely become routing nodes (more often, a routing node starts small and may appear like an edge). And furthermore, I know what my node is likely to be; especially if I'm a Lightning developer and managing this on behalf of users, such as in a mobile wallet.\n\nFor that matter, varying the behavior _per channel_ seems to make node persistence more difficult to reason about. Different channels could persist different ways on my node, depending on a size threshold. Which means they can change without me doing anything. I would think that if the reason for variation is the use case, then one behavior is correct for all channels stored by the node.\n\nIn that light, I'd just leave this a configurable behavior, which I think it is now.\n\n[1] I recognize that size is being used here to evaluate the storage write size, not the number of updates. But I think that is why the discussion is unclear. Compared to update count/frequency, it's much harder to know the storage configuration of a given node, and what the throughput/latency tradeoff is like.", "I think the intent of the proposed change is to optimize for the edge-node case with remote storage. Even an edge node may make enough payments to get a monitor up to 10s of KiB in size, at which point network-level effects like TCP slowstart may dominate the actual network latency. For a \"power-user\" edge node, we really want to use the `MonitorUpdatingPersister`, but paying the extra RTT cost of cleanup on load for every edge node is not a great tradeoff either.\n\nFor a routing node, it still seems to me like a size-based threshold may be something they want, purely as it (very marginally) reduces IO throughput for under-utilized or new channels. Writing out updates (padded to 4KiB or more depending on the storage medium) and then consolidating when the whole monitor is only a few KiB isn't really the right tradeoff no matter what. Of course a routing node is expected to surpass the threshold very quickly, so it shouldn't really make a substantial difference, but it seems strictly better to write out full updates in this case than not.\n\nIndeed, this does lead to a bit of behavior shift, but I think the important metrics wouldn't change - first of all, if you happened to look at storage right after compaction, the stored contents would be identical to a full monitor persistence so I wouldn't really say that this materially changes the way that logic would interact with the stored data (you already have to handle the case of having no in-flight updates!). It also shouldn't materially change the IO throughput or write count for any node, just a fairly marginal strict reduction for routing nodes with fresh channels.", "> At what size would the \"large\" stage be entered then typically and how many htlcs/channel updates is that? A channel monitor of a few kb, that doesn't sound like all that many updates?\n\nFor our probing node running ldk-node with network storage (EFS), at around 20,000 updates over the single channel the average probe duration starts to increase substantially. p75 starts to creep up after about 3,000.", "Do y'all have any further thoughts here, @domZippilli or @amackillop?", "> Do y'all have any further thoughts here, [@domZippilli](https://github.com/domZippilli) or [@amackillop](https://github.com/amackillop)?\n\nI see in the PR it's configurable. I think as long as that's the case, developers who don't want the variation in behavior can set the minimum size to `0`.\n\neta: Also, I'm still not sure I like that it varies across channels, rather than a consistent behavior on a node.", "Perhaps wait for developers who do want/need the variation in behavior to show up and only then implement? I think the \"principle of least astonishment\" is worth considering.", "> Perhaps wait for developers who do want/need the variation in behavior to show up and only then implement? I think the \"principle of least astonishment\" is worth considering.\n\nWell, we likely do want to enable MUP in LDK Node, especially when persisting vs. remote storage/VSS. The question is whether it's preferable to *always* use MUP, even for very small monitors. I'd be reluctant to expose a setting in LDK Node for this, as I don't think our users would have better insight into which way to go than we do.", "> Perhaps wait for developers who do want/need the variation in behavior to show up and only then implement? I think the \"principle of least astonishment\" is worth considering.\n\nFWIW I think the \"principle of least astonishment\" is served perfectly fine by changing the MUP to persist full monitors when they're small - there's no material difference in user-visible behavior between persisting full monitors and small ones, except the performance changes (i.e. we definitely can't persist full monitors that are huge). When persisting small monitors, its no difference from hitting the cleanup ID where we delete the updates anyway. Because of this I still think this change is *strictly better* than the current version.", ">there's no material difference in user-visible behavior between persisting full monitors and small ones\n\nThat's clear. I was thinking of least astonishment in reasoning about and resolving potential problems. Basically what @domZippilli mentions in https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/3770#issuecomment-2984271612.\n\nIn this case, I would define 'strictly better' as a performance increase without an increase in complexity." ],

When the API key is empty, the header becomes `Authorization: Basic ` or `Authorization: Bearer `, which is considered an illegal header value by the HTTP library and causes the execution to fail ([source](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/blob/bb955806e042517831b232948c3f9f7150ac5fb6/api/core/workflow/nodes/http_request/executor.py)). The code only checks that the API key field exists, not that it contains a non-empty value.\n\nAs a workaround, avoid configuring HTTPRequest nodes with empty API keys for these auth types. If your workflow might have an empty key, consider adding logic to skip the HTTPRequest node or switch to \"no-auth\" when the key is empty. There’s currently no built-in validation or warning for this in Dify, so it’s a systemic issue, not a new regression.\n\nNo official documentation or existing issues address this yet. It would be helpful for the platform to add validation or user warnings for empty API keys in future releases.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

      "description" : "### Apache Airflow version\n\n3.0.2\n\n### If \"Other Airflow 2 version\" selected, which one?\n\n_No response_\n\n### What happened?\n\nI opened the Trigger Dag form in the Airflow 3 UI and filled in parameters under the section “Run Parameters” (or under “Advanced Options → Configuration JSON”). \n\nWhen I submit the form to backfill a historical date range, the DAG run is created and executes, but the parameters I entered are not actually passed into the tasks. Inside the task, references like {{ params.my_param }} or accessing context[\"params\"][\"my_param\"] remain unset. \n\nAlthough the UI shows the parameters form, these values never make it into the task context. \n\n### What you think should happen instead?\n\nWhen I trigger a backfill from the Airflow 3 UI and enter parameters in the Run Parameters or Advanced Options → Configuration JSON, these values should be passed to each DAG run created during the backfill.\n\nInside the DAG, I should be able to access them using:\n\t•\t{{ params.my_param }} in templates\n\t•\tcontext[\"params\"][\"my_param\"] in Python code\n\nThis is how it works when triggering a single DAG run from the UI, so the behavior should be the same for backfills. The parameters entered in the UI should override the defaults defined in the DAG and be available in all backfilled runs.\n\n### How to reproduce\n\n1.\tCreate the following DAG:\n\n```\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom airflow.decorators import dag, task\nfrom airflow.models.param import Param, ParamsDict\n\n@task\ndef test_backfill_with_params(params: ParamsDict):\n    assert params.get(\"id\") is not None\n\n@dag(\n    dag_id='test_backfill',\n    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),\n    schedule='@daily',\n    catchup=False,\n    default_args={'owner': 'Gery', 'retries': 0},\n    params={\n        \"id\": Param(default=None, title=\"My id\", description=\"My id\", type=[\"null\", \"string\"]),\n    }\n)\ndef test_backfill_dag():\n    test_backfill_with_params()\n\ntest_backfill_dag()\n```\n\n2.\tGo to the Airflow 3 UI.\n3.\tOpen the Backfill modal for the test_backfill DAG.\n4.\tSet a date range (e.g., start and end: 2025-06-01 00:00 and 2025-06-02 00:00).\n5.\tIn the Run Parameters section, set id = \"1234\".\n6.\tTrigger the backfill.\n\nExpected: The DAG run(s) should pass \"id\": \"1234\" to the task, and the assertion should pass.\nActual: The parameter is not passed, and the task fails due to params.get(\"id\") being None.\n\n### Operating System\n\nMac OS 14.6 (23G80)\n\n### Versions of Apache Airflow Providers\n\nNo providers\n\n### Deployment\n\nDocker-Compose\n\n### Deployment details\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Are you willing to submit PR?\n\n- [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n",

However, if you look at all this in General keep in mind that we also have also such scenarios on purpose:\n```\ncontext.requireOnline(purpose, false);\ntry {\n  doSomethingWithNetwork();\n} catch (IOException e) {\n  if (isOfflineMode()) {\n    return false;\n  }\n  throw e;\n}\n```\n\nThe idea of this pattern is that we do not have to do too many pointless online requests (flooding github.com) and prevent that if github.com would be done for whatever reason that this blocks all other network operations of IDEasy.", "While I was looking through the usages of `isOnline()`, I found this method inside `GitContextImpl.java`:\n\n\n```\n  private void handleErrors(Path targetRepository, ProcessResult result) {\n    if (!result.isSuccessful()) {\n      String message = \"Failed to update git repository at \" + targetRepository;\n      if (this.context.isOffline()) {\n        this.context.warning(message);\n        this.context.interaction(\"Continuing as we are in offline mode - results may be outdated!\");\n      } else {\n        this.context.error(message);\n        if (this.context.isOnline()) {\n          this.context.error(\"See above error for details.

Do you want to continue anyways?\");\n      }\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nI am a little bit confused about the functionality: in the `if` it says  `if (this.context.isOffline())` which means `if (!isOnline() || isOfflineMode())` but then in the interaction underneath, it says `\"Continuing as we are in offline mode - results may be outdated!\"` which does not have to be true - we could also be actually offline and not just in offline mode.\n\nThen inside the `else` we check `if (this.context.isOnline())` and then also do an `else` here. This `else` will never be used, as inside this Block `isOnline() && !isOfflineMode()` is true.\n\n@hohwille  Should this method be refactored?" ],

If Seastar doesn't mess this up (e.g., by using a map instead of a list), this can be a way to specify two key components without needing to invent yet another serialization format.\r\n", "According to https://support.datastax.com/s/article/HOW-TO-Specify-composite-partition-keys-for-SSTable-utilities, the colon is expected to work - although this isn't officially specified in the nodetool getendpoints documentation so I'm note sure we should follow this bad advice:\r\n\r\nThe reason why this is a bad syntax is that it makes keys like \"a:b\" ambiguous - is it one component with the \":\" character, or two components? It's not an issue of implementation, it's a bug in nodetool syntax that makes this case ambiguous and nodetool has no idea what the user intended.\r\n\r\n> Since the key is passed over an http-based interface I suggest to allow encoding `:` characters using the standard http encoding as `%3A` substrings (`seastar::http::internal::url_decode` can be used to decode such strings).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if that was your intention, but such encoding (which obviously has to happen when building the REST API URL), will not help to differentiate whether \"a:b\" is two components or one with a colon. Also, if the nodetool API is already ambgious (what does the \"a:b\" the user passed mean?) there is no way that additional encoding can fix it.\r\n\r\nIf you change anything in this area, please don't forget to add tests.", "From the api standpoint what I had in mind is to pass `key=a%3Ab` if the non-composite key (or one of its components) contains `:`.\r\nThe user can pass that to nodetool as well.\r\n\r\nThat said, allowing passing multiple components as request parameters is possible too, though with the current interface it is not intuitive to assume that the multiple key parameters indicate multiple components of a composite key rather than multiple keys, if the API supported returning the natural endpoints for multiple keys.\r\n\r\nNote that `%3A` is supported for `keyspace:table` \"tuples\" when passed as a single parameter or as a comma-separated list of `keyspace:table`, to support keyspace or table names containing `:`.", "> From the api standpoint what I had in mind is to pass `key=a%3Ab` if the non-composite key (or one of its components) contains `:`. The user can pass that to nodetool as well.\r\n\r\n`key=a%3Ab` is the url-encoded form of setting key to `a:b`. But now that Scylla receives it, how does it know if this was intended to be a string key `a:b` or two components?\r\n\r\nMaybe you were thinking of encoding **twice**? If that's the case, the first layer of encoding doesn't need to be URL encoding. Just the outer layer of encoding must be.\r\n\r\nAre you sure about what you said about `keyspace:table` allowing real \":\"? Last time I checked, I found that at least in one context, you are only allowed to have colons in the table name, not keyspace name (e.g., in Alternator GSI), and what happens is simply that Scylla splits only on the first colon, so `xyz:abc:qwe` means that `xyz` is the keyspace, `abc:qwe` is the table.

Some ideas raised in this issue required even more explicit changes to nodetool that would need to be tested.\n\nPlease also see my recommendation in https://github.com/scylladb/scylladb/pull/24720 to improve the commit message to say exactly what we're fixing and what we aren't, and also consider which documentation we need to update to explain the situation with the colon.\n\n> \n> [@denesb](https://github.com/denesb) should review\n\n" ],

I am a beginner, so please excuse any mistakes or oversights!\r\n\r\n\r\n", "@spranav1205 Hi, thanks for looking into this !\r\n\r\nNowadays Python's standard lib is richer and I think we can go with a simpler desgin that the one that was choosen at the time for `time_support` and `quantity_support`.\r\nIn particular, for this specific task of combining existing context managers, I think we should use (or take inspiration from) [`contextlib.ExitStack`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.ExitStack).", "We can use the following approach to combine `quantity_support` and `time_support` using a function, without the need for a class:\r\n\r\n    @contextmanager\r\n    def astro_support():\r\n     \r\n        q = quantity_support()\r\n        t = time_support()\r\n        \r\n        try:\r\n            q.__enter__()\r\n            t.__enter__()\r\n            yield  \r\n        finally:\r\n            q.__exit__()\r\n            t.__exit__()\r\n\r\nWith this implementation, astro_support can be used as a context manager with the `with` statement, but it can't be used independently like` quantity_support()` or `time_support()`.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we can implement `astro_support` as a class, which can act both as a context manager (with `with`) and as a decorator for functions. This would look something like:\r\n\r\n    class astro_support(ContextDecorator):\r\n              def __init__(self):\r\n                  # Call both quantity and time support functions and assign them to a class variable, e.g., self.q_support\r\n                 \r\n              def __enter__(self):\r\n                  # Enter both quantity and time support context\r\n                  \r\n              def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):\r\n                  # Exit both quantity and time support context\r\n                  \r\nWould you like me to implement either of these? Or should we explore some other method?\r\n", "Actually the `contextlib.contexmanager` implementation also allows using it as a decorator\r\n\r\nquoting from https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.contextmanager\r\n> [contextmanager()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.contextmanager) uses [ContextDecorator](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.ContextDecorator) so the context managers it creates can be used as decorators as well as in [with](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#with) statements. When used as a decorator, a new generator instance is implicitly created on each function call (this allows the otherwise “one-shot” context managers created by [contextmanager()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.contextmanager) to meet the requirement that context managers support multiple invocations in order to be used as decorators).\r\n\r\nSo my preference is to go with the first approach as it's simpler. Note that it is generally not recommended to call so-called dunder[^1] methods like `__enter__` and `__exit__` directly, so I would favor something like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom contextlib import contextmanager, ExitStack\r\n\r\n@contextmanager\r\ndef astro_support():\r\n    with ExitStack() as stack:\r\n        stack.enter_context(quantity_support())\r\n        stack.enter_context(time_support())\r\n        yield\r\n```\r\n\r\n[^1]: \"dunder\" is short for \"double underscore\" and is a common way to refer to Python's protocols that are named with two leading and two trailing underscores", "Yes, this works perfectly. I have opened a PR #17575. I will update the changelog and add a test case shortly!", "Hi @astropy/core team \uD83D\uDC4B\nI'd love to help close out issue #8860 (“enable both quantity_support and time_support in one go”). I saw PR #17979 is already addressing this great start!\nI can help with:\n\nAdding unit tests (both context manager and decorator use cases)\nUpdating the visualization documentation\nWould it be helpful if I take this on next?" ],

      "description" : "## Describe the bug\r\n\r\nThe [Icinga 2 API Event Stream documentation](https://icinga.com/docs/icinga-2/latest/doc/12-icinga2-api/#event-streams) states that the required `queue` parameter used to subscribe to the Event Stream must have an \"[u]nique queue name [and] [m]ultiple HTTP clients can use the same queue as long as they use the same event types and filter\".\r\n\r\nHowever, currently there is no functionality bound to the `queue` parameter next to a check for its presence.\r\nhttps://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/blob/2c9117b4f71e00b2072e7dbe6c4ea4e48c882a87/lib/remote/eventshandler.cpp#L81-L86\r\n\r\nIt seems like it's logic was removed in #7088, especially 81713d0509e5c686a4d038a237f367d438703120. Within this PR, the change regarding `queue` was [noted](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/pull/7088#issuecomment-480358802), but no further decisions were made.\r\n\r\n## To Reproduce\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI would expect the documentation to match the actual logic.\r\n\r\nAs I recently started using the Event Stream API a lot, I relied on the documented behavior, but, fortunately, did not ran in any errors - or at least non I know of. Thus, if the uniqueness constraint is not enforced anyway, maybe drop the whole parameter or change the code again to match the documented restrictions. As I myself do not know Icinga 2's internal well enough, I cannot say what would be best.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n## Your Environment\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nn/a",

You can find the list of necessary connectors and configuration guidance here: [DLP Configuration – Copilot Studio Kit](https://github.com/microsoft/Power-CAT-Copilot-Studio-Kit/blob/main/TECHDETAILS.md#connectors-used-for-dlp-configuration-purposes)\n\n- Confirm Prerequisites\nBefore reinstalling, please double-check that all prerequisites are met as outlined in the documentation to ensure a smooth setup.", "Thanks for your answer. However even after trying all those steps, I end up with the same result. I can confirm that the DLP configuration allows all types of connectors and that all the prerequisities are checked." ],

Division Protection (Current: 1e-6f)\nUsed in BRDF visibility functions to prevent division by zero:\n```hlsl\nreturn rcp(max(Vis_SmithV * Vis_SmithL, 1e-6f));\n```\n**Files:** package/Shaders/Common/BRDF.hlsli\n\n#### 2. Dot Product Clamping (Current: 1e-5)\nEnsures lighting terms don't go to zero:\n```hlsl\nfloat NdotL = clamp(dot(N, L), 1e-5, 1);\nfloat NdotV = saturate(abs(dot(N, V)) + 1e-5);\n```\n**Files:** package/Shaders/Common/PBR.hlsli, various feature shaders\n\n#### 3. Distance/Radius Thresholds (Current: 1e-4)\nUsed for geometric and lighting distance checks:\n```hlsl\nfloat distance = max(length(lightVector), 1e-4);\n```\n**Files:** Various lighting feature shaders\n\n#### 4. Specialized Precision (Current: 1e-8, 1e-10)\n- **1e-8**: Glints ellipse ratio calculations\n- **1e-10**: Spherical harmonics weight normalization\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nAdd domain-specific epsilon constants to Math.hlsli using #define to match current HLSL constant practices:\n\n```hlsl\n// Domain-specific epsilon values for numerical stability\n#define EPSILON_DIVISION    1e-6f    // For rcp() division protection\n#define EPSILON_DOT_CLAMP   1e-5f    // For NdotL/NdotV clamping\n#define EPSILON_DISTANCE    1e-4f    // For distance/radius thresholds\n#define EPSILON_GLINTS      1e-8f    // For glints calculations\n#define EPSILON_WEIGHT_SUM  1e-10f   // For weight normalization\n```\n\n## Files Requiring Updates\n\nBased on analysis, the following files contain hardcoded epsilon values that should be replaced:\n\n- package/Shaders/Common/BRDF.hlsli (1e-6f → EPSILON_DIVISION)\n- package/Shaders/Common/PBR.hlsli (1e-5 → EPSILON_DOT_CLAMP)\n- features/DynamicCubemaps/Shaders/DynamicCubemaps/DynamicCubemaps.hlsli (0.00001 → EPSILON_DOT_CLAMP)\n- features/Skylighting/Shaders/Skylighting/Skylighting.hlsli (1e-10 → EPSILON_WEIGHT_SUM)\n- features/ScreenSpaceGI/Shaders/ScreenSpaceGI/ScreenSpaceGI.hlsli (1e-4 → EPSILON_DISTANCE)\n- features/TerrainBlending/Shaders/TerrainBlending/TerrainBlending.hlsli (1e-4 → EPSILON_DISTANCE)\n- Various other feature shader files\n\n## Benefits\n\n1. **Consistency**: Same epsilon values used for identical mathematical purposes\n2. **Maintainability**: Single location to adjust epsilon values if needed\n3. **Documentation**: Clear intent through descriptive constant names\n4. **Standards Compliance**: Uses #define convention matching existing HLSL constants\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n- Different epsilon values serve mathematically distinct purposes with different sensitivity requirements\n- Performance impact is zero - different epsilon values have no measurable performance cost on modern GPUs\n- Domain-specific precision is necessary to avoid either visible artifacts or unnecessary precision loss\n\n## Related\n\n- PR #1226: Added NaN prevention checks to BRDF visibility functions using 1e-6f values\n- Discussion in PR #1226 comment thread about epsilon standardization\n\nBacklinks:\n- PR: https://github.com/doodlum/skyrim-community-shaders/pull/1226\n- Comment: https://github.com/doodlum/skyrim-community-shaders/pull/1226#issuecomment-discussion",

Start by exploring our [Contributing](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines, and don't forget to check out our [workspace setup guidelines](https://devdocs.jabref.org/getting-into-the-code/guidelines-for-setting-up-a-local-workspace) to get started smoothly.\n\nFor questions on JabRef functionality and the code base, you can consult the [JabRef Guru](https://gurubase.io/g/jabref) or ask on our Gitter chat.\n\nIn case you encounter failing tests during development, please check our [developer FAQs](https://devdocs.jabref.org/code-howtos/faq.html)!\n\nHaving any questions or issues? Feel free to ask here on GitHub. Need help setting up your local workspace? Join the conversation on [JabRef's Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/JabRef/jabref). And don't hesitate to open a (draft) pull request early on to show the direction it is heading towards. This way, you will receive valuable feedback.\n\nHappy coding! \uD83D\uDE80", "@Munhangyeol May I ask you about your timeline? This is kind of important as our tests are not green any more :)", "@Munhangyeol When working on this, please update the sub modules and fix the mentioned tests. With #13429 I created a workaround PR to revert to the old state (which a working main branch)", "@koppor I'm getting an error saying ```build-logic/java-module-packaging``` does not exist when trying to build.\nI already updated submodules using ```git submodule update --init --recursive```, but it didn't resolve the issue.\nDo I need to do anything else?\n", "@koppor I'm currently working on something else, but I think I can take care of it later this week.\nWould that be too late? \uD83D\uDE25", "@Munhangyeol We are currently in the process of improving the build. I quote from the community chat:\n\nDue to some experiments with the gradle build, one needs to do some extra step to keep the build running\n\n    cd build-logic\n    git clone https://github.com/koppor/java-module-packaging.git\n\nWe think, this won't be necessary in about one week - but whoever works on JabRef now and updates main should be aware", "> [@koppor](https://github.com/koppor) I'm currently working on something else, but I think I can take care of it later this week. Would that be too late? \uD83D\uDE25\n\nIt's very OK as we fixed `main` by reverting the breaking change. If you base on main, you need to \n\n    git revert d0717a09f5c3b7da80cfb28ac702121c5afa8d3c\n\nand then start coding :)" ],

      "repositoryName" : "elizaOS/eliza",
      "description" : "# Migrate remaining CLI input methods to use @clack/prompts for consistency\n\n## \uD83C\uDFAF Summary\n\nCurrently, the CLI uses a mix of input libraries (`inquirer`, Bun's global `prompt()`, and `@clack/prompts`). We should standardize on `@clack/prompts` for a consistent user experience and better styling across all CLI interactions.\n\n## \uD83D\uDCCB Current State\n\nMost of the CLI already uses `@clack/prompts` properly, but there are **2 main files** still using other input methods:\n\n### 1. `src/utils/plugin-creator.ts` - Using `inquirer` \uD83D\uDCE6\n\nThis file has multiple `inquirer.prompt()` calls that need to be migrated:\n\n- **Plugin specification collection** (~line 172-290):\n  - Plugin name input\n  - Plugin description input  \n  - Plugin features input\n  - Component selection (checkbox)\n  - Action names input\n  - Provider names input\n  - Evaluator names input\n  - Service names input\n\n### 2. `scripts/generate-unit-tests.ts` - Using global `prompt()` \uD83D\uDD27\n\n- **Test generation confirmation** (~line 165):\n  ```typescript\n  const answer = prompt('Generate tests? (y/n): ');\n  ```\n\n## ✨ Benefits of Migration\n\n1. **Consistent UX** - All CLI interactions will have the same look and feel\n2. **Better styling** - Clack provides superior visual design and animations\n3. **Better error handling** - Clack has built-in cancellation handling\n4. **Reduced dependencies** - Can remove `inquirer` from package.json\n5. **Type safety** - Better TypeScript integration\n\n## \uD83D\uDD27 Implementation Examples\n\n### For `plugin-creator.ts`:\n\n**Before (inquirer):**\n```typescript\nconst answers = await inquirer.prompt([\n  {\n    type: 'input',\n    name: 'name',\n    message: 'Plugin name (without \"plugin-\" prefix):',\n    validate: (input: string) => input.length > 0 || 'Plugin name is required'\n  }\n]);\n```\n\n**After (clack):**\n```typescript\nconst name = await clack.text({\n  message: 'Plugin name (without \"plugin-\" prefix):',\n  validate: (input) => input.length > 0 ? undefined : 'Plugin name is required'\n});\n\nif (clack.isCancel(name)) {\n  clack.cancel('Operation cancelled.');\n  process.exit(0);\n}\n```\n\n### For `generate-unit-tests.ts`:\n\n**Before:**\n```typescript\nconst answer = prompt('Generate tests? (y/n): ');\n```\n\n**After:**\n```typescript\nconst answer = await clack.confirm({\n  message: 'Generate tests?',\n  initialValue: true\n});\n\nif (clack.isCancel(answer)) {\n  console.log('Cancelled.');\n  return;\n}\n```\n\n## ✅ Reference Files (Already Using Clack)\n\nThese files are already properly implemented and serve as good examples:\n- `src/commands/create/actions/creators.ts`\n- `src/commands/create/index.ts`\n- `src/commands/env/actions/edit.ts`\n- `src/commands/publish/utils/validation.ts`\n- `src/utils/cli-prompts.ts`\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Replace all `inquirer.prompt()` calls in `plugin-creator.ts` with clack equivalents\n- [ ] Replace global `prompt()` call in `generate-unit-tests.ts` with clack\n- [ ] Remove `inquirer` dependency from `package.json` if no longer used elsewhere\n- [ ] Ensure all prompts handle cancellation properly (ctrl+c)\n- [ ] Test plugin creation flow works identically to current behavior\n- [ ] Test unit test generation script works identically to current behavior\n- [ ] Maintain existing validation logic and error messages\n- [ ] Update any related TypeScript types if needed\n\n## \uD83C\uDFAF Priority\n\n**Medium** - This improves developer experience and code consistency but doesn't affect core functionality.\n\n## \uD83D\uDCA1 Implementation Notes\n\n- The `generate-unit-tests.ts` part would be a good **beginner-friendly** task\n- The `plugin-creator.ts` part is more complex due to multiple sequential prompts\n- Consider breaking this into two separate PRs if needed\n- Make sure to test the checkbox selection for component types in plugin creation\n\n---\n\n**Note**: The majority of the CLI already uses clack properly - this is just cleaning up the last few stragglers to ensure complete consistency across the entire CLI experience.",

This is personal opinion however I believe snapshottest's approach of auto-creating the snapshots when missing is problematic. Imagine if you've written a number of new test cases and forget to create the relevant snapshots. If you push up your changes to your version control system and your CI system runs the test suite, with auto-create functionality, the tests will pass. This gives a false sense of confidence in the test suite. For all you know, the generated snapshot could be different every CI run.\r\n\r\nSyrupy's stance is that a missing snapshot is no different from a non-matching snapshot. Syrupy has no way of knowing that you've just written a new test case and so we expect a snapshot not to exist, vs. a test case has been renamed disconnecting it from the snapshot file, or the dev forgot to commit the snapshot artifacts to git when pushing up their branch for CI to run.", "why not use a CI option to throw on missing tests like jest does? ", "I'm open to that idea. I'd still want it to be opt-in though.", "I would also like to add a vote for this, a team member just added syrupy to one of our repos but previously we have just done this manually.\nIn those implementations, we always set it up so if the comparison file is missing, it generates it and then fails the test with an Error message stating it has created the file.\nThe next run would then pass.\n\nThis means that if it was missing due to not being committed or some other reason, it should still fail in CI. But yes makes it a lot easier to update the expectations from within an ide \uD83D\uDC4D \n\nOn that note, it would also be great if it is opt-in, if it was possible through a config file or env var. I think it would be possible to set the flag in the IDE but it would be nicer to not have to mess with pycharm settings to turn that behaviour on.\n\nThanks" ],

      "comments" : [ "Hey Seaders, thanks for your Issue!\n\n---\n\n### Recommendation\n\nMy recommendation is to keep your two declaration files separate. This approach makes your content declarations more maintainable and flexible, especially if you plan to use the visual editor.\n\n```ts\nimport { type DeclarationContent } from 'intlayer';\n\nconst overviewContent = {\n  key: 'overview',\n  content: {\n    header: 'Do all this awesome stuff with ',\n    subHeader: ['With ', \" you'll be even more awesome!\"],\n  },\n} satisfies DeclarationContent;\n\nexport default overviewContent;\n```\n\n```tsx\nimport { useIntlayer } from 'next-intlayer'; // or react-intlayer\nimport { type FC } from 'react';\n\nexport const YourComponent: FC = () => {\n  const { brandName, brandNameShort } = useIntlayer('app');\n  const { header, subHeader } = useIntlayer('overview');\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>\n        {header}\n        {brandName}\n      </h1>\n      <h2>\n        {subHeader[0]}\n        {brandNameShort}\n        {subHeader[1]}\n      </h2>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```\n\n### Alternative: Importing One Content File into Another\n\nIf you'd like to use TypeScript declaration files, an alternative is to import one content file into the other.\n\nHere’s an example:\n\n```ts\nimport { type DeclarationContent } from 'intlayer';\nimport appContent from './app.content';\n\nconst overviewContent = {\n  key: 'overview',\n  content: {\n    header: `Do all this awesome stuff with ${appContent.content.brandName}`,\n    subHeader: `With ${appContent.content.brandNameShort}, you'll be even more awesome!`,\n  },\n} satisfies DeclarationContent;\n\nexport default overviewContent;\n```\n\nIt will works properly, but the limitation of this approach is its compatibility with the visual editor for your `overviewContent` content declaration file. The editor will interpret `Do all this awesome stuff with Other Detail: Company Name` as a single string fully declared in your `overviewContent` declaration file. The visual editor does not interpret nested declaration for now.\n\n### Alternative: Using Component Logic\n\nAnother option is to call your content as a string using `.value` and replace placeholders with JavaScript's `replace` function.\n\n```tsx\nimport { useIntlayer } from 'next-intlayer'; // or react-intlayer\nimport { type FC } from 'react';\n\nexport const YourComponent: FC = () => {\n  const { brandName, brandNameShort } = useIntlayer('app');\n  const { header, subHeader } = useIntlayer('overview');\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>{header.value.replace('%%{app.brandName}%%', brandName.value)}</h1>\n      <h2>\n        {subHeader.value.replace(\n          '%%{app.brandNameShort}%%',\n          brandNameShort.value\n        )}\n      </h2>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nHowever, this approach sacrifices the benefits of the `IntlayerNode` (type returned by objects like `brandName`, `brandNameShort`, `header`, or `subHeader`). These types enable features such as displaying the content selector within the visual editor.\n\n### Content Nesting\n\nI know that **i18next** offers a similar feature called [`nesting`](https://www.i18next.com/translation-function/nesting). Would this be a feature you'd like to see in Intlayer? If so, and if there’s enough interest from others, let me know. I’d be happy to add it to the roadmap.\n\n---\n\n### Updated Visual Editor Documentation\n\nRegarding the visual editor: A new documentation has been released since Intlayer v4. The previous visual editor have been slitted into two tools :\n- [Intlayer visual editor (for locale declaration files)](https://intlayer.org/doc/concept/editor)\n- [Intlayer CMS (for distant dictionaries)](https://intlayer.org/doc/concept/cms)\n\nBecause of a big refactor regarding the approach, the visual editor will be released in the coming days with version 4.1.0. Meanwhile, we are still working on improvements related to the CMS, which will be fully available next weeks.", "I don't love option one because if `brandName` comes first in one language, we'd need to have an empty entry first, then `brandName`, then the second entry.  I think I'll probably go with option 2 until I get the visual editor working fully right at least, but i18n's nesting does look the most ideal solution (but also definitely the most complex one too, unfortunately).\n\nOne way or another, thanks so much for the comprehensive response, and, overall your work on this, it's massively appreciated.", "Hi @seaders !\n\nJust to communicate the release of [nesting](https://intlayer.org/doc/concept/content/nesting) feature sice the v5! \n\nI hope it will match your needs", "I FINALLY got around to this @aymericzip thanks so much for your work on this, it really is great and appreciated.\n\nI think? I'm using it correctly, but I did find one issue where I'm not sure if it's my incorrect usage.\n\nUsing this dictionary code,\n\n```\nimport { nest, type Dictionary } from \"intlayer\"\n\nconst brandNameShort = nest(\"app\", \"brandNameShort\")\n\nexport default {\n  key: \"overview\",\n  content: {\n    publishHeader: (\n      <>\n        Publish your product listings in the {brandNameShort} Mobile Web\n        Application or in the {brandNameShort} Chrome Extension\n      </>\n    ),\n    brandNameShort\n  }\n} satisfies Dictionary\n```\n\nand this view code,\n\n```\n  const { brandNameShort } = useIntlayer(\"app\")\n  const overview = useIntlayer(\"overview\")\n  console.log(\"overview\", overview)\n\n  return (\n      <h2>{brandNameShort}</h2>\n      <h2>{overview.brandNameShort}</h2>\n      <h2>{overview.publishHeader}</h2>\n  )\n```\n\nThe correct brand name is shown under \"brandNameShort\", coming from the app dictionary, \"overview.brandNameShort\", coming, nested, from the overview dictionary, but for \"overview.publishHeader\", I get\n\n> Publish your product listings in the Mobile Web Application or in the Chrome Extension\n\nAgain, not totally sure if this is by design or not, but I just thought I'd point it out to you.  Thanks again!", "Hey @seaders! Thanks for the feedback!\n\nMaybe have a look to the [insert function](https://intlayer.org/doc/concept/content/insertion)\n\nBut the combinaison of nesting + insertion + react node is not supported for now\n\nA way to fix it\n \n```ts\nimport { nest, insert, type Dictionary } from \"intlayer\"\n\nexport default {\n  key: \"overview\",\n  content: {\n    publishHeader: insert(\"Publish your product listings in the {{brandNameShort}} Mobile Web.

      "description" : "## The problem\r\n\r\n<!-- Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.\r\nA clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when -->\r\n\r\nWe have enabled [strict types](https://www.phptutorial.net/php-tutorial/php-strict_types/) already in https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/pull/1350, however this lead to issues like https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/issues/1435. It is an example of what can happen, if type casting goes wrong.\r\n\r\nNote generally, if we have strict types, we should also declare what types we use, just as other programming languages. A discussion of advantages of strict typing vs loose (or no) typing (at all, what PHP did before) goes beyond the scope of this issue, but in short:\r\n> Type hinting in method parameters or class properties is very useful and it helps you catch type errors before you run your code. \r\n\r\nhttps://dev.to/rocksheep/the-way-stricttypes-works-in-php-eb7\r\nMore here: https://dev.to/robdwaller/how-php-type-declarations-actually-work-1mm5\r\n\r\nAs [PHP nowadays supports type hints/type declarations](https://stackoverflow.com/a/29967975/5008962) as of PHP v7\r\n\r\n## The solution\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. Pitch your solution! What would happen, if we don't implement this? -->\r\n\r\n* [x] first of all, check, if strict types are enabled in all files (excluding dependencies of course)\r\n* [ ] step by step, convert the code [and add type declarations](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.declarations.php) to the functions, both for arguments as well as\r\n* [ ] test that everything still works as wanted, both via unit tests and manual tests\r\n* [ ] AFAIK, you can then remove the PHPDoc parts that only explain the types (like return values or arguments). But let's test that they appear the same in [PHPDoc](https://phpdoc.org/).\r\n\r\nSome hints:\r\n* One can use the existing PHPdoc as a very good reference, at best it works the same and the documented type is really what the runtime really wants. However, there may be edge cases or cases where it is not \"quite right\" (as obviously it was never enforced by the [PHP] interpreter), so take it with a grain of salt!\r\n* Especially for contributors: Start with one file! Or generally, take it step by step. You can easily do multiple PRs and start small by converting only one or two files to stricter types. It can be gradually done.\r\n\r\n## Alternatives\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered. -->\r\nLeave it as it is, it should stay compatible as PHP is very backwards-compatible. However, modern code and many other programming languages embrace type casting/strict/strong(er) typing, so this is IMHO a good way, we should follow.\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\r\n* Bonus: Maybe we find a linter tool or can configure sth. to alert us about missing type declarations in the future? This would help:\r\n  1. to discover missing declarations\r\n  2. to enforce a new coding style that requires type declarations for PHP code\r\n\r\nAlso, as it is a feature starting with PHP 7, but which has been gradually enhanced, we obviously need to make sure it works with all supported PHP versions:\r\nhttps://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/blob/d23bb748d45bb8cde8f3737b632d7ddd6a383e35/lib/Controller.php#L32-L37\r\n\r\nEdit: corrected canonical location for minimum supported PHP version lookup in PrivateBin internally",

If the screen width becomes smaller, the settings on the right-hand side (day-nightmode, language & theme) should move to the line below right-aligned (as with the bootsrap theme). If the display becomes even smaller, the other settings follow and also move to the line below (left-aligned).

Please explain\n\n#6882 created a cache that sped up circuit construction if only \"append\" (or equivalent \"insert\" at end w/ EARLIEST strategy) was used. If other types of \"insert\", \"delete\", or any other circuit mutation was used (see instances of `_placement_cache = None`), the cache was simply deleted and subsequent mutations (including appends) fell back to the old \"check every moment\" algorithm.\n\n## Describe the solution you would prefer\n\nThere are probably some clever algorithms or data structures that could maintain the placement cache through more types of mutations. Or another option could be if the placement cache was deleted and subsequently the user calls a few \"appends\" in a row, to assume there are more coming and have some code that regenerates the placement cache a-priori. (It'd be nice to see some real-world use cases of large circuits that use mutations other than \"append\", to make sure any solution is optimizing the right thing).\n\n## How urgent is this for you? Is it blocking important work?\n\n<!-- Please choose one of the following options and remove the others -->\n**P3** – I'm not really blocked by it; it's an idea I'm proposing based on principle\n",

It's not possible to ask our users to install a legacy version of ffmpeg, especially since it will require users to build from the source.\n\nTo fix this, we have to decide to use the latest LTS version, 7.1, which is in active maintenance mode.\n\nI believe API changes will be between the current version, 6.0.0, and the new version (7.1.1). So, the current implementation of the wasmedge-ffmpeg plugin will also need to be modified.\n\n\n### Details\n\nThe following action items should be finished:\n\n- [ ] Update to the new ffmpeg version 7.1.1\n- [ ] Modify the implementation of wasmedge-ffmpeg\n- [ ] Ensure the CI passes for building and testing\n\n### Appendix\n\n_No response_",

      "description" : "### What happened?\r\n\r\nOK, so, I'm trying to train a Flux LoRa (Loha to be precise) with one additional embedding\r\nDuring training, samples look like they are really excellent, much more so than without the additional embedding, so this seems to be of great effect. \r\nHowever, in comfyui, i did not get results as good as in the samples (it looked very undertrained). While looking at the console output of comfy, here is what I see : \r\n\r\n> WARNING: shape mismatch when trying to apply embedding, embedding will be ignored 768 != 4096\r\n> WARNING: shape mismatch when trying to apply embedding, embedding will be ignored 768 != 4096\r\n> WARNING: shape mismatch when trying to apply embedding, embedding will be ignored 768 != 4096\r\n> WARNING: shape mismatch when trying to apply embedding, embedding will be ignored 768 != 4096\r\n\r\nOut of curiosity, I looked at the embedding in an Hex editor, since the files are small, well, it was worth a shot and it starts with some json data of what I suppose is the description of the binary data structure of the embedding:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"clip_g\": {\r\n        \"dtype\": \"BF16\",\r\n        \"shape\": [\r\n            4,\r\n            768\r\n        ],\r\n        \"data_offsets\": [\r\n            0,\r\n            6144\r\n        ]\r\n    },\r\n    \"t5\": {\r\n        \"dtype\": \"BF16\",\r\n        \"shape\": [\r\n            4,\r\n            4096\r\n        ],\r\n        \"data_offsets\": [\r\n            6144,\r\n            38912\r\n        ]\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nSo, this makes me wonder if there is an issue with the way the embedding is written to disk since Flux is supposed to be CLIP_L+T5, whereas here, I see CLIP_G+T5 ?\r\n\r\nI trained the same dataset on SDXL to see how the clip_l section looked like and it clearly states \"clip_l\".\r\nIn the SDXL database, the clip_g dimension was [4,1280] while the clip_l dimension was [4,768]\r\n\r\nthe dtype was F32 instead of BF16 and the offsets were doubled, but it was consistent with the output data type of the files I forgot to change from FLOAT32 to BF16 in this second run.\r\n\r\nI tried to change in the Hex editor clip_g to clip_l, but comfy simply ignored the embedding.\r\nI know the embedding must have some kind of effect since running the same seed without the embedding is even worse.\r\n\r\nNow, can someone confirm that, this embedding is actually properly formatted and therefore, there is a bug in the comfyui parser of the embedding, or did I actually found a bug in OneTrainer ?\r\n\r\nThank you, this piece of software is awesome !\r\n\r\n\r\n### What did you expect would happen?\r\n\r\nSame quality between samples during training and comfyui output\r\n\r\n### Relevant log output (this is from Comfyui, just to be clear)\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nWARNING: shape mismatch when trying to apply embedding, embedding will be ignored 768 != 4096\r\nWARNING: shape mismatch when trying to apply embedding, embedding will be ignored 768 != 4096\r\nWARNING: shape mismatch when trying to apply embedding, embedding will be ignored 768 != 4096\r\nWARNING: shape mismatch when trying to apply embedding, embedding will be ignored 768 != 4096\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Output of `pip freeze`\r\n\r\n_No response_",

T\"", "I would still be interested in having this. Say you captioned image \"backgrounds\" (not the people behavior and appearance in it, but the setting they are in, landscape etc). Then it would make sense to generate an \"inverted\" mask with rembg to make it pick up on those parts of the image much faster. I guess one could work out a batch-workflow using imagemagick -negate or something similar to get the same effect, but it would be so much easier and less error prone this way." ],

(Can be useful for custom beacon effects)\n\n[Handshake](https://papermc.io/javadocs/index.html?com/destroystokyo/paper/event/player/PlayerHandshakeEvent.html) Event\n- This event is fired during a player handshake. (Can be useful for some stuff)\n- **WARNING: TAMPERING WITH THIS EVENT CAN BE DANGEROUS**\n\n[PlayerArmorChange](https://papermc.io/javadocs/index.html?com/destroystokyo/paper/event/player/PlayerArmorChangeEvent.html) Event\n- Called when the player themselves change their armor items  (Can be useful for detecting armor for some custom enchant related stuff)\n\n[View distance](https://papermc.io/javadocs/org/bukkit/entity/Player.html)\n- Pretty much changing the view distance of a player (Can be useful to reduce lag)\n\n[Set arrow stuck](https://papermc.io/javadocs/org/bukkit/entity/Player.html)\n- Changing the amount of arrows stuck in the player (Can be useful to become a porcupine, crash your fps, and remove those arrows that are stuck on to you.)\n\n[PlayerUseUnknownEntity](https://papermc.io/javadocs/index.html?com/destroystokyo/paper/event/player/PlayerUseUnknownEntityEvent.html) event\n- called when a player interacts with a client sided/fake entity\n- vanilla Skript now has client-side blocks so this might be useful\n\n[Tab Header/Footer](https://papermc.io/javadocs/org/bukkit/entity/Player.html)\n- Can set the header/footer of the tab list.\n\n[Protocol Version](https://papermc.io/javadocs/index.html?org/bukkit/entity/Player.html)\n- Can get the protocol version number that the player is currently using.\n- List of Protocol Version numbers, https://wiki.vg/Protocol_version_numbers\n\n[PlayerReadyArrowEvent](https://papermc.io/javadocs/com/destroystokyo/paper/event/player/PlayerReadyArrowEvent.html) Event\n- Called when a player is firing a bow and the server is choosing an arrow to use.\n- Can be good to combine with the shoot event.\n\n[Actionbar](https://papermc.io/javadocs/org/bukkit/entity/Player.html)\n- Can be used to send an action bar to the player\n\n[UnknownCommandEvent](https://papermc.io/javadocs/org/bukkit/event/command/UnknownCommandEvent.html)\n- Can be used to change the message of a undefined command.\n\n[SpongeAbsorbEvent](https://papermc.io/javadocs/org/bukkit/event/block/SpongeAbsorbEvent.html)\n- **(This event was added in 1.13.2)**\n- Called when a sponge absorbs water from the world. \n- Can be spammy when you have to debug it\n- This event won't change it back to 1.7 sponge mechanics, since the sponge will end up not absorbing the water around it.\n\n[InventoryCloseEvent Reason](https://papermc.io/javadocs/org/bukkit/event/inventory/InventoryCloseEvent.html)\n- Returns the reason why the inventory got closed\n\n[Here's Johnny](https://papermc.io/javadocs/org/bukkit/entity/Vindicator.html)\n- When in Johnny mode the Vindicator will be hostile to any kind of mob, except for evokers, ghasts, illusioners and other vindicators. It will even be hostile to vexes. All mobs, except for endermites, phantoms, guardians, slimes and magma cubes, will try to attack the vindicator in return.\n\n<!--- A clear and concise description of the suggestion --->\n##",

An Ultralytics engineer will review and assist you soon. Thank you for your willingness to contribute! \uD83D\uDEE0️", "Thanks for the detailed analysis! You're absolutely right about the XPU support limitations. The main areas that need updates for full XPU support are:\n\n1. The [`autocast` function](https://docs.ultralytics.com/reference/utils/torch_utils/#ultralytics.utils.torch_utils.autocast) in `torch_utils.py` currently only handles CUDA and CPU devices\n2. The [`check_amp` function](https://docs.ultralytics.com/reference/utils/checks/#ultralytics.utils.checks.check_amp) returns `False` for non-CUDA devices\n3. The [`select_device` function](https://docs.ultralytics.com/reference/utils/torch_utils/#ultralytics.utils.torch_utils.select_device) needs XPU device handling for auto-batch functionality\n\nYour PR would be very welcome! Please focus on extending these utility functions to properly detect and handle XPU devices, especially for AMP support since PyTorch does indeed support AMP on XPU.

Your comprehensive XPU implementation looks very solid and the performance improvements you're seeing are impressive. The simplified autocast approach in your latest comment is much cleaner and should handle both CUDA and XPU properly.\n\nSince you've got a working implementation with all the key components (device detection, AMP support, memory handling), I'd suggest either you or @huahuadeliaoliao submit a PR with these changes. The attached files provide a great foundation - just make sure to test the device detection logic handles edge cases like `device=\"xpu:0\"` vs `device=\"xpu\"` consistently across all the modified functions.\n\nWe'd be happy to review and merge XPU support once it's submitted as a PR. Thanks for taking the initiative to get this working!", "@glenn-jocher I am sitting behind a corporate proxy that makes any outside update difficult.  If someone makes the requested changes, I can always test it out with the hardware available to me. Will have to explore internally to see if update is possible.\n\nIn the trainer.py is this a good option? If not, I am seeing a warning, but no other issues. I don't know if xpu supports GradScaler, but the code doesn't produce warning or error. The below logic can avoid a warning for XPU case, but might work in future if it is supported.\n\nLine 290\n\n        if torch.cuda.is_available():\n            self.scaler = (\n                torch.amp.GradScaler(\"cuda\", enabled=self.amp) if TORCH_2_4 else torch.cuda.amp.GradScaler(enabled=self.amp)\n            )\n        elif torch.xpu.is_available():\n            self.scaler = (torch.amp.GradScaler(self.device, enabled=self.amp))\n\nThe select_device method in torch_utils.py needs modification. The variable device is used interchangeably making it difficult. If we give device=0, what does it mean. It could be a GPU or XPU. At present I am passing device=\"xpu\" which limits its usage to one card. There are machines with more than one card.\n\nThere could be a machine with CPU, iGPU, NPU, dGPU (NVIDIA), dGPU (Intel called XPU), dGPU (AMD), and ASIC (Intel HPU) all in one machine. Checking logic like torch.cuda.is_available() or torch.xpu.is_available() or torch.cpu.is_available() will all return true because they are present in the system. This could lead to issues like user specifying device=0 which defaults to CUDA even though user might have selected XPU based on how the workload is running. If the user has done YOLO('yolov8l.pt').to(DEVICE), the DEVICE should be honored across the workflow logic. With what changes are proposed above, setting device=\"xpu\" or device=\"xpu:0\" should work. Selecting device=\"0\" on a XPU machine fails because it defaults to CUDA when it is not available. Multicard training needs further study because theoretically it should be same for CUDA or XPU.", "Thanks for the detailed analysis @azhuvath! I completely understand the corporate proxy constraints - that's a common challenge.\n\nYour GradScaler approach looks good, though I'd suggest checking `self.device.type == \"xpu\"` instead of `torch.xpu.is_available()` to ensure you're actually using an XPU device rather than just having XPU capability available.\n\nYou raise excellent points about the device selection complexity in multi-accelerator systems. The current logic in `select_device` does assume CUDA priority, which isn't ideal for XPU workflows. Your approach of explicitly passing `device=\"xpu\"` is the right pattern for now - it's clear and unambiguous.\n\nSince you're unable to submit PRs directly, perhaps @huahuadeliaoliao could incorporate your working changes into their planned PR? Your attached files provide a solid foundation and the performance results (15x over CPU, 2.5x with AMP) are compelling evidence this implementation works well.\n\nFor multi-XPU support, the pattern should indeed be similar to multi-GPU - handling device strings like `\"xpu:0,1\"` in the device parsing logic, though that can be a follow-up enhancement once basic XPU support is merged.", "@glenn-jocher I tested the changes on Intel Meteor Lake (MTL) iGPU (Integrated Graphics). It is working fine. So it should also work on Intel Lunar Lake (LNL) iGPU. Since I have already tested on Max 1100, I am more or less confident that it should work on Intel Xe graphics which came out in the last 3 years for edge, client, and data center.

Fuzz testing MQE may help us uncover cases we've missed.\n\n### How will we do it (roughly)?\n\n@colega created a [PoC](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/pull/10575) that already uncovered [one issue](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/15969). We could build on this.\n\nhttps://github.com/cortexproject/promqlsmith might also be helpful here: it can generate a variety of random PromQL statements.\n\n### Size (development only)\n\nSmall (<= 1 month dev)\n\n### What are the documentation dependencies?\n\n(none)",

The core logic for assembling the answer changed in recent updates, specifically in the `_run` method of `answer_node.py`, which now processes and merges template/user text and LLM output differently. This likely causes the LLM output to appear outside your custom tags, leaving the tag empty instead of wrapping the LLM output as before [[source]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/blob/37e19de7ab3d8c1ffd8dfd8b789ff52b47f981cb/api/core/workflow/nodes/answer/answer_node.py).\n\nThere’s no documentation or open issue directly tracking this, but similar regressions have happened before when output formatting or merging logic was refactored. If you need a workaround, try adjusting your template or node configuration to see if you can force the LLM output inside the tag, or temporarily revert to 1.4.3 if that’s feasible for your deployment. If you’re using structured output, double-check your schema and model compatibility, as recent changes in structured output handling have also caused related issues for some users [[source]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/20975).\n\nIf you need to track this for a future fix, keep an eye on changes to `answer_node.py` and related workflow node logic in upcoming releases.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

I doubt if this will change the answer of my custom tag.", "<!-- Answer -->\nYou're correct—adding the ArrayFileSegment wrapper only affects how file outputs are handled and does not impact string outputs or the formatting of your custom tags in the answer node. The regression with your custom tag is more likely due to changes in how the answer node parses and merges templates and variables. Specifically, the answer is now assembled by splitting your template into text and variable chunks, then merging them, which can cause issues if the chunk boundaries don't align with your tags (for example, if you have a template like `<tag>{{#llm#}}</tag>`) [[source]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/blob/37e19de7ab3d8c1ffd8dfd8b789ff52b47f981cb/api/core/workflow/nodes/answer/answer_stream_generate_router.py).\n\nIf your tags are ending up empty, it's likely because the variable replacement logic is splitting the template in a way that separates the tag from the variable. This is unrelated to ArrayFileSegment and is instead a subtle change in the template parsing or merging logic. You might be able to work around this by adjusting your template so that the variable is not directly inside the tag, or by experimenting with different placements of your tags and variables. If you need to dig deeper, reviewing the logic in AnswerStreamGeneratorRouter and the template parsers (PromptTemplateParser, VariableTemplateParser) will show exactly how the chunks are split and merged.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

The frontend now uses a custom Rehype plugin that strips or alters any HTML tag that doesn't match the regex /^[a-z][a-z0-9]*$/i, converting it to plain text. This means custom tags (like `<tag>`) are no longer rendered as HTML elements, which is why your LLM output appears outside the tag or the tag appears empty in the UI, even though the backend (and debug panel) output is correct. This stricter sanitation was likely added for security reasons and is not documented as a breaking change, so it may not have been present or as strict in 1.4.3 [reference](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/blob/37e19de7ab3d8c1ffd8dfd8b789ff52b47f981cb/web/app/components/base/markdown/index.tsx).\n\nTo work around this, you can use only standard HTML tags supported by the renderer, or adjust your template to avoid custom tags.

      "description" : "### Brief Abstract\r\n(perhaps only when in a roam buffer), if `id` is selected as the link type in `org-insert-link`, offer completion over roam nodes (with `org-roam-node-read`) and insert a link to the relevant id.\r\n\r\n### Long Description\r\nI use org both with and without org-roam and I want a really easy, simple workflow. Basically, I *do* want completion on node names when I'm inserting links in roam buffers, but I *don't* want to have to remember that I'm in a roam buffer and therefore use a special keybinding for `org-roam-node-insert`. I just want to insert link with org and have it Just Work™.\r\n\r\nSo, like altering the link following behaviour (as roam [already does](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/blob/3782e88d50f83c5b9fbb4b10df71df3f37e27156/org-roam-id.el#L91)), set org's built-in completion to play nice with roam nodes.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Implementation (if any)\r\n```elisp\r\n(defun org-roam-id-complete (&optional initial-input filter-fn sort-fn require-match prompt)\r\n  \"Read an `org-roam-node', returning its id.\r\n\r\nAll args are passed to `org-roam-node-read'.\"\r\n  (concat\r\n   \"id:\"\r\n   (org-roam-node-id\r\n    (org-roam-node-read\r\n     initial-input filter-fn sort-fn require-match prompt))))\r\n\r\n(org-link-set-parameters \"id\" :complete #'org-roam-id-complete)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWould go [here](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/blob/3782e88d50f83c5b9fbb4b10df71df3f37e27156/org-roam-id.el#L92). I included passing the optional args incase this function is useful in other lisp in the future.\r\n\r\nThis could be augmented with a check of `org-roam-buffer-p` if we wanted to avoid linking outside of roam buffers. I'm not sure if this is relevant, because org doesn't have a default completion mechanism for `id` links, so this implementation doesn't shadow anything.\r\n\r\n(edit to add: happy to PR this if anyone thinks it's worth it)\r\n\r\n#### Possible extensions\r\nIt would be nice to set the title of the node as the default/suggested description for the link, but this doesn't seem possible in a way which doesn't have to account for every link type at once (see [here](https://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/27860/34394) and the docstring of `org-link-make-description-function`).\r\n\r\nFailing that, it might be a good idea to add the title to the history (or future history) of the relevant list, so that it can be easily pulled down as a description. This should be easy enough in the above function with `add-to-history`, but I don't know which list to add to. I could make the change work if I did though!\r\n\r\n### Please check the following:\r\n\r\n- [X] No similar feature requests\r\n",

      "description" : "### Is there an existing issue already for this feature request/idea?\n\n- [x] I have searched for an existing issue, and could not find anything. I believe this is a new feature request to be evaluated.\n\n### What problem is this feature going to solve? Why should it be added?\n\nImporting a db with pg_dump using a single worker is slow. There is also no easy hook for the `SELECT timescaledb_pre_restore();` and `SELECT timescaledb_post_restore();` functions.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nA common pattern is to split the job into pgdumps predata, data, and postdata stages. You generally want to use a single worker when copying the schema, many workers when copying the actual data, and at least one worker when applying constraints at the end depending on how fast that is. The current extra settings flag does not give you the control to do this.\n\nI'm willing to work on this feature. Looking at the existing codebase, this does look like a good first issue assuming prior experience with pg_dump, since the import section is fairly self-contained.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nRunning a shell script by piping to kubectl exec sh). This is pretty close to what we do now, since pg_dump/pg_restore is fairly independent of how it runs.\n\nOther options would be to have a CNPG-I plugin for other restore options like pgcopydb. Another is to not bother with any optimizations but to add six lines to  detect whether timescaledb is a preloaded extension and if so to run the  `SELECT timescaledb_pre_restore();` and `SELECT timescaledb_post_restore();` functions which are required to load the backup correctly, with no API changes and only a fix to import databases with a common extension.\n\n### Additional context\n\nExposing a good API for this is tricky and this is something I'd like a maintainer opinion on. \n\n### Backport?\n\nNo\n\n### Are you willing to actively contribute to this feature?\n\nYes\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct",
