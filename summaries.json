It should also be able to accomplish this without needing a whole lot of rigging to support.\n\nI don't utilize multiple displays, and I know @dhh doesn't either so it will likely require someone to pick up the torch on this one who does so we can ensure it's properly tested but also just have the motivation to tackle it.",

I don't use multi-monitors so i can't say which of these tools is the best, but i'd use the one that works best. Imagine quickly having to do monitor stuff and you have to fiddle around with some inferior tool, just because it's \"less heavy\" or fits the \"vibe\" more :P.", "I've been running hyprmon on my desktop system that has 2-3 monitors depeding on the day. Have been very happy with it. Simple and easy to use TUI tool. Haven't tried modifying it or anything, just using it as is out of the box. It does pretty much everything I need: positioning the monitors, toggling them on/off when needed, orientation, etc. Provides hotkey tooltips visible while operating the tool so you don't have to remember everything by heart.\n\nBy default it seems to place configurations in user/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf, which don't seem to interfere with the default one in .../monitors.conf.\n\nI can look into these other candidates to compare the options and dive deeper into hyprmon as well.", "The one I think is most intriguing in the list is honestly hyprdynamicmonitors. It does a lot, and does it better in my opinion and surface-level review than nwg-displays. \n\nThe other item is has is \"Event-driven architecture responding to monitor, power and lid state changes in real-time\" which could solve an issue we have a few open items about like https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy/issues/797 and folks have tried to build workarounds for.\n\nIf this could solve for that and make configurations easier for users; that's a bit win.", "hyprdynamicmonitors indeed looks capable and usable. I can give it a test drive usability wise next week running a few different monitor setups.", "I???ve been using nwg-displays ??? it???s lightweight, fast, and works seamlessly.", "After trying hyprmon, hyprdynamicmonitors and nwg-displays it feels like the clear winner is hyprmon. nwg-displays works well and exposes all the monitor related features you'd like to configure but does this sort of GUI app fit the \"vibe\" as the OP says?\n\nhyprdynamicmonitors has a pretty nice TUI but did not feel as intuitive or simple as hyprmon. It also has a \"bug\" (at least for me) where the monitor layout preview starts at 0,0 rather than the center of where your monitors are actually positioned, so I couldn't even see my third monitor until I panned the entire grid over. I also don't think it allows for as much configuration as hyprmon (it may be there as I could have missed it). hyprdynamicmonitors also seems to give a lot of nice extra feature related to power and lid states but I'm on a desktop and was unable to test. Personally, I think the display config feature should be kept to just that.\n\nIn the end, hyprmon gives all the monitor functionality you'd want, has a nice TUI and a bonus extra feature of saving profiles which you can load/apply or set with a hotkey. This is useful for scenarios where you have different monitors configured at home, work, presentation, etc.", "I have only used hyprmon for dual monitor setup and it works well. \nNow how about bringing up whatever tool chosen with right click on the background through a contextual menu?" ],

To confirm: The _default_ value of `asynchronous` is `true`. Did you only comment out the\n`asynchronous: true,`\npart, od did you explicitly change this to\n`asynchronous: false,`\n? I checked the latter, and that worked for me...\n", "> Did you only comment out the `asynchronous: true`\n\nGood catch @javagl, that is what I did. `asynchronous: false` lets it run through without error.\n\nOne thing I noticed looking through existing Sandcastles: I don't think we ever actually supply a `Geometry` to the `GeometryInstance` constructor, even though this is allowed [according to the doc](https://cesium.com/learn/cesiumjs/ref-doc/GeometryInstance.html). Every example that I could find is instead supplying an implementation of the (poorly documented) `GeometryFactor` interface.\n\nPerhaps this is why the bug hasn't been noticed already.", "I think we should categorize this as a docs issue: the `GeometryInstance` constructor should require a `GeometryFactory` rather than a `Geometry`." ],

      "url" : "https://github.com/nodejs/userland-migrations/issues/127",
      "repositoryName" : "nodejs/userland-migrations",
      "description" : "## Description\n\nSince `tls.createSecurePair()` is deprecated (DEP0064) and has reached End-of-Life status, we should provide a codemod to replace it.\n\n- The codemod should replace all instances of `tls.createSecurePair()` with `tls.Socket` constructor or appropriate `tls.connect()` usage.\n- The codemod should update the implementation to use the modern TLS socket API instead of the deprecated secure pair approach.\n- If `tls.createSecurePair` is the only TLS function being used from a destructured import, the codemod should update the import to include the replacement methods.\n- The codemod should handle different usage patterns and provide appropriate replacements based on context.\n\n## Additional Information\n\nNote that `tls.createSecurePair()` was removed in Node.js v24.0.0 and users should use `tls.Socket` instead. The `createSecurePair()` API was deprecated because it was an older, less secure approach to creating TLS connections. The modern `tls.Socket` provides better security, performance, and API consistency.\n\nThe `tls.createSecurePair()` method created a pair of streams (cleartext and encrypted) for TLS communication, but this pattern has been superseded by the more straightforward `tls.Socket` approach which handles the encryption transparently.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Case 1: Basic createSecurePair usage\n\n**Before:**\n```js\nconst { createSecurePair } = require('node:tls');\n\nconst pair = createSecurePair(credentials);\n```\n\n**After:**\n```js\nconst { TLSSocket } = require('node:tls');\n\nconst socket = new TLSSocket(underlyingSocket, { secureContext: credentials });\n```\n\n### Case 2: Namespace import\n\n**Before:**\n```js\nconst tls = require('node:tls');\n\nconst pair = tls.createSecurePair(credentials);\n```\n\n**After:**\n```js\nconst tls = require('node:tls');\n\nconst socket = new tls.TLSSocket(underlyingSocket, { secureContext: credentials });\n```\n\n### Case 3: With server context\n\n**Before:**\n```js\nconst { createSecurePair } = require('node:tls');\n\nconst pair = createSecurePair(credentials, true, true, false);\n```\n\n**After:**\n```js\nconst { TLSSocket } = require('node:tls');\n\nconst socket = new TLSSocket(underlyingSocket, { \n  secureContext: credentials, \n  isServer: true, \n  requestCert: true, \n  rejectUnauthorized: false \n});\n```\n\n### Case 4: ESM import\n\n**Before:**\n```js\nimport { createSecurePair } from 'node:tls';\n\nconst pair = createSecurePair(credentials);\n```\n\n**After:**\n```js\nimport { TLSSocket } from 'node:tls';\n\nconst socket = new TLSSocket(underlyingSocket, { secureContext: credentials });\n```\n\n### Case 5: ESM namespace import\n\n**Before:**\n```js\nimport * as tls from 'node:tls';\n\nconst pair = tls.createSecurePair(credentials);\n```\n\n**After:**\n```js\nimport * as tls from 'node:tls';\n\nconst socket = new tls.TLSSocket(underlyingSocket, { secureContext: credentials });\n```\n\n### Case 6: Mixed usage with other TLS functions\n\n**Before:**\n```js\nconst { createSecurePair, createServer } = require('node:tls');\n\nconst pair = createSecurePair(credentials);\nconst server = createServer(options);\n```\n\n**After:**\n```js\nconst { TLSSocket, createServer } = require('node:tls');\n\nconst socket = new TLSSocket(underlyingSocket, { secureContext: credentials });\nconst server = createServer(options);\n```\n\n## Refs\n\n- [DEP0064: `tls.createSecurePair()`](https://nodejs.org/api/deprecations.html#dep0064-tlscreatesecurepair)",

      "description" : "# Some Background\n\nRegarding data types / schemas, there're multiple forms:\n\n1. Python native type annotation, e.g. `int`, `dict[str, Any]`, a specific data class. They're directly used in users code as type hints.\n2. [`AnalyzedTypeInfo`](https://github.com/cocoindex-io/cocoindex/blob/d064c52ce8f3b5cf93d21f5a6213d09c8b0ee18f/python/cocoindex/typing.py#L237-L249): basically a more structured representation of 1. Used by our Python SDK internally only.\n3. Strong-typed schema representing in CocoIndex's type system, [these classes](https://github.com/cocoindex-io/cocoindex/blob/d064c52ce8f3b5cf93d21f5a6213d09c8b0ee18f/python/cocoindex/typing.py#L514-L693), they mirror engine's data schema representation. They're exposed to some third party APIs, e.g. custom targets (custom target connectors can inspect schema of the data exporting to them), and also custom functions / sources in the future.\n4. Generic-typed JSON-equivalent values, in types such as `dict[str, Any]` (for JSON object), `list[dict[str, Any]]` (for JSON array), `str` (for JSON string), etc. They can be directly passed from/to engine in Rust.\n\n# Task\n\nWe have logic to convert Python's native type annotation to engine type. Currently we're doing 1->2->4 ([code](https://github.com/cocoindex-io/cocoindex/blob/d064c52ce8f3b5cf93d21f5a6213d09c8b0ee18f/python/cocoindex/typing.py#L357-L502)), because 3 was just introduced recently.\n\nWe want to:\n- Change the logic of 2->4 to 2->3, i.e. convert `AnalyzedTypeInfo` to strong-typed schema representation first. This will make our code easier to read and maintain  (3 is easier to build than 4, and can leverage mypy type checks etc.)\n- After got 3, existing callers can simply call the `encode()` method to get 4. So we don't have to expose convenient methods to directly return 4 in the `typing` package.\n- Tests in [`test_typing.py`](https://github.com/cocoindex-io/cocoindex/blob/main/python/cocoindex/tests/test_typing.py) should be updated accordingly, to check the output of 3 instead of 4 (3 is more structured than 4, and easier to check).\n\n",

Yes, we're also aware of the limitations of the type bindings - mostly because we need our data to be serializable, so currently we use disciplined type systems and not all Python object can be directly used (we have similar constraints as a database).\n\nThis feature request doesn't help much for this (it allows type representation in CocoIndex engine more easily accessed by Python, but doesn't allow CocoIndex engine to handle more types with more flexibility).\n\nI created a separate issue #1144 to address this problem. Will have more discussions over there.\n\n", "unassigned the issue since there's no more activity", "Can I work in this issue?", "@Aterg264 thanks for taking this!

You can find the file at:\nhttps://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions/blob/main/docs/translations/README.ar.md\n\n**What needs to be changed:**\n- Find all code blocks that contain shell commands (git commands, terminal commands)\n- Change \"\\`\\`\\`\" to \"\\`\\`\\`bash\" for these blocks\n- Keep other code blocks (like HTML, CSS, etc.) with their appropriate language specifications\n\n**Example of what needs to be fixed:**\n\nCurrently without language specification\n    \\`\\`\\`\n    git clone git@github.com:this-is-you/first-contributions.git\n    \\`\\`\\`\n\n Should be (with bash language specification)\n    \\`\\`\\`bash\n    git clone git@github.com:this-is-you/first-contributions.git\n    \\`\\`\\`\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Please only address one issue in a PR.\n> Let's make it possible for more people to solve issues here.\n\n\uD83D\uDCCB  **Steps to solve the problem**\n\n*   Comment below about what you've started working on.\n*   Find all code blocks in the Arabic README that contain shell/git commands\n*   Add `bash` language specification to these code blocks\n*   Ensure syntax highlighting works properly\n*   Add, commit, push your changes.\n*   Submit a pull request and add this in comments - 'Resolves #<put issue number here>'\n*   Ask for reviews in comments section of pull request.\n*   Celebrate your contribution to this project. \uD83C\uDF89\n    ",

I am not sure this is intended or already discussed, but seems curious.\r\n\r\nAs investigating in construction process, `pd.array` pass dtype as is (str) but `pd.Sereis` call (via `lib.ensure_string_array`) dtype as \"object\"\r\n  \r\n### using `pd.array` \r\n```python\r\n# https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/v2.2.1/pandas/core/arrays/numpy_.py#L127\r\nresult = np.asarray(scalars, dtype=dtype)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### using `pd.Sereis`\r\n```python\r\n# https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/v2.2.1/pandas/core/construction.py#L800-L802\r\n# lib.ensure_string_array(arr, convert_na_value=False, copy=copy).reshape(shape)\r\n# https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/v2.2.1/pandas/_libs/lib.pyx#L766\r\nresult = np.asarray(arr, dtype=\"object\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nAlthough there might be historical reasons behind this divergent behavior, striving for consistency between pd.array and pd.Series for dtype=str would be more intuitive.\r\n\r\n### Installed Versions\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n/tmp/pandas-report/.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/_distutils_hack/__init__.py:33: UserWarning: Setuptools is replacing distutils.\r\n  warnings.warn(\"Setuptools is replacing distutils.\")\r\n\r\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\r\n------------------\r\ncommit                : bdc79c146c2e32f2cab629be240f01658cfb6cc2\r\npython                : 3.11.6.final.0\r\npython-bits           : 64\r\nOS                    : Linux\r\nOS-release            : 5.15.133.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2\r\nVersion               : #1 SMP Thu Oct 5 21:02:42 UTC 2023\r\nmachine               : x86_64\r\nprocessor             : x86_64\r\nbyteorder             : little\r\nLC_ALL                : None\r\nLANG                  : C.UTF-8\r\nLOCALE                : en_US.UTF-8\r\n\r\npandas                : 2.2.1\r\nnumpy                 : 1.26.4\r\npytz                  : 2024.1\r\ndateutil              : 2.8.2\r\nsetuptools            : 65.5.0\r\npip                   : 23.2.1\r\nCython                : None\r\npytest                : None\r\nhypothesis            : None\r\nsphinx                : None\r\nblosc                 : None\r\nfeather               : None\r\nxlsxwriter            : None\r\nlxml.etree            : None\r\nhtml5lib              : None\r\npymysql               : None\r\npsycopg2              : None\r\njinja2                : 3.1.3\r\nIPython               : 8.22.1\r\npandas_datareader     : None\r\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\r\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\r\nbs4                   : None\r\nbottleneck            : None\r\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\r\nfastparquet           : None\r\nfsspec                : 2024.2.0\r\ngcsfs                 : 2024.2.0\r\nmatplotlib            : None\r\nnumba                 : None\r\nnumexpr               : None\r\nodfpy                 : None\r\nopenpyxl              : None\r\npandas_gbq            : None\r\npyarrow               : 15.0.0\r\npyreadstat            : None\r\npython-calamine       : None\r\npyxlsb                : None\r\ns3fs                  : None\r\nscipy                 : None\r\nsqlalchemy            : 2.0.27\r\ntables                : None\r\ntabulate              : None\r\nxarray                : None\r\nxlrd                  : None\r\nzstandard             : None\r\ntzdata                : 2024.1\r\nqtpy                  : None\r\npyqt5                 : None\r\n</details>\r\n",

      "description" : "### Context\nAs a first step to improving GenAI code style, basic checks defined in the project's pre-commit configuration should be run.\n\n### What needs to be done?\n1. Run 3 checks from https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/model_api/blob/66384b0b747dee0fb3e37c6466115b7e60da3a10/.github/workflows/test_precommit.yml#L12-L16. Configure `pre-commit` python module to also `check-merge-conflict` and `check-json`. Python (e.g., `black --check .`) and C++ specific checks are out of scope. A good example is in https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino.genai/pull/1453: https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino.genai/blob/33f87c15980ef4296a7dd1f7775c27f622db8f86/.pre-commit-config.yaml.\n2. Fix detected issues. Some files are expected to fail. For example ??? is an expected non ASCII symbol in root README.md. `src/python/openvino_genai/py_openvino_genai.pyi` should also be excluded because it's an automatically generated file. It should be regenerated by compiling the project and added to your commit. Exclude such files from testing.\n3. Add a new job within the GitHub Actions workflow to https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino.genai/blob/master/.github/workflows/causal_lm_cpp.yml to run these three checks.\n4. Submit a pull request (PR).\n\n### Example Pull Request\nhttps://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino.genai/pull/315\n\n### Resources\n- [Contribution guide - start here!](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n- [Intel DevHub Discord channel](https://discord.gg/7pVRxUwdWG) - engage in discussions, ask questions and talk to OpenVINO developers\n\n### Contact points\n@Wovchena",

Which is fine, the author is just being more precise by pasting in the exact version they used, but someone who only has some version of 8.0.x installed who then uses 8.0 as the upper bound on `requires_php` probably does want to see 8.0.15 in there too, since the case of a plugin requiring a fix that exists only after a particular patch release of PHP should be vanishingly small.\n\nI don't see the same issue for `tested` though since it's only useful as a lower bound.  But we should probably support a syntax for ranges, either with keys like `tested_ge`, `requires_php_eq`, and so on, or by taking two numbers as an inclusive range, e.g. `requires_php=7.4,8.3`.

Open a window, and note that there is a teeny tiny gap between the windows content and the border\n\n## What's wrong here?\nI am setting the radius of the border to the same thing as the radius of the content. However, this is wrong. The radius of the border _should_ be larger because that radius is being applied to a larger rectangle. Hence, we will need a larger radius there to make up for it. The solution won't be much code, but it is a bit of thinking to get the maths right. This is a good issue for anyone who likes geometry and signed distance fields :)",

The [textual pass pipeline](https://mlir.llvm.org/docs/PassManagement/#textual-pass-pipeline-specification) specification `--pass-pipeline=...` is neat (it does give you more control), but it is also more verbose, especially because you have to include the nesting structure on the which the pass should be applied." ],

This is problematic when trying to create more airdrop transactions - it is difficult to understand what we have.\n\n## \uD83D\uDCA1 Solution\nRename files so airdrop transactions are grouped together now and in the future\n\nfor example we have:\nexamples/token_cancel_airdrop.py \nexamples/token_airdrop.py\n\ninstead: it would be easier if they were\nexamples/token_airdrop_cancel.py \nexamples/token_airdrop.py\n\n\nsrc/hiero_sdk_python/tokens/token_cancel_airdrop_transaction.py\ninstead:\nsrc/hiero_sdk_python/tokens/token_airdrop_cancel_transaction.py\nNOTE: this one is a breaking change because it changes imports.\nOnce this is renamed, we need to add backwards compatibility, allowing users to still use their old import file name but tell them its deprecated and will be removed in a future release, please use src/hiero_sdk_python/tokens/token_airdrop_cancel_transaction.py\n\ntests/unit/test_pending_airdrop_id.py\ntests/unit/test_pending_airdrop_record.py\n\nshould be:\ntests/unit/test_airdrop_pending_id.py\ntests/unit/test_airdrop_pending_record.py\n\n### \uD83D\uDC69???\uD83D\uDCBB Implementation\n- [ ] rename un-grouped airdrop files\n- [ ] add backward compatibility to the src/hiero_sdk_python/token file name changes\n\n### \uD83D\uDC69???\uD83D\uDCBB Requirements to Pass\n- [ ] All tests pass\n- [ ] Breaking change is backward compatible and documented under 'UNRELEASED' and breaking change section.\n- [ ] Rest of the changes has descriptive changelog.md addition to 'UNRELEASED' \ne.g.\n\"chore: refactored examples/topic_message_submit.py to be more modular\"\n***NOTE***: ensure your branch is always up to date with upstream main !!\n- [ ] Verified commits achieved (see CONTRIBUTING.md and docs/sdk_developers/signing.md)\n\n***IMPORTANT*** Your pull request CANNOT BE MERGED until you add a changelog entry AND sign your commits each with \"git commit -S -s -m \"chore: your commit message\"\" and a GPG key***\n\n### Next steps\n  - [ ] Comment below that you???d like to work on this issue.\n  - [ ] Wait to be assigned by a maintainer.\n  - [ ] Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-python/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n to start forking and developing.\n\n\nIf you have never contributed to an open source project at GitHub, the following step-by-step guide will introduce you to the workflow.\n\n[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-python/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n[README.md](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-python/blob/main/README.md)",

There are a number of Ruby version managers out there on Linux, such as `rvm`, `rbenv`, `asdf`, `mise`, `chruby`. Then there's `homebrew` (particularly on Mac), or `rv` coming along (and already able to do the basics of installing many recent versions). On Windows, the situation's a mess, needing manual installation.\n\nWhat I've currently implemented ignores adding new versions, and instead looks in `$PATH` (potentially finding more than one Ruby version), then also hunts through standard locations. On Windows it could either rummage through the registry, or use the `ridk` tool???but at the moment it's `%PATH%` only (again, capable of handling multiple versions). If no suitable Ruby is found, it just prompts the user, suggesting a suitable command if they have a manager installed.\n\nDoes that sound of use? Or should I cut back the hunting and prompting, and/or is it necessary to implement some form of downloader?\n\nMy team need to be able to run the `rubocop` hook on Windows, so I can hopefully get them to test 'real' use, although running the test suite may be harder. I've been successfully running this on Linux. The tests will need a bit more work before a PR, and I'll want to work out the coverage and bloat details too.", "It's fine to leave out the downloader - we can always add it later." ],

Content will be downloaded dynamically, depending on the programming languages used.\nSpecificially, language servers and their dependencies are downloaded. You will, for the most part, find the downloaded content in ~/.serena/language_servers and could explicitly provide, in your container, the conent required for the set of languages you want to support.\n\n> I don't know which those are and it might also break in a later version\n\nFuture versions of Serena may update the language server dependencies, so you will always have to provide a package that is specific to a particular version of Serena.\n\n> Another alternative would be to create a few language specific fake project just for the sake of downloading the dependecies. \n\nThis is a reasonable workaround.\nOne thing we could do to facilitate this is to provide a command line tool like `serena download-ls <language>`. It would be a fairly simple addition.", "The `download-ls` would be super helpful. That's almost all I need.", "We would accept a PR on that. There already exist useful abstractions, like `RuntimeDependencyCollection` which are used in most (if not all) LS implementations. Most LS implementations also have a private method like `_setup_runtime_dependencies`.\n\nThis issue would be addressed by making the download mechanism public, i.e. add a classmethod `download_runtime_dependencies(solidlsp_settings)` to the LS base class and consistently use `RuntimeDependencyCollection` there.\n\nFinally, this functionality should be exposed via `download-ls-dependencies` in the serena CLI.\n\nGood issue for the community", "can i work on this?", "@giovanimds sure, you're the first to volunteer for it :)" ],

Please don't hesitate to let us know if you need to clarify any concerns. Good luck ??? ", "Hi @pavinduLakshan \n\nI???m working on this issue but got stuck at tracing where the unwanted roles listing API call \n(GET /scim2/v2/Roles?excludedAttributes=...) is triggered when viewing a single role. \nCould you point me to the relevant frontend files or give a hint on how to fix this? \n\nThanks \uD83D\uDE42", "Hi @asifa-23,\n\nAs per the screencast attached in the issue description, you can see that role list call is being triggered when the user is navigating to the edit view of an individual role. \n\nTo find out the source code for this role edit view can be challenging, especially for a beginner. Even experienced engineers familiar with the codebase face this difficulty sometimes. \n\nA foolproof way to locate the component is to search for a distinct text in the view you want to locate the source code for. In this case, you will see that the text \"can be used within the organization\" is distinctively used in the role edit view. These text strings are usually maintained in modules/i18n as JS objects and the i18n keys are used in the source code to render the strings in the UI. From the search results, you will be able to get an idea of the i18n key structure.\n\nFor example, in our case, you will be able to locate the following. And as per the object structure, the i18n key ends with `managedOrg.label`. So now you can again search the codebase for the usage of this i18n key phrase. \n\n<img width=\"540\" height=\"107\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36d16376-802d-422c-a755-efd3daaaad1d\" />\n\n If there are multiple usages, try to temporarily remove the code and see whether that change is reflected in the console app (You should do this after starting the console app in development mode against a running WSO2 Identity server instance.). Once you pinpoint the correct component, you can continue debugging the root cause for triggering a roles list call in the role edit view.\n\nHope this helps. If there's still anything needs to be clarified, please don't hesitate to get back.\n\nBest regards\nPavindu", "@asifa-23 Do you have any further update on this issue?

I really learned a lot while working on it!  \nI???d love to contribute again once I get a better understanding of APIs and the codebase. \n", "@asifa-23 Thanks for the update, and congratulations on taking your first step toward open-source contribution. Although we may not be able to recognize your contribution under the Hacktoberfest 2025 program, I encourage you to fix the issue and submit a PR whenever possible.

      "description" : "### Problem\nThe documentation defines the concept of _heading_ for 2D vectors specifically.\n\n* In 1.x, there are no true 2D vectors, in that `z` is always defined. As a result, `heading()` produces output for fully 3D vectors, even when `z` is nonzero. It also produces output for ???1D??? vectors, since `createVector(1)` could be used as a shortcut for `createVector(1, 0)`.  \n* In 2.x, we have an opportunity to resolve these unintended quirks.\n\n### Solution\nSupporting only 2D input and adding errors for other dimensions would allow the simplest and clearest feature specification, and it???s how users expect this feature to be used. This could be considered a bug fix: users who accidentally provide a 3D vector can now be notified of this mistake, rather than silently allowing it. In practice, it appears that this change would cause zero (or near zero) disruption.\n\n### Disruption estimate: 0%\nI used the Google search phrase `site:https://editor.p5js.org/ \"createVector\" \"heading\"` to find 50 sketches using the `heading()` method. Zero of them would break if we were to implement the proposed solution.\n\n(I did exclude a few sketches, meaning I didn???t count them toward the numerator or denominator. One case used 4D vectors in 1.x, which is not supported, and the sketch appeared to be broken already. I also excluded three sketches that used `createVector()` with zero arguments somewhere in their heading calculations, since it???s not 100% clear what effect this will have in 2.x. But [the goal is to prevent errors](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/issues/8156#issuecomment-3429392581) from arising in this case.)\n\n### Blocking issues (foundational issues for all of `p5.Vector`)\nIf you're interested in helping to move the current issue along, you can add a comment on the current issue to indicate whether you support the proposed solution. After that, you could add a comment on the following issues to indicate whether you support the proposals they contain, along with a brief rationale.\n\n* [#8153](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/issues/8153): Consensus would clarify the meaning of 2D. In 1.x, this meant $z=0$, but according to the proposal, in 2.x it'd mean the vector has exactly two defined elements (this would resolve an inconsistency with the current implementations of `.z` and `toString()`).\n* [#8155](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/issues/8155): Consensus on a user-facing API for checking dimension size would enable a more stable implementation of `heading()`. Adding a comment on the current leading proposal (`.shape`), either in support of the proposal or against it, would be helpful. The exact format of this API depends on the outcome of an ongoing review of getter/setter patterns in p5, so any comments can focus on the \"shape\" concept.",

This conforms to the documented definition of ???heading??? as an angle in the $xy$-plane, and fixes a quirk of the 1.x feature.

      "comments" : [ "I agree that restricting setHeading() to 2D vectors is the most straightforward and consistent solution for 2.x. i was thinking it might be useful if we keep the current behavior strict (only 2D vectors allowed by default, with a clear error message) and optionally, allow an extra parameter like setHeading(angle, plane) so advanced users can specify which plane (\"xy\", \"xz\", \"yz\", or [0,2]) to rotate within for ndimensional vectors.", "Hi @GregStanton, I would like to work on this. Can you please assign this issue to me?", "Thanks @Homaid! I appreciate you sharing your thoughts about the proposed solution. Regarding rotation in other planes, I'm really glad you mentioned this! It's an interesting idea. I actually just published a proposal to support this in the `rotate()` function (see #8218). That might be a good place to offer the functionality you described, since it's necessary for consistency with [the standalone `rotate()` function](https://beta.p5js.org/reference/p5/rotate/) anyway, and it'd allow us to continue documenting the \"heading\" concept in the simplest way possible: it's the angle a vector makes with the positive $x$-axis, measured clockwise.", "Hi @reshma045! Thank you so much for offering to help. I'd like to assign this issue to you, but I should make a couple notes first.\n\nFirst, there's an ongoing discussion about supporting true 1D/2D vectors in 2.x. For example, there's currently a PR ([#8203](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/pull/8203)) that would block this, but it hasn't been approved just yet, and the options are being discussed. This proposal assumes the existence of true 1D/2D vectors (i.e. a true 1D vector has exactly one element, rather than having $y$ and $z$ elements equal to zero).\n\nSecond, the related `heading()` issue contains a proposal that still needs to be approved, since that contains a breaking change, although evidence suggests it wouldn't break anyone's code in practice.\n\nAlthough you volunteered just before @justAnotherAnotherUser on the `heading()` issue, they [had already offered to help](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/issues/8158#issuecomment-3444217895) previously, and had been patiently waiting for me to post the sub-issue. Since these two issues are closely related, it might make sense for one person to tackle both, but would the two of you be interested to collaborate, perhaps by reviewing each other's PRs? That might be ideal. In that case, I can assign this `setHeading()` issue to @reshma045 and the `heading()` issue to @justAnotherAnotherUser.\n\nIf that sounds good, then we can talk about next steps. The first thing would be to comment on the blocking issues, if you haven't already, as noted in the top of this issue. Thanks again to you both!" ],

      "description" : "\n\uD83D\uDC7E Description of the issue\n\nThe Hiero SDK cannot un-pause tokens.\n\nThe TokenUnpauseTransaction is a key feature of the Hedera Token Service that allows to unpause tokens. This functionality should be implemented in the Python SDK .\n\n\uD83D\uDC7E Solution \n\nThe TokenUnpauseTransaction should be implemented, together with its example, its unit and integration tests.\n\nTo solve this, first review the documentation for it:\n- [Python Protobufs - TokenUnpauseTransaction](https://github.com/nadineloepfe/hedera_sdk_python/blob/main/src/proto/token_unpause_pb2.py)\n- [Hedera Protobufs - TokenUnpauseTransaction](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-protobufs/blob/main/services/token_unpause.proto)\n[Hedera Docs - Unpause A Token](https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/sdks-and-apis/sdks/token-service/unpause-a-token)\n\nReview a good example that is similar:\n- [TokenPauseTransaction](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-python/blob/main/src/hiero_sdk_python/tokens/token_pause_transaction.py)\n- examples/token_pause.py\n- tests/unit/test_token_pause_transaction.py\n- tests/integration/token_pause_transaction_e2e_test.py\n\nor more recent examples following more recent workflows:\n- tests/unit/test_transfer_transaction.py\n- tests/integration/transfer_transaction_e2e_test.py\n\n\uD83D\uDD11 Key requirements:\n- [ ] Create src/hiero_sdk_python/tokens/token_unpause_transaction.py\nIt should:\n- [ ] Initialize\n- [ ] Set\n- [ ] build the proto body\n- [ ] build the transaction body\n- [ ] build the scheduled body\n- [ ] get method\n- [ ] from proto method\nfine-tuned to follow the hedera protobufs validation rules for token unpause transaction\n- [Hedera Protobufs - TokenUnpauseTransaction](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-protobufs/blob/main/services/token_unpause.proto)\n- you can find the generated python protobufs at src/hiero_sdk_python/hapi/services/token_unpause_pb2.py once you follow steps to generate proto in README.md\n\n- [ ] Write an example that can be run successfully using the hedera testnet, similar to our other examples. Ensure the functions are modular and can be called in a final end e.g. main function.\n- [ ] Write unit tests to validate the implementation and place them in the [/tests/unit]\n- [ ] Write integration tests to validate the implementation and place them in the [/tests/integration]\nPlease read our [testing guide](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-python/blob/main/docs/sdk_developers/testing.md)\n- [ ] Extend running_examples.md with a brief summary of how to run token un pause docs/sdk_users/running_examples.md\n \nAcceptance Criteria:\n- [ ] example\n- [ ] token unpause transaction class\n- [ ] unit test\n- [ ] integration test\n- [ ] running_examples documented\n- [ ] All tests pass\n- [ ] Nothing else changes\n- [ ] /CHANGELOG.md has an entry under 'UNRELEASED' under a relevant section. (Read docs/sdk_developers/changelog_entry.md for guidance).\n- [ ] ALL commits are DCO signed and marked as verified (see docs/sdk_developers/signing.md)\n\nBest Practices:\n- [ ] Keep your main an updated copy of the upstream main\n- [ ] Create a branch to solve your issue\n- [ ] Regularly fetch changes from the upstream main\n- [ ] NEVER EVER GIT MERGE FROM MAIN, please use: git rebase main -S (see our docs/sdk_developers/rebasing.md) if you need to apply upstream changes. If you face conflicts, read docs/sdk_developers/merge_conflicts.md\n- [ ] -s and -S sign each and every commit, you must use the terminal/CLI\n\n***IMPORTANT*** Your pull request CANNOT BE MERGED until you add a changelog entry AND sign your commits each with \"git commit -S -s -m \"chore: your commit message\"\" which is tied to a GPG key on github (read signing.md)***\n\n### Next steps\n  - [ ] Comment below that you???d like to work on this issue.\n  - [ ] Wait to be assigned by a maintainer.\n  - [ ] Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-python/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n to start forking and developing.\n\nThese guides will introduce you to our recommended workflow:\n[README.md](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-python/blob/main/README.md)\n\n[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-python/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\nWe also have a helpful docs archives at: /docs/sdk_developers \nhttps://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-python/tree/main/docs/sdk_developers\n\nand further information on signing here\nhttps://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-python/blob/main/docs/sdk_developers/signing.md\n\n\uD83E\uDD14 Additional Information\n\nIf you have any questions, just ask us directly in this issue by adding a comment.

Without a matchid, it will be needed that the process reading the records will search again if the line contains one of the annotations (or any other symbol: field, method, etc) searched to have a match `found`. Using a `matchId` associated with the initial query (= what finally execute the mvn cmd) simplifies the process to read the records and reports or not that we have a match found if the matchId's query is the same as the one of the record\n- As an annotation can appear several times within a class (example: GetMapping, PathVariable), then the same matchID can appear several times. Until now we can assume that if we have at least one record to report `match=found`. We can improve later how the information is reported here to include as this is the case with a language server the location (position, etc) of the `symbol` discovered within a java file, etc\n- A convention should be also adopted and defined to allow to easily pickup the correct CSV file from the generated folders. Example if the recipe class name is `FindAnnotations` then we could use as DataTable class name `AnnotationsReport` to find the CSV file => `rewrite/datatables/DATE_TIME/<ROOT_PACKAGE_NAME>.<TYPE_SEARCHED>.search.AnnotationsReport.csv`", "If the recipe datatable supports a matchId, then we could when we match/reconcile the information shows such a table result \n```\n=== Code Analysis Results (Improved Formatting)

the detailed explanation; I think in this case your needs are starting to diverge quite a bit from what we originally built our search recipes for: in our case they are meant to add informational search markers which we show in our UI (or failing that print into source files), whereas you're looking to do a wide search and build a report on what was found. Some of the features you've described above like match ID and line number aren't supported at the moment, and would be quite a substantial set of changes for one specific use case.\n\nOn the other hand I do feel as if what you're looking for can be achieved with a handful of custom search recipes that you maintain yourself, as opposed to us adopting those changes into all our search recipes. You could fork the search recipes that we have to add your common data table as desired, and then build your reports based on that.\n\nSeparately from our side we'll continue to aim for code changes in relation to the switch from Spring to Quarkus, as \nalready seen in https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite-spring-to-quarkus/. Both can approaches can be developed in parallel and complementary. I know the liberty team at IBM has similarly built tooling with a focus on building reports, which can then optionally suggest recipes to make changes based on the findings.\n\nCould that be a way forward for you without changes to the core here?\n" ],

There has to be a better way to say this.\nAnd that's only for the \"left\" reference. \"Up\" and \"up left\" references will be even harder to describe.\n\nI think a better approach is to say that filters may reference neighboring pixels, but that each byte of a pixel is referenced separately.\nThis only applies when the bit depth is >8 bit.

      "description" : "The logic that chooses the next unstaged change after staging a change is kind of janky and breaks my flow. I'll call this a bug, call it what you want. I _believe_ the logic is basically nothing. It just tries to keep the vertical _visual_ position in the tree of unstaged changes. Since that is a _tree_ though, it feels weird. Everything is fine if you have a flat list of files, but I usually don't.\n\nHere's the set up:\n```\nmkdir -p /tmp/treebug\ncd /tmp/treebug\ngit init\n\necho hunk > f\nmkdir g\n  echo hunk > g/g\n  echo hunk > g/h\necho hunk > i\necho hunk > j\n```\nThen enter `gitui`...\n\n<img height=\"300\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ac3b5ad-211e-472d-a157-359a714eb81c\" />\n\n## Moving into directories\n\nOk, let's stage `f`.\n\n<img height=\"300\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ec92fa8-45b3-4e42-b8dd-f678d8da744e\" />\n\nHm, I did not move to the next file. Instead, I moved to the directory g. So just pressing enter repeatedly will not stage file by file, but sometimes stage directories. I don't like this, but whatever. The big issue arises when I am staging from the diff view. This is my initial diff view:\n\n<img height=\"300\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4518d7b-4721-44d3-8650-62e5e3da5b77\" />\n\nNow, when I stage this hunk, my next screen is the following:\n\n<img height=\"300\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3cef7add-901e-4e96-902b-0c83e5d03351\" />\n\nI am seeing the diff of nothing, and I can't do anything in this view. I am forced to return to the tree and navigate to the next file. So staging hunk-by-hunk by repeatedly pressing enter does not work either.\n\n## Moving out of directories\n\nOkay, `f` has been staged. We navigated to the next file manually:\n\n<img height=\"300\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60b158f1-8800-45f0-8033-14becbd89729\" />\n\nLet's stage `g`:\n\n<img height=\"300\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a19e876b-ca3f-4412-baaf-f47b05d0a996\" />\n\nGood, let's stage `h`:\n\n<img height=\"300\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9e86ac8-6e67-4d47-a032-1d0335fe4b46\" />\n\nWe just skipped `i`. That is frustrating. Again, in the file tree view, I can correct this. In the diff view, I cannot.\n\n## The fix\n\nNot sure, one would have to experiment. Maybe this would already work:\n\n- After staging a _file_, move to the next _file_.\n- After staging a _directory_, keep the vertical position in the GUI.",

Add the `static` seal to the config file as [documented](https://openbao.org/docs/configuration/seal/static/):\n   ```hcl\n   seal \"static\" {\n     current_key_id = \"0D5D9911-593C-4AA3-B594-09382AE85879\"\n     current_key = \"file:///opt/secrets/seal-secret/currentKey\"\n   }\n   ```\n2. Start OpenBao.\n3. Observe error log message:\n   ```\n   Error parsing Seal configuration: Unknown KMS type \"static\"\n   ```\n\n**Expected behavior**\nOpenBao should recognize the `static` seal in the config file, as per the documentation.\n\n**Environment:**\n* OpenBao Server Version (retrieve with `bao status`): v2.3.2\n* OpenBao CLI Version (retrieve with `bao version`): v2.3.2\n* Server Operating System/Architecture: Kubernetes v1.30.6\n\nOpenBao server configuration file(s):\n\n```hcl\nui = true\n\nlistener \"tcp\" {\n  tls_disable = 1\n  address = \"[::]:8200\"\n  cluster_address = \"[::]:8201\"\n}\n\nstorage \"postgresql\" {\n  # Config injected using env vars\n}\n\nservice_registration \"kubernetes\" {}\n\nseal \"static\" {\n  current_key_id = \"0D5D9911-593C-4AA3-B594-09382AE85879\"\n  current_key = \"file:///opt/secrets/seal-secret/currentKey\"\n}\n```\n\n**Additional context**\nI suspect that this is not yet part of the current release, but it's already documented.

", "I used Make because the openbao-plugins repo contains multiple plugins that we want to release independently. This only works with GoReleaser Pro, which we didn't have access to at the time.\n\nThe make solution has feature parity with the GoReleaser pipeline in the main openbao repo except for Cosign support. It solves the issues we currently see with GoReleaser by building the binary for every architecture in parallel. \n\nWhile this works very well and I am personally a big fan of Make, I'm not sure it's the best tool to use across all of our repositories. The learning curve is very steep and it's not widely used (anymore). There are some alternatives that might be interesting instead:\n\n- [Task](https://taskfile.dev)\n- [Just](https://just.systems)\n- [Mage](https://magefile.org)\n\nRight now I'd be most intrigued to look at Mage because it will allow us to define our build pipeline by writing go functions." ],

Add a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) number. I'd suggest to do so by integration of GitHub and Zenodo (you can also do this regularly for assigning DOI numbers to separate versions, for citing you can use a DOI that represents all versions as it will always point to the latest one). Here's how to integrate Zenodo DOI: [https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/referencing-and-citing-content](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/referencing-and-citing-content)\n",

Babel (LaTeX) adopted a definition recommended by Thierry Bouche years ago (and SILE followed it too more recently), which as far as I understand is typographically sound for `fr` and `fr-CA` (but note that `fr-CH` may prefer a thin space there, or even no guillemet space at all).\r\n\r\nLikewise, for the record, French requires a non-breakable space (but usually stretch/shrinkable as an inter-word space for justification purposes) before a colon -- and a thin space before certain \"high\" punctuation signs `;!?` (with a number of exceptions...), unbreakable too and usually non-variable, ideally around half of the inter-word space, at least in `fr`; `fr-CA` usually does not add that space before the so-said high punctuations)\r\n\r\nObviously/unfortunately, few typesetting software follow these usual/old conventions -- as noted, LaTeX with Babel does, as well as SILE -- But many just use some unbreakable _fixed_ spaces in these cases. FWIW, LibreOffice and MSWord do that (i.e. insert the same fixed nbsp everywhere), though they do implement some of the differences between French from France, Canada and Switzerland ;)", "Maybe in this part https://github.com/typst/typst/blob/main/crates/typst/src/text/smartquote.rs\r\n\r\nany maybe with this we could now doi it with simple show instruction\r\nhttps://github.com/typst/typst/pull/4876\r\nhttps://github.com/typst/typst/issues/4672", "Not sure whether this is even a bug.

For example, if your hypothesis is that the issue arises due to a delay in a response from the backend server, try to change the code so that the backend server always has a delay, and see if the error then shows up 100% of the time on your local machine.\r\n- Explain your proposed fix, the logic behind it, and any other findings/context you have on this thread. You can also link to a [debugging doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qRbvKjJ0A7NPVK8g6XJNISMx_6BuepoCL7F2eIfrGqM/edit) if you prefer.\r\n- Get your approach validated by an Oppia team member.\r\n- Make a PR that fixes the issue.\r\n",

      "description" : "### Description\n\nThis feature request entails the addition of an opt-in feature for extra links which are not stored as an XCom, for static URLs and reduced metaDB bloat.\n\n\n\n### Use case/motivation\n\nAs far as I'm aware, extra links are only supported via XComs. This makes sense for dynamic, task-instance specific / DAG-run specific URLs (e.g. a link to an external Spark job); however, XComs are _not_ an ideal mechanism for static URLs which are only specific to the given operator (rather than the task instance). For example, a very common use case for the Extra Links feature is to point to a static, operator-specific documentation page. Yet, storing that URL in an XCom for each task instance is clearly not ideal in that circumstance, and only adds bloat to the metaDB.\n\n### Related issues\n\nOnly very tangentially related: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/54527\n\n### Are you willing to submit a PR?\n\n- [x] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\nCaveat: I am willing to help with the backend implementation, but I have no understanding or experience regarding react / frontend development.\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n",

When I run `pip-compile` with the latest pip (25.3), pip compile suffers an exception upon attempting to access `template.use_pep517` in piptools/utils.py\", line 492: `AttributeError: 'InstallRequirement' object has no attribute 'use_pep517'`\n\n#### Expected result\n\n`pip-compile` is expected not to be broken\n\n#### Actual result\n\n`pip-compile` is broken when running with the latest version of pip - 25.3.\n\n`pip-tools` relies on many private imports from pip - such as `InstallRequirement` - which makes `pip-compile` very brittle and sensitive to internal changes in `pip` implementation.\n\n```python-traceback\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/local/bin/pip-compile\", line 7, in <module>\n    sys.exit(cli())\n             ^^^^^\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/click/core.py\", line 1442, in __call__\n    return self.main(*args, **kwargs)\n           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/click/core.py\", line 1363, in main\n    rv = self.invoke(ctx)\n         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/click/core.py\", line 1226, in invoke\n    return ctx.invoke(self.callback, **ctx.params)\n           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/click/core.py\", line 794, in invoke\n    return callback(*args, **kwargs)\n           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/click/decorators.py\", line 34, in new_func\n    return f(get_current_context(), *args, **kwargs)\n           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/piptools/scripts/compile.py\", line 460, in cli\n    resolver = resolver_cls(\n               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/piptools/resolver.py\", line 513, in __init__\n    self._constraints_map = {\n                            ^\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/piptools/resolver.py\", line 514, in <dictcomp>\n    ireq_key: combine_install_requirements(ireqs)\n              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/piptools/resolver.py\", line 136, in combine_install_requirements\n    combined_ireq = copy_install_requirement(\n                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/piptools/utils.py\", line 492, in copy_install_requirement\n    \"use_pep517\": template.use_pep517,\n                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nAttributeError: 'InstallRequirement' object has no attribute 'use_pep517'\n```\n\n#### Temporary workaround\n\nA temporary workaround is to downgrade pip to pip==25.2 before running `pip-compile`.",

For fear I would need to re-enter all of those child monitors.\n\n### ?????? Solution\n\nSolution 1: Explain in the delete confirmation box that this will or will not delete child monitors\r\n\r\nSolution 2: Add a checkbox with the text `[ ] Delete child monitors:` and then list all children of this group so the user is aware of what is being deleted.\n\n### ???

I can't get the official Dockerfile running in headless environments, even when changing the base version to use Rust 1.88.0", "I found a solution to use on the terminal via docker.\n\nThis method assumes that the host computer of docker is a **linux** environment. \nOn the windows I couldn't achieve a gpu passthrough, for some reason only allowed me to use CUDA.\n\n### Structure of the project \n\n```\nbrush-app/                      # Main folder\n????????? brush_app/                  \n???   ?????????

Even though the container state that did not identify any display, tests in a computer without a screen should be done.\n\n\n## Files and running\n\nTo run, just follow the folder structure I explained above, and run `docker compose up --build` and after building just use `docker compose up` wheneve you want to start the container.\n\nDockerfile:\n\n```Dockerfile\nARG UBUNTU_VERSION=24.04\nARG NVIDIA_CUDA_VERSION=12.8.1\n\nFROM nvidia/cuda:${NVIDIA_CUDA_VERSION}-devel-ubuntu${UBUNTU_VERSION} AS builder\n\nENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive\nENV PATH=\"/root/.cargo/bin:${PATH}\"\n\n# Basic build deps\nRUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \\\n    git curl build-essential cmake ninja-build pkg-config wget ca-certificates \\\n    libssl-dev libclang-dev \\\n    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\n\n# Install Rust for building Brush\nRUN curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y\n\n# Clone and build Brush\nRUN git clone https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush\nRUN cargo build --release --manifest-path ./brush/Cargo.toml\n\n\n#Runtime\nFROM nvidia/cuda:${NVIDIA_CUDA_VERSION}-runtime-ubuntu${UBUNTU_VERSION} AS runtime\n\nENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive\n\n# Only runtime deps ??? no dev libs\nRUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends --no-install-suggests \\\n    vulkan-tools libvulkan1 mesa-vulkan-drivers \\\n    libstdc++6 libgcc-s1 libgl1 libglew2.2 libopengl0 \\\n    libc6 libomp5 \\\n    libqt5core5a \\\n    libqt5gui5 \\\n    libqt5widgets5 \\\n    libcurl4 \\\n    && apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\n\n# Copy the built Brush binary\nCOPY --from=builder ./brush/target/release/brush_app /usr/local/bin/brush_app\n\nCMD [\"bash\"]\n```\n\nDocker-compose\n\n```yml\nservices: \n  brush_app:\n    container_name: brush\n    volumes:\n      - ./static:/shared/static\n      - /usr/share/vulkan/icd.d:/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d:ro\n    build:\n      context: ./brush_app \n    deploy:\n        resources:\n          reservations:\n            devices:\n              - driver: nvidia\n                count: all\n                capabilities: [gpu]\n    environment:\n        - NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all\n        - NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES=all\n    command: tail -f /dev/null #to let the container run on idle waiting for commands\n    runtime: nvidia\n```\n" ],

This will be helpful to see the total number of commitments.\nEnsure that it shows up across all the different volunteer statuses.\n\n### Proposed changes\n\nAdd a count of the pending commitments (i.e. status: todo / in_progress)\nExample `/my_status` output based on volunteer statuses and the text that is currently displayed.\n\n```\nName (@telegramhandle)\nStatus: PROBATION\nCommitments: 1 (Tracking: 23 Oct 2025 ??? present)\nProbation period: 90 days remaining\nCommitments needed: 2\nPending commitments: 2\n```\n\n```\nName (@telegramhandle)\nStatus: ACTIVE\nCommitments: 2 (Tracking: 23 Oct 2025 ??? present)\nPending commitments: 2\n```\n\n```\nName (@telegramhandle)\nStatus: LEAD\nCommitments: 2 (Tracking: 23 Oct 2025 ??? present)\nPending commitments: 2\n```\n\n```\nName (@telegramhandle)\nStatus: INACTIVE\nCommitments: 2 (Tracking: 23 Oct 2025 ??? present)\nPending commitments: 2\n??????

      "description" : "### Bug Description\n\nArcane does not discover existing docker compose projects in my projects folder upon a new installation.  Arcane creates new projects correctly, but it does not find existing projects.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1) I have a folder for existing compose projects at /volume1/docker with a subfolder for each project.  Each subfolder contains a docker-compose.yaml and an .env file.  /volume1/docker is owned by root:root and each subfolder is owned by username:users\n2) I install arcane using docker compose.  I mount my projects directory into the container using the same absolute path inside of the container as my host\n```\nvolumes:\n  - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock\n  - ./data/:/app/data/\n  - /volume1/docker/:/volume1/docker/\nenvironment:\n  - PUID=1000 # username is non-root user\n  - PGID=100   # users is non-root\n```\n3) During the initial setup of arcane, I set Projects Directory = /volume1/docker/\n\nNone of my existing projects are discovered by Arcane in the projects directory.\nIf I then create a new project using Arcane called \"test1\", the subfolder shows up correctly in /volume1/docker/test1 in the container and on the host.\nIf I copy that test1 folder to /volume1/docker/test2 to simulate an existing project and restart Arcane, Arcane does not see test2 project.  it only sees the test1 project that it created originally.  Both test and test2 folders are in /volume/docker with same permissions.\nIf I remove Arcane from my machine (including its database) and reinstall Arcane from scratch, the new Arcane does not see test1 or test 2.  This is odd as the prior version created test1\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nArcane should discover all my existing docker compose projects in my project folder.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nArcane does not discover exiting projects.  It does not discover existing projects even if created by a prior installation of Arcane.  It also does not discover existing projects created manually outside of arcane in the same projects folder.\n\nIf I have the PUID and PGID set in the docker compose for arcane, I see a permission denied entry in the DEBUG log which looks like the user/group does not have enough permission to the /volume/docker folder.\nThe log file shows\n```\nOct 12 17:25:07.574 INF Filesystem watcher job registered\nOct 12 17:25:07.574 INF Starting scheduler\nOct 12 17:25:07.574 INF Starting job scheduler\nOct 12 17:25:07.574 INF Starting HTTP server port=3552\nOct 12 17:25:07.574 DBG SQL query executed [342.134??s] query=\"SELECT * FROM `settings`\" duration=342.134??s rows=24 file=github.com/ofkm/arcane-backend/internal/services/settings_service.go:244\nOct 12 17:25:07.574 ERR Filesystem watcher failed error=\"permission denied\"\n```\nHowever, if I then remove the PUID and PGID from the container entirely and restart it, Arcane's dashboard shows this error when I go to the \"Projects\" tab:\n`Something went wrong, Internal error 500` with a link to \"Go to Dashboard\".   \n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Arcane Version\n\nv1.5.1\n\n### Operating System\n\nLinux\n\n### Browser\n\nChome\n\n### Docker Version\n\n26.1.0\n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_",

I believe Synology NAS devices do this as well.  Essentially, the permissions reported when running as a NAS user (in this case UID=1000) show up differently than if listing permissions as sudo su -.  The su user sees the underlying filesystem permissions that docker uses, which in this case is 700, not 777.  This means when Arcane runs and tried to attach a filesystem watcher to the /volume1/docker directory, it fails as the root group does not have permission to read/write/execute the /volume1/docker folder.  Unfortunately, if I manually chmod the /volume1/docker folder to apply 770 or 750 permissions to allow the root group to access it for a filesystem watcher, the NAS OS resets it back to 700 in the underlying filesystem.  So I either need to use a different folder for Arcane than what the NAS uses for docker compose or come up with an alternative solution.\n\nIn this case, the docker container can read files in /volume1/docker after that has been mounted in the container.  Is there a way to have a backup capability for filesystem watcher that just does an ls in that directory within the container rather than trying to attach an inotify or whatever Arcane uses to /volume1/docker?  When I type ls /volume/docker1 in the Arcane container, I can see all the project folders and enter directories to see the compose files.   So the container can see them.  It's just that the filesystem watcher gets a permission denied when trying to attach to the /volume/docker1 folder itself,\n", "@languagegame I had a similar issue in\nhttps://github.com/ofkm/arcane/issues/732\n\nMy issue was in the arcane-headless for a remote machine so I don't know if these issues are the same.\n\n@kmendell suggested setting in volumes\n/volume1/docker:/volume1/docker\n\nand setting the environment variable\nPROJECTS_DIR=/volume/docker\n\nI then also had to set environment variables\nPUID={User ID that has permissions}\nPGID={User group ID that has permissions}\n\nThis worked for me when I had similar issues.", "I will have to look into this more" ],

Seems like it might have nice properties, computing the derivative at multiple resolutions and working for aperiodic functions. The frequency content of a wavelet is fairly consistent across its domain too, so there's less potential for poor edge fits due to increased noise sensitivity in those regions, like with polynomial bases.\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169743903001370\n\nFor local, Gaussian wavelets, it seems essentially like `RBFDiff`, although in that case you pick a single radius, so there's no multiscale. Are they really doing the same thing? Would other wavelets be interesting to implement? Apparently even Haar wavelets work for this, which I have trouble picturing since they're piecewise constant, but they're not the best choice, which is apparently \"bi-orthogonal\" wavelets.",

En mi opini??n creo que s?? se deber??an de borrar los archivos en `/www/docs/` con el sufijo `-API` y respecto a lo dem??s tengo dos ideas:\n\n1. [/Controllers/README.md](https://github.com/omegaup/omegaup/blob/main/frontend/server/src/Controllers/README.md) se encuentra muy bien documentado. Hay dos tipos de usuarios que entrar??an a leer el readme: alguien interesado en leer la documentaci??n del repositorio o alguien que est?? trabajando con el c??digo. Actualmente tenemos la informaci??n a la mano para quienes trabajan con el c??digo, sin embargo no para quienes quieren consultar la documentaci??n en general del API. Ese mismo documento es ??til para ambos usuarios y contiene toda la informaci??n necesaria, y desde que es acerca del mismo t??pico (api) es m??s f??cil mantenerlo en un solo archivo que dividirlo en varios, porque ser??a crear m??s pasos para leer la documentaci??n (hay que considerar el caso en que alguien desee retroceder, leer todo el archivo, entre otros). Por lo tanto, es que creo que una opci??n ser??a clonar el mismo README hacia `www/docs/` con el nombre API.md o en su efecto crear una funci??n en APITOOLS.php que genere el mismo archivo pero en la ruta `www/docs/`\n\n\n```md\nControllers/\nREADME.md\n\n-- y\n\nwww/docs/\nControllers.md\n\n```\n\n2. Usar una sola fuente. Presentar la documentaci??n en `/docs/` (no duplicar el contenido) \n\nwww/docs/Controllers.md\n```\nControllers/\nREADME.md  <- fuente ??nica\nwww/docs/\nControllers.md   <- muestra el readme\n```\n\nControllers.md lucir??a algo as??:\n\n```\nLa documentaci??n de los controladores se mantiene en:\n[`Controllers/README.md`](../../Controllers/README.md)\n```\n\nSi alguien clona solo la documentaci??n del repositorio tendr??a que clonar dos archivos en vez de uno, me gusta m??s la idea de tener dos archivos con toda la informaci??n de la documentaci??n (1 copia del readme en docs)", "Me agrada mucho la segunda opci??n!\n\n??Qu?? te parece si en `Controllers.md` se agrega un ??ndice con todos los controladores que tenemos y que cada opci??n te lleve a la secci??n del README donde se encuentra la informaci??n de cada uno?\n\nTomando en cuenta que el contenido es auto-generado, ser??a bueno que este archivo tambi??n se creara en `APITool.php` o al menos buscar una forma de mantenerlo actualizado en lo posible", "Hi i want to know is this issue resolved ?  If not then can you please assign me \n", "Hello @coderrDikshant!

Recently, 2 URLs failed htmlproofer access, causing the trestle validation pipeline to fail for all newly submitted trestle PRs.

When I put a automation line that mutes and unmutes instruments to create a stutter effect, it gets activated by the automation line when another instrument is active. I found a workaround, which consists of the automation line muting a FX channel that is linked to the instrument.\r\n#### Steps to reproduce\r\nOpen a project with several instruments, and create a automation line that mutes and unmutes an instrument. Then export tracks. Voli?? there you go.\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\nThe currently inactive instrument stays muted\r\n#### Actual behavior\r\nThe currently inactive instrument gets unmuted\r\n#### Screenshot\r\n![lmmsbug](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12591074/94984060-0785dc80-0583-11eb-9044-a35959f34c3a.png)\r\n#### Affected LMMS versions\r\nI tested it in `Version 1.2.1 (Linux/x86_64, Qt 5.12.8, GCC 9.3.0)`, but I suspect all versions where 'export tracks' exists are affected.\r\n",

Let's say I automate \"Solo\" so that a certain track is soloed at a specific point in the song. Well, I can accomplish the same by making sure that only this track has clips at that position. If I automate \"Mute\" then I can accomplish the same by having no clips at that position.\r\n\r\n## Proposal to remove automation for \"Solo\" and \"Mute\"\r\nSo I propose that the fix is to remove the automation functionality from \"Mute\" and \"Solo\". Stutter effects should be implemented with plugins which then might also provide options to define an attack and release curve so that the transitions are softer and do not create pops like an automation of \"Mute\" and \"Solo\" likely does.", "counterpoint: mute/unmute is very intuitive to automate, and the alternative is automating yet another effect (e.g. an amplifier). the effects rack is already pretty overfull in many cases, so I'd rather use the mute button. And I believe it'd be incredibly tedious to replicate the solo button with channels in the mixer. Other DAWs behaving differently is incidental; LMMS shouldn't do things just because other programs do them.\r\n\r\nadditionally, there's the issue of removing features breaking existing tracks.", "> counterpoint: mute/unmute is very intuitive to automate, and the alternative is automating yet another effect (e.g. an amplifier). the effects rack is already pretty overfull in many cases, so I'd rather use the mute button.

Random people open random new bug tickets. They will first get in the \"triage\" label for initial review.\n2. First team reviewer checks: Is it a bug? Can we reproduce it? Further info needed? What priority? Etc.\n3. Team removes \"triage\" label, instead maybe adds other labels to categorize the issue more clearly\n\n#### Expected result of feature\n\n- Status of bugs is clearly obvious, missing information can be added immediately\n\n#### Extra information, such as ideas for how to implement:\n\nTriaging workflows are recommended but vary wildly in details, e.g.\nhttps://www.kubernetes.dev/docs/guide/issue-triage/\n\nVadi comments:\n> I think it is a good idea, but we are volunteers here - and I'm not a fan of more admin burden. If we have 2-3 people stepping up to do the triaging, then I'm all for it, otherwise it is perhaps a bit too early for our little volunteer corp.\n\nLooking for 2-3 volunteers helping here, I can help as well.",

It should support:\n\n* Duration\n* Bits (1000)\n* Bytes (1024)\n* Percent\n\nWe need two signatures for that function since sometimes I might not want to rely on the auto conversation and I want to fix everything to be displayed in `GB`. Otherwise I might end up with values of KB, MB, TB and so on in the same column.\n",

Reset the scale factor in `res://scenes/game_elements/props/sequence_puzzle_object/sequence_puzzle_object.tscn` to (1, 1)\n2. Find all scenes that reference it:\n   \n   <img width=\"667\" height=\"344\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9104428-873f-4c0b-8d9d-54730750873b\" />\n3. In each scene, determine what adjustments need to be made, if any.\n\nI expect that the Stella scene will need the most changes because the six objects are carefully positioned to line up with a turtle asset. Other scenes will probably be OK with a bit of tweaking of positions.\n\n### XP Summary (total 300)\n\n| Subdomain | Skill | XP |\n| - | - | - |\n| Game Design: Game Feel & UX | Problem Solving | 150 |\n| Game Design: Game Feel & UX | Creativity & Design Thinking | 75 |\n| Game Design: Game Feel & UX | Technical Literacy | 75 |",

      "repositoryName" : "Mentra-Community/MentraOS",
      "description" : "## Problem\n\n  Console and Store websites have duplicate auth implementations (LoginPage, EmailAuthModal, AuthContext, supabase config). Meanwhile,\n  third-party apps already use centralized auth via `account.mentra.glass/auth?packagename=X`.\n\n  **We should use the same pattern for our internal websites.**\n\n  ## Current State\n\n  **Account Website** (`cloud/websites/account/`)\n  - Already handles auth for TPAs via `/auth?packagename=X`\n  - Has working OAuth flow: `AuthFlowPage.tsx`\n  - Just needs extension to support websites (not just app packages)\n\n  **Console** (`cloud/websites/console/`)\n  - Duplicate auth: `AuthPage.tsx`, `EmailAuthModal.tsx`, `useAuth.tsx`, `supabase.ts` ???\n  - Unique need: Organization invite handling\n\n  **Store** (`cloud/websites/store/`)\n  - Duplicate auth: `LoginPage.tsx`, `EmailAuthModal.tsx`, `useAuth.tsx`, `supabase.ts` ???\n  - Unique need: WebView token injection for mobile app\n\n  ## Solution\n\n  ### 1. Extend Account Website\n\n  Update `AuthFlowPage.tsx` to handle both apps and websites:\n\n  **App auth:** `?packagename=X` ??? existing flow (show consent, generate signed token)\n  **Website auth:** `?client_id=console&redirect_uri=URL&state=X` ??? new flow (skip consent, generate auth code)\n\n  Parameters for website auth:\n  - `client_id`: \"console\" or \"store\"\n  - `redirect_uri`: Callback URL\n  - `state`: CSRF protection\n  - `invite_token`: Optional, for org invites\n\n  ### 2. Update Console Website\n\n  **Add:**\n  - `src/utils/authClient.ts` - OAuth redirect helper\n  - `src/pages/AuthCallback.tsx` - Handle callback, exchange code for tokens\n\n  **Modify:**\n  - ProtectedRoute ??? redirect to `account.mentra.glass/auth?client_id=console&...`\n  - Org invite flow ??? pass `invite_token` through OAuth state\n\n  **Delete:**\n  - `src/pages/AuthPage.tsx`\n  - `src/components/EmailAuthModal.tsx`\n  - `src/utils/supabase.ts`\n\n  ### 3. Update Store Website\n\n  **Add:**\n  - `src/utils/authClient.ts`\n  - `src/pages/AuthCallback.tsx`\n\n  **Modify:**\n  - ProtectedRoute ??? detect WebView (skip redirect) or web (redirect to Account)\n  - Keep WebView token injection logic intact\n\n  **Delete:**\n  - `src/pages/LoginPage.tsx`\n  - `src/components/EmailAuthModal.tsx`\n\n  ### 4. Backend API\n\n  **New endpoints:**\n\n  ```typescript\n  POST /api/account/oauth/generate-code\n  // Input: authenticated session, clientId, redirectUri\n  // Output: { code } (5 min expiry, single-use)\n\n  POST /api/account/oauth/exchange-code\n  // Input: { code, clientId }\n  // Output: { supabaseToken, coreToken, userId, inviteToken? }\n```\n\n# Implementation Steps\n\n## Account Website\n\n  - Extend AuthFlowPage.tsx to detect client_id vs packagename\n  - Add website OAuth flow (no consent, return code)\n  - Test redirect flow\n\n## Console Migration\n\n  - Create OAuth client + callback handler\n  - Update ProtectedRoute to redirect to Account\n  - Remove old auth components\n  - Handle org invites via OAuth\n  - Test full flow\n\n## Store Migration\n\n  - Create OAuth client + callback handler\n  - Add WebView detection to ProtectedRoute\n  - Remove old auth components (preserve WebView logic)\n  - Test web + WebView flows\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n  - Console uses Account website for auth\n  - Store uses Account website for web auth\n  - Store WebView auth still works\n  - Org invites still work\n  - No duplicate auth components",

It would help to automate this during the website build process.\n\nThe idea here is:\n* add templating support to the website resources, so that the build would interpret templating instructions, not only variable references supported by the resources plugin\n* replace references to specific GlassFish versions with variables\n* redefine a variable with a specific version before each block and then reuse it in the whole block\n\nFor example, with velocity engine, it could look like:\n\n```\n#set($version = \"7.0.24\")\n\nGlassFish version $version brings new features...\n\nDownload at https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/ee4j/glassfish/glassfish-$version.zip\n\n#set($version = \"7.0.23\")\n\nGlassFish version $version brings new features...\n\nDownload at https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/ee4j/glassfish/glassfish-$version.zip\n\n```\n\nPossible options:\n\n* replace the standard maven resources plugin with an existing maven plugin that supports templating, e.g. [MojoHaus Templating Maven Plugin](https://www.mojohaus.org/templating-maven-plugin/)\n* create a [custom resource filter](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-resources-plugin/examples/custom-resource-filters.html) for the resources plugin that calls velocity or some other templating engine - no such custom resource exists out of the box, we would have to create one and wrap a templating engine\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nHappens everytime we update the glassfish.org website after a new GlassFish release.\n\n### Impact of Issue\n\n_No response_",

Just do it and offer PR for review.\n\n\n", "Hello, @Ariho-Seth , this issue is more about improving the build of the website and possibly creating a helper Maven plugin to support templating in the source code of the website. If you'd like to try it, I can mentor you a bit. But if you don't like tinkering with the build and Maven, maybe there's a better issue for you to pick up.\n\nIn any case, the best thing to do for a start is building GlassFish itself. You can find some help about it in the build section of the [README file](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish?tab=readme-ov-file#building)\n\nThen, if you decided to investigate this issue, it's good to start with building the website locally. There's no documentation for this I think, I should write something about it. Right now, I can share my script that I execute to run a preview of the page locally. I use this script on Ubuntu Linux with zsh shell:\n\n```\nGLASSFISH_REPO=../glassfish\nGF_DOCS_DIR=\"$GLASSFISH_REPO\"/docs/publish/target/staging\n\n# Build all docs artifacts (PDFs and HTML)\n#mvn -f \"$GLASSFISH_REPO\"/docs/pom.xml -T4C clean install\n\nmvn -f \"$GLASSFISH_REPO\"/docs/pom.xml -T4C -pl website,distribution -Ppublish-site clean install\nmvn -f \"$GLASSFISH_REPO\"/docs/publish/pom.xml clean install\n\n\necho \"source 'https://rubygems.org'\ngem 'github-pages', group: :jekyll_plugins\ngem 'jekyll-theme-eclipsefdn'\ngem 'webrick'\ngem 'jekyll-toc'\n\" > \"$GF_DOCS_DIR\"/Gemfile\n\nsed -i 's!remote_theme: eclipsefdn/jekyll-theme-eclipsefdn!theme: jekyll-theme-eclipsefdn!' \"$GF_DOCS_DIR\"/_config.yml\n\ngrep repository \"$GF_DOCS_DIR\"/_config.yml > /dev/null || echo '\\nrepository: eclipse-ee4j/glassfish' >> \"$GF_DOCS_DIR\"/_config.yml\n\nbundle install --gemfile \"$GF_DOCS_DIR\"/Gemfile\n\nzsh -c \"cd $GF_DOCS_DIR; bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental\"\n# run `bundle exec jekyll serve` in GF_DOCS_DIR   \n```\n\nInstead of zsh you can use bash, or just type the `cd $GF_DOCS_DIR; bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental` command in the terminal manually. The `sed` and `grep` commands update the _config.yml file to point to a local theme and correct repository.\nAnd you need to install Ruby, sorry :-) ", "Hello @OndroMih, Thanks for accepting to help me out.\nThough the script above is throwing some errors even after installing Ruby and starting the Glassfish with `bin/startserv`\n\n`Error logs.`\n```\nzsh: missing end of string\n[INFO] Scanning for projects...\n[ERROR] [ERROR] Could not find the selected project in the reactor: org.glassfish.main.distributions:glassfish @ \n[ERROR] Could not find the selected project in the reactor: org.glassfish.main.distributions:glassfish -> [Help 1]\n[ERROR] \n[ERROR] To see the full stack trace of the errors, re-run Maven with the -e switch.\n[ERROR] Re-run Maven using the -X switch to enable full debug logging.\n[ERROR] \n[ERROR] For more information about the errors and possible solutions, please read the following articles:\n[ERROR] [Help 1] http://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MAVEN/MavenExecutionException\n[INFO] Scanning for projects...\n[ERROR] [ERROR] Could not find the selected project in the reactor: org.glassfish.main.distributions:glassfish @ \n[ERROR] Could not find the selected project in the reactor: org.glassfish.main.distributions:glassfish -> [Help 1]\n[ERROR] \n[ERROR] To see the full stack trace of the errors, re-run Maven with the -e switch.\n[ERROR] Re-run Maven using the -X switch to enable full debug logging.\n[ERROR] \n[ERROR] For more information about the errors and possible solutions, please read the following articles:\n[ERROR] [Help 1] http://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MAVEN/MavenExecutionException\n[INFO] Scanning for projects...\n[ERROR] [ERROR] Could not find the selected project in the reactor: org.glassfish.main.distributions:glassfish @ \n[ERROR] Could not find the selected project in the reactor: org.glassfish.main.distributions:glassfish -> [Help 1]\n[ERROR] \n[ERROR] To see the full stack trace of the errors, re-run Maven with the -e switch.\n[ERROR] Re-run Maven using the -X switch to enable full debug logging.\n[ERROR] \n[ERROR] For more information about the errors and possible solutions, please read the following articles:\n[ERROR] [Help 1] http://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MAVEN/MavenExecutionException\nzsh: no such file or directory: ../glassfish/docs/publish/target/staging/Gemfile\nsed: 1: \"../glassfish/docs/publi ...\": invalid command code .\ngrep: ../glassfish/docs/publish/target/staging/_config.yml: No such file or directory\nzsh: no such file or directory: ../glassfish/docs/publish/target/staging/_config.yml\n\n[!] There was an error parsing `Gemfile`: No such file or directory @ rb_sysopen - /Users/2/ariho/Programming/Opensource-Projects/glassfish/docs/publish/target/staging/Gemfile.

The idea is to add templating support to the website resources, replace references to specific GlassFish versions with variables, and redefine a variable with a specific version before each block and then reuse it in the whole block.\r\n\r\nThe issue is discussed in the comments, where a new contributor is trying to help and is having trouble running the script to build the website locally.\r\n\r\nThe contributor is having trouble with the script, getting errors such as 'POM file specified with the -f/--file command line argument does not exist' and 'Could not locate Gemfile or .bundle/ directory'.\r\n\r\nThe contributor is also having trouble running the script in the root of the GlassFish repository, but it starts running a site at localhost, but it doesn't look like the expected GlassFish website.\r\n\r\nThe issue is resolved when the contributor deletes the copy of the templated and runs the script again.\r\n\r\nThe issue is labeled as 'good first issue' and is a good opportunity for a new contributor to learn about the build process of the GlassFish website.",

If `.copy()` creates a returns a new `PVector` object, then the initial assignment would have no effect. This led to some confusion amongst my students who had various incorrect assumptions about how `.copy()` works given the example code.\n\n### Suggested correction\n\n```\r\nPVector v1, v2;\r\n\r\nvoid setup() {\r\n  size(100, 100);\r\n  v1 = new PVector(20.0, 30.0, 40.0);\r\n  v2 = v1.copy();\r\n  ...\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Language\n\n_No response_\n\n### Screenshots or references\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

Convert the text into geometry and then use the geometry???s stroke and fill to render the outline.\nReference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/wpf/advanced/how-to-create-outlined-text\n\n2. Create multiple TextBlock controls, each with different stroke colors and offsets, and stack them together.\nI???m not sure how much performance this approach would cost.\nReference: https://blog.csdn.net/u013113678/article/details/120773532\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Validations\n\n- [x] I confirm that I am submitting a Feature request\n- [x] I have read all the [issues](https://github.com/SakiRinn/LiveCaptions-Translator/issues)/[wiki](https://github.com/SakiRinn/LiveCaptions-Translator/wiki) and made sure there is no duplicate\n- [x] I have tried the latest version and the function still not exists\n- [x] I have checked if the issue is related to my environment configuration, network, etc.\n- [x] Besides my preferred language, I have added English in the title and description\n- [x] I will be polite and respectful in my communication",

As for testing, while you don't need to test the validator logic, I think it would be valuable for us to have some tests to ensure that the update succeeds when validation passes or fails when validation fails. We have some existing update testing in the [InferenceCrudIT tests](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/main/x-pack/plugin/inference/qa/inference-service-tests/src/javaRestTest/java/org/elasticsearch/xpack/inference/InferenceCrudIT.java) so we can likely expand the tests there.\n\nAside from this, I'll add a comment on your PR as I believe the change will require more than just calling the `ModelValidatorBuilder`." ],

      "description" : "## Goal\nImplement protocol data pruning to reclaim disk space and manage the growth of disk usage.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore designing the solution, consider the following questions, as they may influence the overall approach:\n- Engine reuse:\nConsider reusing existing engines for iterating and pruning to reduce implementation complexity and improve consistency. For reference, see the [chunk data pack pruner](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/blob/master/engine/execution/pruner/engine.go#L31).\n- Pruning granularity:\nThe pruner typically operates by view???it first locates blocks by view and then prunes data associated with those blocks. In other words, pruning happens at the block level. Are there any types of data not indexed by block ID? If so, how should they be pruned? For example, VN???s chunk locator may not be block-indexed.\n- Retention policy:\nFor block-indexed data, at what point does it become eligible for pruning? Should pruning be based on data older than X days or beyond X epochs?\n- Storage locks:\nDoes the pruning process require storage locks? If locks are needed, they might interrupt write operations that insert data for the latest blocks. Would it be safe to omit locks when pruning data from older epochs?\n- Edge case ??? dynamic bootstrapping:\nIf all nodes prune simultaneously, a height range gap may form where no node retains certain blocks. This would prevent new nodes from dynamically bootstrapping from blocks within that gap, leading to potential synchronization issues.\n",

I think I might have figured out how to prevent the extension from crashing when copying large items but it might be machine/data dependent so if you have the time could you do me a favor and try running the latest version (v1.3.1) in development mode and copying the same sql dumps you previously copied?\r\n\r\nYou can download the latest version here: https://github.com/ayoung19/clipboard-history/releases.\r\n\r\nIt'd also be nice if you could export your clipboard history and import it into the development version when doing this test.

Will look into this more later but I think the general concept works as long as I can get the intervals to dynamically change: increase polling interval when reading the clipboard takes longer. This means it can support extremely large copies.\r\n\r\nThe size filtering option may still be nice to have even when the extension can support large items though to conserve disk space.", "@dani0332 Crashing caused by copying large items has been fixed in v1.3.5. The extension will still degrade in performance for EXTREMELY large copies like ~10mb but won't crash. To alleviate this a setting for the maximum number of characters to save was introduced in the same version as well.", "@ayoung19 Just saw comment, I was caught up with work & I am not familiar with chrome extension development so wouldn't be much of an help for you.

As part of this logic we escape double quotes with backslashes since we wrap the individual values in double quotes. However, we don't escape backslashes, so the string `\\\"` becomes `\\\\\"` which the KQL parser interprets as a literal backslash followed by double quote as a special character.\n\nWe should change the escaping logic to something like `const escapeQuotes = (val: string) => val.replace(/[\\\\\"]/g, '\\\\$&');` so the string `\\\"` in a tag becomes `\\\\\\\"` in the KQL query, and the parser interprets it as a literal backslash and literal double quote.",

I added this bug to it.", "I agree. I'd also file it under \"low impact\". Users can still find the rule if they type in its name in the searchbox without special chars.

      "description" : "IndexWriter provides a `forceMergeDeletes` API which triggers force merging of all segments that have deleted documents, allowing users to expunge deletes up to a configurable delete percentage (set via `setForceMergeDeletesPctAllowed()`). \n\nThe API provides a blocking variant, which waits until the merges complete, and a non-blocking variant, that starts the merges in background threads and returns. For the non-blocking version, it would be nice to have the ability to monitor if merges have completed. Turns out, all we need for this, is to return the `MergeSpecification` that defines the merges triggered by the API.\n\nIndeed, the blocking variant of this API itself uses this spec to wait until all merges have completed. This is what would happen if you were using the `ConcurrentMergeScheduler` which will start merges in background, but invoked the API with `doWait=true`. However, there are benefits to being able to monitor from outside the API, like waiting only unto a max timeout, or reporting metrics on the progress of these merges.\n\nThe change here is to change this API return type from void to `MergePolicy.MergeSpecification` and return the `spec` object.\n\nThis is a spin-off from #14431 which has more context on the use case.",

It could help applications track and emit monitoring metrics on merge progress. @jpountz / @mikemccand ??? Do you have any reservations with making this return type change in the API?", "The idea makes sense to me, it's interesting to gain additional visibility into what merging decisions the merge policy actually makes (and specifically whether it thinks that some merging is required or not).\n\nI'm not too happy about exposing `MergeSpecification` and `OneMerge` in public non-expert APIs, I wonder if we can clean them up (e.g. so that they are no longer mutable) or if we should make `IndexWriter#forceMergeDeletes` exposed a trimmed down version of these classes that just exposes the list of merged `SegmentCommitInfo`s.", "I'd like to work on this and wanted to check my approach first.\n\nLooking at @jpountz's comment about the visibility (and mutability) issue - what if we add a simple `MergeObserver` wrapper class that holds the `MergeSpecification` internally but only exposes read-only methods? Things like checking merge count, waiting for completion, etc.\n\nIt would be in the same package, allowing it to call the existing package-private methods. `forceMergeDeletes()` would then wrap and return it (in place of void). The spec reference stays private to prevent any modifications.\n\nDoes it make sense?", "Hi @vigyasharma,\n\nI've implemented this in PR #15378.\nI added `MergePolicy.MergeObserver` with methods for checking merge status, waiting synchronously or asynchronously, and accessing individual merges. The implementation is thread-safe, handles edge cases, and is fully backward compatible.\n\nI included also tests that have been verified across thousands of iterations.

A larger graph generally means worse compile times for inductor, unless inductor does extra work to avoid it.\r\n\r\nInstead, one thing we can do is recognize when a bunch of inputs were mutated by a single `foreach_*` op, and emit a single `foreach_copy_()` node in the graph in their place. We need to take care though that the inputs to the `foreach` op are preserved in the right order\n\ncc @crcrpar @mcarilli @janeyx99 @ezyang @msaroufim @anijain2305 @zou3519",

I have assigned the issue to you.\n\nThanks,\nTharika.", "@tharikaGitHub @ashera96 It seems to be that this is how MUI default styling is defined. The component that related this in the current codebase does not override any property that affects the input labels.\n\nfollowings are the all overrides for this component. Only width has overrided.\n\n```jsx\nconst Root = styled('div')(({ theme }) => ({\n    [`& .${classes.formControl}`]: {\n        width: '500px',\n    },\n    [`& .${classes.subTitle}`]: {\n        fontSize: '1rem',\n        paddingTop: theme.spacing(1),\n        paddingBottom: theme.spacing(1),\n        marginBottom: theme.spacing(1),\n    },\n    [`& .${classes.configContainer}`]: {\n        paddingTop: '10px',\n    },\n    [`& .${classes.configSubContainer}`]: {\n        paddingBottom: '10px',\n        marginTop: '5px',\n        padding: '5px',\n    },\n    [`& .${classes.textField}`]: {\n        marginRight: theme.spacing(1),\n        width: '45%',\n    },\n    [`& .${classes.advanceDialogActions}`]: {\n        display: 'flex',\n        justifyContent: 'flex-end',\n    },\n}));\n```\n\nIf I override the input label property and try to make the input lables align with the other left aligned tags as folows, (MUI uses transform to align labels)\n\n```jsx\n    [`& .${classes.formControl} .MuiInputLabel-outlined`]: {\n        transform: 'translate(0, 6px) scale(1)',\n    },\n```\n\nThis affects to all input labels but labels which are not inside the input boxes does not goes as we expect.\n\nResults in a inconsistency like this\n\n<img width=\"600\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09116c64-99db-4f43-aef8-e5f7af5ce37e\" />\n\n\nThen tried adjusting it through this `classes.subTitle` class but it didn't reflect any change.\n\nMy guess is we should keep this as the way it is now in the original code since it is perfectly aligned with other input labels (Error Code, Initial Duration, Factor and etc) using the default MUI styling.\n\nIf `Action` label needs to be algined with the `Connection timeout` for some intentional reason, I could specifically target and override that tag's style using MUI's `sx` property.\n\nLet me know what to do or if I have misunderstood anything.", "Hi @Chamal1120,\n\nThank you for the analysis. As we have a default value already set for the Action dropdown in the Connection Timeout section, the input label `Action` is seen closer to the heading than it should ideally be. This gives a disconnected feeling to the `Action` label and the dropdown that it should be attached to.\n\n<img width=\"598\" height=\"691\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a0b7d97-7b14-44b8-b46e-45922bc5d3ac\" />\n\n\nWe could either increase the gap between the heading and the `Action` label to give more sense to it. What do you think?\n\nThanks,\nTharika.\n", "@tharikaGitHub I can agree with providing a space between Connection timeout heading and Action label would make it much pleasing to the eye. The target css variable for these labels without input boxes is `classes.subTitle` I think. I tried adding various classic css properties to it but they never reflect a change. I'll try grepping the MUI documentation once more.\n\nOtherwise the only option is to manually target these two label tags (`error code` and `action`) and use `sx` property. Will that be fine?", "Hi @Chamal1120,\n\nCan you maybe try to change the dropdown styling to align the other input fields (refer to [1])? Then the action label will remain within the boundaries of that dropdown itself. Can you try that change and attach a screenshot?\n\n[1] https://mui.com/material-ui/react-select/#basic-select", "> Hi [@Chamal1120](https://github.com/Chamal1120),\n> \n> Can you maybe try to change the dropdown styling to align the other input fields (refer to [1])?

Was able to do that easily by adding a top margin property to the `formControl` tag.\n\n#### This looks somewhat better when all dropdowns are selected as can be seen below.\n<img width=\"2542\" height=\"1362\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e96c7ea1-1c0a-4393-8edf-a1cae5e607b5\" />\n\n#### However when dropdowns are deselected, this is how it looks\n<img width=\"2548\" height=\"1358\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66b894f2-ce94-433c-b494-93de322913b9\" />\n\n#### Watch this video to see how it transitions\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4d51c68-8354-4d5c-b6a4-f81c5ca5b63d\n\n\nWhat are your thoughts @ashera96 @tharikaGitHub ?", "Also @ashera96 how do I test the Advanced Configurations modals of AI APIs and MCP Servers?\nIs there a guide to create those as well like PizzaShack API?", "@tharikaGitHub @ashera96 Can I get a review on my analysis on the UI change?" ],

But the moment we have redundant directories or that there is a large skew of files in one directory and not that many files in the other directories, parallelizing this would not give much of a performance benefit and could possibly cause some hindrances.\n\nWhat I want to suggest is the following:\n-  Instead of each thread owning a path to traverse through, we use up to max core threads per path. Here's what I'm thinking:\n    - Each thread has a specific bounded queue that takes in directory paths. It pops off from this queue to traverse that directory, seeing the files and directories contained inside.\n    - Initially, we could push the current path that we are examining into the first thread/queue.\n    - To load balance the directory traversal among threads, for a certain batch number of directories that a thread visits/collects (including following symlinks to a directory with -L flag), it enqueues those directories onto another thread's queue.\n    - The data structure needed for this would be a shared multiqueue data structure, where you use it so that threads only dequeue from their own specific queue, but are otherwise free to enqueue to another queue.\n- To take care of avoiding redundant directories, we could use a HashSet guarded by a RwLock that contains directory paths. When a thread pops off a directory it visits in its queue, it confirms with the HashSet first to see if this directory was visited already. If so, then we don't need to traverse this directory again. Otherwise, we would perform the traversal.\n    - The one thing that I am concerned about this is how expensive this check and insertion of paths to the HashSet would be.\n- Because doing this synchronously could potentially cause some blocking issues or delays (i.e. if a thread is trying to insert a directory path in another thread's bounded queue, but that thread's queue is full), maybe we could do this in asynchronous manner and give threads dequeue/enqueue tasks on the directories it can traverse + give directories to other thread's queues in a nonblocking manner. \n\nI actually created an [asynchronous multiqueue data structure](https://github.com/asder8215/sharded_ringbuf) that's perfectly suited and tuned for this sort of work.\n\nWhat do you think about this approach?" ],

      "comments" : [ "Thank you. I can take care of this. Hopefully this evening.\nDo you by any chance have a link to tell me about \"findbar\" client, ot Magento client software?", "Thank you for the fast response.\n\nFindbar is our on-site search SaaS (https://findbar.io) and the user agent is used by our Magento 2 plugin for API requests to our service (it is not a bot/crawler).", "Thank you for this. The balance between accuracy and efficiency of a large pattern like the one we're maintaining here is always a bit tricky.\nThe \"agent\" substring, for example, also matches for \"meta externalagent\" and \"GomezAgent\" (synthetic). So you see how a common denominator can be considered beneficial.\n\nThis is why we maintain an extensive and expansive database of user agent strings to verify our pattern against.\n\nTo be honest, your use case sounds like it answers to the definition of an automated client, which is also sometimes treated as a bot (for load sake or other reasons).\n\nYour case, tho, is definitely not a case of deliberate recognition, and this is why I'm still debating how to treat it.\n\nThis week, I am on holiday so it might take me longer to look into this issue more critically. At the moment, I'm looking into introducing more work boundaries to the pattern parts to make matches more intentional, and subsequently probably stop recognising your user agent as bot.\n\nI will be working on this (at the moment exploratory) research in this draft: https://github.com/omrilotan/isbot/pull/297\n\nAs a workaround in the meantime, you can ignore the parts of the pattern that recognise your tool by creating an \"isbot\" instance like so:\n\n```ts\nimport {\n  createIsbotFromList,\n  isbotMatches,\n  list,\n} from 'isbot';\n\nconst patternsToRemove = isbotMatches('Magento/2.4.5 (Findbar 1.5.12)');\nconst isbot = createIsbotFromList(\n  list.filter(\n    (record) => patternsToRemove.includes(record) === false,\n  )\n);\n\nconsole.log(isbot('Magento/2.4.5 (Findbar 1.5.12)')); // false\n```\n\nI will keep you appraised as I go along", "Thank you for the thorough response and engagement.\n\nI have already tackled the problem locally, but it would be nice to have some peace of mind on future updates \uD83D\uDE03 \n\nRegarding the specific user agent string I mentioned, please note that it should definitely not be included as-is, since can easily  change due to version changes in both Magento and the Findbar module.\n\nTo be honest, since our module only makes requests to _our_ service, it would be almost impossible to cause any issues requiring action to anyone else out there.\n\nHowever, I feel that randomly matching \"Magento\" (which is one of the leading open source e-commerce platforms) while trying to match \"agent\" is wrong by definition due to semantics. This could easily cause trouble to other Magento modules that use the word magento in the user agent string for whatever reason.\n\nTherefore, maybe an exception for \"magento\" specifically would be enough; something like (?<!m)agent would do the trick without affecting the rest of your logic.", "Thank you. That sounds good.\nIf there's no urgency, I think what I'll do is invest in adding word boundaries for more pattern segments to make sure we don't get many misidentifications. And I'll just pick it up on Monday after my holiday, to make sure the next version improves significantly.\nThank you for all the details." ],

This process can take up to 30 seconds, especially if the initial request has timed out (which happens often). Additionally, if multiple people make requests to Ion at the same time, and the cache has expired, multiple requests will be sent to that same url, causing a page hang for many users simultaneously.\n\n\n## Suggested implementation(s) (if applicable)\n- Use a celery task to check the status every 5 minutes with celerybeat. The cache should NOT expire every 5 minutes so that requests to Ion while the status is being updated still go through.",

      "title" : "[RFC] LMCache & Agentic Application/Benchmark/Workflow Traces",
      "url" : "https://github.com/LMCache/LMCache/issues/1826",
      "repositoryName" : "LMCache/LMCache",
      "description" : "## Goal\n\nCollect a set of agentic applications and workflows to demonstrate that LMCache is suitable for running agentic applications/workflows in terms of context reuse, ultimately reducing TTFT (Time to First Token) and ITL (Inter-Token Latency).\n\n## Motivation\n\nWe want to showcase that LMCache is not only limited to CPU offloading. The plan is to collect real traces to prove that LMCache can speed up inference in agentic settings. Agentic workloads typically involve multiple iterative LLM calls within a session; this pattern benefits from cache reuse. This issue is a long-lasting tracker and a call for help.\n\n## Plan\n\nA new folder will be added:\n\n```\nlmcache/examples/agents/\n```\n\nEach subfolder will correspond to a benchmark, application, or workflow:\n\n```\nexamples/agents/<benchmark_or_application_name>/\n ????????? README.md          # Brief intro to the benchmark/application/workflow and how to run it\n ????????? trace.jsonl        # Example converted trace\n ????????? converter.py       # (Optional) script to convert raw logs/outputs to the unified trace format\n```\n\n### Unified Trace Format\n\nDifferent repos log LLM calls, function calls, intermediate results, and faults in different ways. We only care about the LLM calls that reach the vLLM server, as those are relevant to LMCache.\n\n**trace.jsonl**\n```jsonl\n{\"timestamp\": 0, \"input\": \"input prompt in raw string\", \"output\": \"output response in raw string\", \"session_id\": 0}\n{\"timestamp\": 123, \"input\": \"input prompt in raw string\", \"output\": \"output response in raw string\", \"session_id\": 0}\n```\n\n- `timestamp`: relative timestamp from 0.\n- `input` / `output`: raw strings for each LLM call.\n- `session_id`: if one query to an agent executes N rounds and incurs N LLM calls, all entries share the same `session_id`. This enables overlapping different users/sessions to make the dataset more condensed. `session_id` is experimental and optional; the key fields are `timestamp`, `input`, and `output`.\n\nUnder each benchmark/application/workflow folder, include an example converted trace and, optionally, a `converter.py` to help others convert the repo???s raw outputs to the unified format.\n\n## Analysis and Visualization\n\nAfter obtaining unified traces, I will provide an analysis script to study the relationship between RAM pool size and hit rate for both:\n\n1. Prefix string match (LMCache case).\n2. Longest common substring match (CacheBlend case).\n\nThe physical meaning of the graphs is: given a unified RAM pool (GPU/CPU/Disk) for KV-cache storage, how much hit rate can be achieved.\n\nFor example:\n- If 20 GB is the spare GPU RAM after loading the model, that is the maximum hit rate achievable if only vLLM prefix caching happens in GPU.\n- If 200 GB is the maximum CPU RAM, then the hit rate difference between 200 GB and 20 GB is the LMCache gain: `gain = f(200) ??? f(20)`.\n\nWe can also annotate the x-axis with: no prefix caching ??? GPU caching ??? CPU caching ??? disk caching ??? unlimited space. This helps guide best-practice configuration for LMCache.\n\nExample figures (not good ones though):\n**Prefix Cache Hit Rate vs Pool Size (LMCcache)**\n<img width=\"1782\" height=\"1030\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06e028b6-d754-4959-90c1-727ed8321878\" />\n\n**Substring Cache Hit Rate vs Pool Size (CacheBlend)**\n<img width=\"1782\" height=\"1030\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0262840a-5ca1-4917-a416-5d9a1f67a3be\" />\n\n## Purpose of Calculating Hit Rate\n\nIf we have the hit rate, we can estimate performance gain.\n\nLet:\n- `Tp` = time to prefill,\n- `To` = time for a cache hit and offload,\n- assume `Tp = 10 ?? To`.\n- HRl: hit rate for lmcache; HRv: hit rate for vllm\n\nThen:\n```\nttft_lmcache = Tp(1 - HRl) + To*HRl = 10To - 10To*HRl + To*HRl = 10To - 9To*HRl\nttft_vllm    = Tp(1 - HRv) + To*HRv = 10To - 10To*HRv + To*HRv = 10To - 9To*HRv\n\nttft_lmcache / ttft_vllm\n= (10To - 9To*HRl) / (10To - 9To*HRv)\n= (10To - 9To*(HRv + HRdiff)) / (10To - 9To*HRv)\n= 1 - 9To*HRdiff / (10To - 9To*HRv)\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can set up a machine and replay the traces directly to observe TTFT and ITL differences.\n\n## Call for Contribution\n\nHelp is needed in this thread. The request is to run popular agentic benchmarks/applications/workflows, each within a folder under `lmcache/examples/agents`.

      "description" : "There are quite a few broken links in our site, most of which to non-existent `.md` files. The problem is that we have been using default [jekyll-relative-links](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-relative-links) plugin, which automatically converts a link to `file.md` to `file` **if and only if `file.md` exists**.

", "The CII Best Practices Badge is a web application, so it's a different circumstance than a static site. Not sure they're pro tips, but here's food for thought that I hope helps.\r\n\r\nInstead of having FILENAME-LOCALE.md, I suggest thinking about using LOCALE/FILENAME.md instead. That is, a directory for each locale. You could interpret \"no-locale\" as English (en). Rationale:\r\n\r\n1. A lot of websites show locale-specific files in the form DOMAIN/LOCALE/FILENAME, including the CII Best Practices site itself (e.g., <https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/fr> or <https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/ja>), so I think that's a more common convention.\r\n2. If your \"normal\" filename ends in a suffix + extension where the suffix looks like a locale, that would be a problem - you'd have a name collision. I haven't had any problem ensuring whole filenames look different from locales in cases where that's important, especially if I'm also matching on an extension. But I wouldn't be so certain that the last *part* of a file before the extension never matched a locale.\r\n3. If you get a lot of languages and have a lot of files, the directory clutters up with all the translations, making it hard to see what's what. Separating the locales makes it clearer what is source & what is not. Having lots of *locale* directories isn't a big deal, it's really obvious what they are :-).\r\n\r\nThat said, FILENAME-LOCALE.md will take away no birthdays :-). You can always start with that, and then move it later, if you'd like to.\r\n\r\nRemarkably I didn't find a lot of guidance for internationalizing static sites. Here's one:\r\n<https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/11/internationalization-localization-static-sites/>. Take it with pounds of salt as usual :-).\r\n\r\nStuff you probably already know:\r\n\r\n* Get started\r\n* You want *native* speakers. Google translate is great for getting the gist but it's nowhere near good human translations.\r\n\r\nA minor annoyance is dash vs. underscore when specifying region-specific locales. For the separator character, ISO/IEC 15897 uses underscore, while RFC 5646 <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5646.txt> uses dashes. For example, both agree that English is \"en\". However, in RFC 5646 format Simplified Chinese is typically marked as \"zh-CN\", while traditional Chinese is typically marked as \"zh-TW\". (I am just discussing technical markings here.) In contrast, with ISO/IEC you would use \"_\" instead of \"-\". We used the RFC (dash) version because the Ruby libraries preferred that form; lots of things \"just worked\" when we did that. However, the ISO format is justifiable; I think Java accepts both but prefers ISO (\"_\") form. For now I guess the rule is be consistent.\r\n\r\nI hope that helps...", "@kimsterv @david-a-wheeler \r\n\r\nThank you for your advice.\r\n\r\nI research other static sites example. \r\nI guess that semver.org is good example for me.\r\n\r\n**semver.org**\r\n\r\n- site\r\n   - en: https://semver.org/\r\n   - ja: https://semver.org/lang/ja/\r\n- code\r\n   - en: https://github.com/semver/semver.org/tree/gh-pages/spec\r\n   - ja: https://github.com/semver/semver.org/tree/gh-pages/lang/ja/spec\r\n\r\nI try to make translation demo site for SLSA.\r\n\r\n- Japanese site: https://kannkyo.github.io/slsa/lang/ja/\r\n- source code: https://github.com/kannkyo/slsa/pull/1/files\r\n\r\nI change jekyll config and template html files.\r\n\r\nChange summary is:\r\n\r\n- Add languages config to \"docs/_config.yml\"\r\n- Add custom header file \"docs/_includes/header.html\" to support \"DOMAIN/LOCALE/FILENAME\" path\r\n", "This is awesome!

A shared config file with (almost) all shared information, protocol parameters, and _every_ peer (including all of your own) information, as well as the relevant files relative to some directory\n2. A tiny amount of command-line arguments that: selects which peer you are; sets the basepath location for the files specified in the config.\n\nThen there would never be a need to gain agreement on args; you would always just check if you have the exact same config file (and the corresponding files in the relevant directory.)\n\n### Alternative\n\n- Let our users struggle.\n- Have an endpoint that exposes the list of options and can be used to help others configure (including reading all files into literal values)\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Todo\n\n- [ ] When all peers are specified (including yourself) work out how to distinguish yourself from others, so you don't try and connect to yourself\n- [ ] Decide which params we can put in this config file\n- [ ] Decide rough format of the file\n- [ ] Decide which (absolutely minimal) set of args we keep on the command-line\n- [ ] Decide what we want to do regarding backwards-compatibility",

Now depending on the online-type:\n  * Direct Cardano: share `--mainnet` or `--testnet-magic` directly.\n  * Blockfrost: there???s not much to share here, as they don???t prevent users from failing due to configuration mismatches.\n> Note that we already expose the ledger protocol parameters via GET /protocol-parameters, which should be used to configure `--ledger-protocol-parameters` for online mode.\n\nWith the above, the envisioned user journey to configure a hydra-node to join a party would be:\n\n1. **One participant acts as the initiator**, collecting all peers information and member verification keys (still through other means).\n2. The **initiator starts their node** with the desired mode and configuration. From this point, they can either submit the `init` transaction for others to observe or, in offline mode, specify the `--initial-utxo`.\n3. **Other participants start their nodes** using their own local configurations (e.g. `--api-host`, `--monitoring-port`, `--node-socket`, `--persistence-dir`, `--hydra-signing-key`, `--cardano-signing-key`, `--listen`), along with a new configuration flag:\n\n   * `--initiator`, which specifies the initiator???s `<host>:<port>` value.\n4. **Using the newly `--initiator` configuration**, each node queries the initiator on startup to retrieve the configuration being used, including all peer information and verification keys as JSON objects (instead of files).\n5. These **queries must be signed** using the peer???s signing key, allowing the initiator to verify the request and accept it only if it comes from a trusted party.\n6. Last but not least, note that the initiator is the responsible to assign the `node-id` configuration for each participant, possibly depending on their cardano or hydra verification-key.\n\nThis approach allows each participant to start their node with minimal local configuration and ensuring configuration consistency across all parties while reducing friction and potential errors.\n\nFinally, to support restarts (especially if the initiator goes offline), the node must obtain the party verification keys from its known `HeadParameters` (which are available upon observing `HeadInitialized`) and query the already-initialized etcd cluster to get all its peer information.\n\n> Lastly, it???s worth noting that the `--start-chain-from` configuration will be overridden with the latest observed tick persisted by each participant. This prevents a restarting node from catching up from a point too far in the past, instead resuming from the latest trusted observed state.\n\n?????? Note: This approach represents a major refactor of our node start-up module.\n" ],

      "description" : "Hi Martin,\r\n\r\nIt's me again! I haven't made any improvements to the package for a while, but I received a request from my people recently. They want to show some attractive images for publication entries on one page but no associated images on another page with the same bibtex file. I am thinking it might be necessary to call the localization files defined in two different files, say, `bibtexbrowser.local.php` and `bibtexbrowser.local2.php` for the two pages, respectively. Then within these two localization files, I can call different CSS files to display or not to display a new `bibentry_image` field, which includes an html code block to display images. \r\n\r\nWhen I looked into the `bibtexbrowser.php` code, on lines 49 and 50, the `bibtexbrowser.local.php` file is hard-coded into the function. Since I am not sure how to make it flexible to accept customized `*.local.php` files and don't know if there is an easier way to implement the requested feature, I am resorting to you to give some pointers. I guess it's trivial to you to redefine the localization file calls in a couple of lines. \r\n\r\nLet me know if you have time to implement this feature or just give me some guidelines. \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nQi",

'http://s3.localstack:4566' : null }}\"\n```\nand I get the error `Execution failed! Last error was: The URI scheme of endpointOverride must not be null.`\n\n\nThe only workaround I have right now is to duplicate every s3 usage and use a switch in tasks or a condition in triggers\n\nIt would be very useful to allow this to work because in my project, we use localstack to mock s3 in dev environment, but need no override in production\n\n\n### Environment\n\n- Kestra Version: 1.0.1\n",

On large databases, this sampling behavior means some labels and relationship types are not discovered or included in the resulting schema.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\nTo reproduce the error access the  [offshoreleaks](https://demo.neo4jlabs.com:7473/browser/?dbms=neo4j://offshoreleaks@demo.neo4jlabs.com&db=offshoreleaks) database in the [Neo4j Dataset Demo server](https://github.com/neo4j-graph-examples/demo.neo4jlabs.com?tab=readme-ov-file)\n\n- server_url = https://demo.neo4jlabs.com:7473/\n- username = offshoreleaks\n- password = offshoreleaks\n- database_name = offshoreleaks\n\n## Suggested Fix\nIn the [schema.py file ](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-graphrag-python/blob/main/src/neo4j_graphrag/schema.py#L31) , the calls to  `apoc.meta.data ` in `NODE_PROPERTIES_QUERY`, `REL_PROPERTIES_QUERY `, and `REL_QUERY ` could be updated to include the parameter:\n`CALL apoc.meta.data({sample: -1})`\nThis change would ensure that all nodes and relationships are scanned, avoiding missed labels and properties ??? especially in large databases.\n\nHowever, using sample: -1 forces a full scan of the database, which can significantly impact performance on large datasets. To provide flexibility, this could be exposed as an optional function parameter (e.g., skip_sampling=True) in get_structured_schema, so users can control the behavior based on their needs.\n\nWould you agree with this approach? If so, I???d be happy to open a PR implementing the change.",

      "description" : "\uD83D\uDC4B **Welcome to OpenCRAVAT!**  \nThis beginner-friendly task helps enhance module metadata consistency by adding optional field validation for module manifests.\n\n---\n\n## \uD83D\uDCDD Summary\nExtend the existing manifest validation system (or create a companion script) to **check for optional metadata fields** in module `info.yaml` files.\n\nOptional fields include:\n- `homepage`\n- `contact`\n- `license`\n\nWhile these aren???t required, we want to **encourage** module authors to include them to improve module discoverability and transparency.\n\n---\n\n## \uD83D\uDCA1 Description\nEach OpenCRAVAT module includes an `info.yaml` file defining basic metadata such as `name`, `version`, and `description`.  \nSome optional fields (e.g., `homepage`, `contact`, `license`) are not required but highly valuable for users and reviewers.\n\nAdding a simple validation step to flag missing optional fields as **informational warnings** (not errors) will help:\n- Encourage better documentation across modules.  \n- Standardize metadata.  \n- Support potential automated module listing or registry tools in the future.\n\n---\n\n## \uD83E\uDDED Steps to Complete\n1. Review the existing manifest validation logic (e.g., `validate_manifest.py` or similar script).  \n2. Add a new check for **optional fields**:\n   ```python\n   optional_fields = [\"homepage\", \"contact\", \"license\"]\nFor each parsed YAML manifest (info.yaml):\n\nPrint a friendly message for missing optional fields, e.g.:\n\n?????? Optional field 'license' missing in module example_annotator\n\n\nDo not fail the script ??? only show a warning.\n\nEnsure that warnings are formatted clearly (use emojis or color codes if possible).\n\nTest the script with one complete and one incomplete manifest.\n\nConfirm output is readable and does not interfere with required-field validation.\n\n---\n??? Acceptance Criteria\n\n Script identifies optional fields (homepage, contact, license) correctly.\n\n Missing optional fields trigger warnings, not errors.\n\n Works seamlessly with required field validation.\n\n Clear, consistent output messages.\n\n Pull Request includes usage notes or an update to the developer documentation.\n---\n?????? Difficulty Level\n\n\uD83D\uDFE2 Low ??? ideal for contributors comfortable with Python and YAML basics.\n---\n\uD83D\uDCDA Helpful Resources\n\nPyYAML Documentation\n---\n\n\uD83E\uDDD1???\uD83E\uDD1D???\uD83E\uDDD1 Maintainer Checklist\n\n Verified beginner-friendliness\n\n Added labels: good first issue, help wanted, python\n\n Linked to the ???Module Metadata Improvements??? milestone (if applicable)\n---\n\uD83C\uDF89 Thank you for helping improve module quality and discoverability in OpenCRAVAT!\nYour contribution makes the ecosystem easier to use for researchers and developers alike.",

Navigate to the **GitHub Actions** tab in the OpenCRAVAT repository.  \n2. Click on the **main workflow** (e.g., ???Build and Test??? or ???CI???).  \n3. Click the **????????? (menu)** button and choose **???Create status badge.???**  \n4. Copy the provided Markdown snippet (it will look similar to this):  \n   ```markdown\n   ![Build Status](https://github.com/KarchinLab/open-cravat/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)\n\n\nOpen README.md in your local clone or GitHub web editor.\n\nInsert the badge near the very top, preferably right below the project title:\n\n# OpenCRAVAT  \n\n\nCommit your changes and submit a Pull Request referencing this issue.\n---\n??? Acceptance Criteria\n\n Badge appears correctly at the top of the README.\n\n Badge dynamically reflects the current CI build status (passing/failing).\n\n Badge links to the correct GitHub Actions workflow page.\n\n README renders properly in both GitHub and the project website (if mirrored).\n---\n?????? Difficulty Level\n\n\uD83D\uDFE2 Low ??? suitable for beginners familiar with basic GitHub navigation and Markdown editing.\n---\n\uD83D\uDCDA Helpful Resources\n\nhttps://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/monitor-workflows/add-a-status-badge\n---\n\uD83E\uDDD1???\uD83E\uDD1D???\uD83E\uDDD1 Maintainer Checklist\n\n Verified that the badge uses the correct workflow file (ci.yml or equivalent).\n\n Added labels: good first issue.\n\n---\n\uD83C\uDF89 Thank you for helping make OpenCRAVAT???s CI process more transparent!\nThis small but visible improvement helps every contributor trust the build system at a glance.",

Even when using `.snapshot(delay: 1.0)`, there's no noticeable improvement in this scenario.\r\n\r\n## What \uD83C\uDF31\r\nTo overcome this challenge, it would be helpful to incorporate an option to wait before taking the snapshot. This way, we can ensure that the snapshot accounts for the asynchronous loading of images and views that emerge after a delay.\r\n\r\nExample of a view that isn't properly captured in the snapshot:\r\n\r\n```\r\nstruct DummyView: View {\r\n    @State var isButtonHidden = true\r\n    var body: some View {\r\n        VStack {\r\n            Text(\"Some text\")\r\n            Text(\"Some text with delay\")\r\n                .opacity(isButtonHidden ? 0 : 1)\r\n\r\n        }.onAppear {\r\n            DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 0.5) {\r\n                self.isButtonHidden = false\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n",

      "description" : "### Is your feature request related to a problem?\n\n- [x] Yes, it is related to a problem\n\n### Describe the feature you'd like\n\n## \uD83C\uDF1F Feature Description\n\nThis feature re-envisions the **`FAQ Handler`** as a specialized tool that leverages web search to answer general, high-level questions about the organization. It is designed to be the go-to tool for users seeking to understand the organization's mission, projects, and operational model.\n\nIt will be triggered when users ask questions like:\n\n  * *\"What is this organization all about?\"*\n  * *\"How does this organization work?\"*\n  * *\"What projects do you have?\"*\n  * *\"What are the main goals of Devr.AI?\"*\n\n## \uD83D\uDD0D Problem Statement\n\nNewcomers and potential contributors often have foundational questions about the organization itself before they dive into specific projects. Answering these questions manually is repetitive and inefficient. While a static knowledge base could work, it risks becoming outdated. A dynamic approach is needed to provide accurate, current information based on the organization's official public presence.\n\n## \uD83C\uDFAF Expected Outcome\n\nThe `FAQ Handler` will act as an automated public-facing representative, providing instant and accurate information about the organization. The expected outcome is a system that can:\n\n  * **Receive a general query** about the organization.\n  * **Dynamically search the web**, focusing on the organization's official website, blog, and public repositories.\n  * **Synthesize the search results** into a concise, easy-to-understand answer.\n  * **Provide source links** to allow users to explore the topic further.\n\n## \uD83D\uDCF7 Screenshots and Design Ideas\n\nThe workflow will be managed by the `FAQ Handler` tool, which will essentially be a specialized and intelligent implementation of a web search node.\n\nRefer Notion for preferred workflow.\n\n## \uD83D\uDCCB Additional Context\n\nBy aligning the **`FAQ Handler`** with the **Web Search** tool, we ensure a \"single source of truth\": the organization's own website and public materials. This approach is highly scalable and low-maintenance.\n\nTo make this tool effective, the primary task is not to build a database of FAQs, but to ensure that the organization's **website is well-structured and contains clear, findable answers** to these common questions. The success of the `FAQ Handler` is directly tied to the quality of the organization's public-facing content.\n\n### Record\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\n- [ ] I want to work on implementing this feature",

[SerpAPI](https://serpapi.com/) (Google/Bing wrapper),\n2. or DuckDuckGo Search API (open/free).\n\n- Fetch top 3???5 results focused on official sources.\n\n _Step 3: AI-Powered Synthesis_\n\n- Feed the top search results (title, snippet, URL) into an LLM like OpenAI GPT or Gemini using a structured prompt.\n\n- Example prompt:\n\n\"Based on the following search results, answer this user question in a concise and helpful way: 'What projects does Devr.AI work on?'\"\n\n_Step 4: Generate Final Response_\n\n- Parse the LLM output to:\n\n1. Return a clear, user-friendly answer.\n2. Include a list of cited sources.\n\n_Step 5: Integration into the Main Bot or Frontend_\n\n- Package this as a backend endpoint or a callable tool inside your chatbot/workflow agent.\n\n- Ensure it fails gracefully (e.g., no results or poor connectivity ??? fallback message).\n\n**\uD83D\uDD27 Why Me?**\nAlthough I???m new to contributing, I???m genuinely passionate about AI, developer tools, and meaningful open source work.

      "description" : "## Background\n\nThe `internal/version` package currently has **0% test coverage**. This package contains simple utility functions for displaying version information, making it an ideal target for new contributors to practice writing tests.\n\n## Why this is a good first issue\n\n- **Simple code**: Only 2 functions to test (`Info()` and `Short()`)\n- **No external dependencies**: Pure Go functions with predictable behavior\n- **Learn testing basics**: Practice table-driven tests, string assertions, and Go testing patterns\n- **Quick win**: Easy to complete and see immediate impact on code coverage\n\n## Current Implementation\n\n`internal/version/version.go` contains:\n- Variables set via ldflags during build (Version, Commit, Date, BuiltBy)\n- `Info()`: Returns formatted version information including Go version and OS/Arch\n- `Short()`: Returns just the version string\n\n## What to do\n\n1. Create `internal/version/version_test.go`\n2. Write tests for:\n   - `TestShort()`: Verify it returns a non-empty string\n   - `TestInfo()`: Verify it contains expected fields (pyscn, Commit:, Built:, Go:, OS/Arch:)\n   - `TestInfo()`: Verify runtime information (Go version, GOOS, GOARCH) is included\n\n## Example Test Structure\n\n```go\npackage version_test\n\nimport (\n    \"runtime\"\n    \"strings\"\n    \"testing\"\n\n    \"github.com/ludo-technologies/pyscn/internal/version\"\n)\n\nfunc TestShort(t *testing.T) {\n    result := version.Short()\n    if result == \"\" {\n        t.Error(\"Short() should return non-empty string\")\n    }\n}\n\nfunc TestInfo(t *testing.T) {\n    info := version.Info()\n    \n    // Verify version info contains expected components\n    if !strings.Contains(info, \"pyscn\") {\n        t.Error(\"Info() should contain 'pyscn'\")\n    }\n    \n    // Verify Go version is included\n    if !strings.Contains(info, runtime.Version()) {\n        t.Errorf(\"Info() should contain Go version %s\", runtime.Version())\n    }\n    \n    // Verify OS/Arch is included\n    expectedOSArch := runtime.GOOS + \"/\" + runtime.GOARCH\n    if !strings.Contains(info, expectedOSArch) {\n        t.Errorf(\"Info() should contain OS/Arch %s\", expectedOSArch)\n    }\n    \n    // Verify format contains expected fields\n    requiredFields := []string{\"Commit:\", \"Built:\", \"Go:\", \"OS/Arch:\"}\n    for _, field := range requiredFields {\n        if !strings.Contains(info, field) {\n            t.Errorf(\"Info() should contain field %s\", field)\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Test file `internal/version/version_test.go` is created\n- [ ] Tests cover both `Info()` and `Short()` functions\n- [ ] All tests pass: `go test ./internal/version/...`\n- [ ] Coverage increases from 0% to at least 80%: `go test -cover ./internal/version/...`\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Go Testing Documentation](https://golang.org/pkg/testing/)\n- [How to Write Go Tests](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/add-a-test)\n- Project testing guide: Run `make test` to run all tests\n\n## Getting Started\n\n1. Fork the repository\n2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b add-version-tests`\n3. Create the test file and add tests\n4. Run tests locally: `go test ./internal/version/... -v`\n5. Check coverage: `go test -cover ./internal/version/...`\n6. Submit a PR\n\nFeel free to ask questions in the comments if you need help!",

We could potentially add a new constructor which builds an instance that does not auto-finalize :)", "Hi @Geobert, I've made a slight adjustment to the API in #290 and would be super-happy if you could take a look if this solves your issue. The new function would be `Pkcs11Impl::new_unchecked` where you can pass the raw object and it would *not* be finalized.\n\nThanks in advance!", "To be honest C_Finalize should probably never be implicitly called, as it can seriously disrupt concurrent token access (or force applications to keep the Pkcs11 structure in a global indefinitely simply to avoid issues).\nThere should also definitely be a way to initialize Pkcs11 without calling C_Initialize (for the same reason).", "> as it can seriously disrupt concurrent token access (or force applications to keep the Pkcs11 structure in a global indefinitely simply to avoid issues)\n\nWhat do you mean? By using the `Arc` encapsulation (which is now done on our side but maybe soon should be done by the caller), one can pass a `Pkcs11` to different threads and be sure that it will on be finalized once, when all threads are done using it. That's what we do in the `login_feast` [test](https://github.com/parallaxsecond/rust-cryptoki/blob/2702bbaad3c6202803801361c9166d761192ff87/cryptoki/tests/basic.rs#L1465).\n\n> There should also definitely be a way to initialize Pkcs11 without calling C_Initialize (for the same reason).\n\nThat is a good point!", ">  There should also definitely be a way to initialize Pkcs11 without calling C_Initialize (for the same reason).\n\nFrankly, that has been my idea in https://github.com/parallaxsecond/rust-cryptoki/pull/290: to have a Pkcs11 object that just allows calling PKCS#11 functions in a safe way but never does any lifecycle ops (that's even in the documentation in that PR). And then another one, which does lifecycle (for quite a lot of use-cases it's sufficient and straightforward) which wraps the first one and also exposes PKCS#11 functions.", "> What do you mean? By using the `Arc` encapsulation (which is now done on our side but maybe soon should be done by the caller), one can pass a `Pkcs11` to different threads and be sure that it will on be finalized once, when all threads are done using it.

Now I understand better that our \"finalize-on-drop\" approach might not be ideal by default.\n\nI suggest then that we remove finalizing on drop but modify `finalize` to actually call `C_Finalize`. Then it would be the responsibility of the caller to finalize if they need it. We should modify our tests/examples to make sure it is finalizing as a last step.\nWe could also add a new constructor finalizing on `Drop` but not sure if it is actually wanted in real-world scenarios as you described above.\n\nRegarding initializing, one does not actually *need* to call `initialize` in order to use the other functions in this crate. One can still call it and control if the error is `AlreadyInitialised` to continue or not... If it's correct or not to expose that as an error or make it pass silently is a philosophical question... I think it's ok to say that everything which is not `CK_OK` is an error.", "It is definitely correct to expose the error, an application may behave differently (for example avoid calling C_Finalize) based on that.\n\nThe challenge is making sure applications know how to handle that error, I guess that is mostly a documentation issue unless you want to change the return type to be a triplet <Ok, Warnings, Errors>. In some ways something like that is appealing, OTOH it would be quite surprising and perhaps too disruptive to application that expect standard error conventions.\n\nAn option would be to provide a mapping function that can properly interpret if an error is basically just a warning and \"pass\", or it is an actual fatal error the application really has to handle.\n\nSomething that would be invoked like this: `.map(continue_on_warnings)?` perhaps ? \n\nOr maybe something like that is simply shown as a coding example, I am not totally sure, so perhaps do nothing and just document that some function can return errors that are fundamentally just warnings :-)", "> Or maybe something like that is simply shown as a coding example, I am not totally sure, so perhaps do nothing and just document that some function can return errors that are fundamentally just warnings :-)\n\nThat sounds like a good first step at least! And we could definitely also add an example on how that \"ignoring\" capability would look like." ],

We tried many methods and finally found that the problem was that after the workflow executed the first generation, the final frame was saved in the folder of the first frame, but it could not be read again after the second generation. I tried to use it on other computers and the problem did not occur, so I guess it was caused by some conflict with ComfyUI. I uploaded a ComfyUI version (4.28g) that can run successfully. I deleted the model retention node and workflow, and just put it back in and it works.\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1OjDBDUEkDEMZOYo2IU94kyhOFAvZYhDN/view?usp=sharing" ],

      "description" : "## Background\n\nBoth the diff_drive_controller and the mecanum_drive_controller have the tf_frame_prefix functionality which includes some duplicated code. It would help the maintainability of the project(s) if this functionality came from a common set of helper functions, without duplicated code.\n\nSteps:\n* [ ] Create PR to control_toolbox to add tf_frame_prefix-related code (ideally just a single helper function)\n* [ ] Once the previous PR is merged, replace tf_frame_prefix-related code in ros2_controllers to use the control_toolbox functions\n\nReference discussion: https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_controllers/pull/1680#discussion_r2128909515\n\n## Instructions\nHi, this is a `good-first-issue` issue. This means we've worked to make it more legible to people who either **haven't contributed to our codebase before, or even folks who haven't contributed to open source before**.\n\nWe're interested in helping you take the first step, and can answer questions and help you out along the way. Note that we're especially interested in contributions from underrepresented groups!\n\nWe know that creating a pull request is the biggest barrier for new contributors. This issue is for you \uD83D\uDC9D\n\nIf you have contributed before, **consider leaving this PR for someone new**, and looking through our general [bug](https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_control/labels/bug) issues. Thanks!\n\n### \uD83E\uDD14 What you will need to know.\n\nNothing. This issue is meant to welcome you to Open Source :) We are happy to walk you through the process.\n\n### \uD83D\uDCCB Step by Step\n\n- [ ] \uD83D\uDE4B **Claim this issue**: Comment below. If someone else has claimed it, ask if they've opened a pull request already and if they're stuck -- maybe you can help them solve a problem or move it along!\n\n- [ ] \uD83D\uDDC4??? **Create a local workspace** for making your changes and testing [following these instructions](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Tutorials/Workspace/Creating-A-Workspace.html), for Step 3 use \"Download Source Code\" section with [these instructions](https://control.ros.org/master/doc/getting_started/getting_started.html#building-from-source).\n\n- [ ] \uD83C\uDF74 **Fork the repository** using the handy button at the top of the repository page and **clone** it into `~/ws_ros2_control/src/ros-controls/ros2_control`, [here is a guide that you can follow](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) (You will have to remove or empty the existing `ros2_control` folder before cloning your own fork)\n\n- [ ] **Checkout a new branch** using `git checkout -b <branch_name>`\n\n- [ ] \uD83E\uDD16 **Apply `pre-commit`** auto formatting, by running `pip3 install pre-commit` and running `pre-commit install` in the ros2_control repo.\n\n- [ ] \uD83D\uDCBE **Commit and Push** your changes\n\n- [ ] \uD83D\uDD00 **Start a Pull Request** to request to merge your code into `master`. There are two ways that you can start a pull request:\n1. If you are not familiar with GitHub or how to create a pull request, [here is a guide you can follow](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) on how GitHub works.\n\n- [ ] \uD83C\uDFC1 **Done** Ask in comments for a review :)\n\n### Is someone else already working on this?\n\n\uD83D\uDD17- We encourage contributors to link to the original issue in their pull request so all users can easily see if someone's already started on it.\n\n\uD83D\uDC65- **If someone seems stuck, offer them some help!**\n\n### \uD83E\uDD14??? Questions?\n\nDon???t hesitate to ask questions or to get help if you feel like you are getting stuck. For example leave a comment below!\nFurthermore, you find helpful resources here:\n* [ROS2 Control Contribution Guide](https://control.ros.org/master/doc/contributing/contributing.html)\n* [ROS2 Tutorials](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Tutorials.html)\n* [Robotics Stack Exchange](https://robotics.stackexchange.com)\n\n**Good luck with your first issue!**\n",

      "url" : "https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/4153",
      "repositoryName" : "diesel-rs/diesel",
      "description" : "Diesel currently supports the postgres array types. We do not provide built-in support for [various operators and methods](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-array.html) available for these types. This is a tracking issue for adding support for these operators. \r\n\r\nThe general strategy for adding support for new methods is as following:\r\n\r\n1. Define the operator via [`define_sql_function!()`](https://docs.diesel.rs/master/diesel/expression/functions/macro.define_sql_function.html). These operators can be defined [here](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/blob/861893c28673841595805586c059bced5f314163/diesel/src/pg/expression/functions.rs#L698-L733). See the linked definition of `array_append` for an example. If there is already an existing definition, this step could be skipped. This function should have a short documentation snippet with en example\r\n2. If the function is generic, add a helper type definition [here](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/blob/6c1cb1d42eb2b3000502d67249dc3cdd76066dd7/diesel/src/pg/expression/helper_types.rs#L351-L354). Again see the linked definition for an example for the `array_append` function.\r\n3. Add a test for  `#[auto_type]` support for the newly added function [here](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/blob/6c1cb1d42eb2b3000502d67249dc3cdd76066dd7/diesel_derives/tests/auto_type.rs#L413)\r\n6. Check if compile test output is up to date by running `TRYBUILD=overwrite cargo test` inside of `diesel_compile_tests`. \r\n5. Submit a PR with the change\r\n\r\nMethod list:\r\n\r\n- [x] `array_append`: ` ( anycompatiblearray, anycompatible ) ??? anycompatiblearray`: Appends an element to the end of an array (same as the anycompatiblearray || anycompatible operator).\r\n- [x] `array_cat`: `( anycompatiblearray, anycompatiblearray ) ??? anycompatiblearray`: Concatenates two arrays (same as the anycompatiblearray || anycompatiblearray operator). *\r\n- [x] `array_dims`: `( anyarray ) ??? text`: Returns a text representation of the array's dimensions. *\r\n- [x] `array_fill`: `( anyelement, integer[] [, integer[] ] ) ??? anyarray`: Returns an array filled with copies of the given value, having dimensions of the lengths specified by the second argument. The optional third argument supplies lower-bound values for each dimension (which default to all 1). **\r\n- [x] `array_lenght`: ` ( anyarray, integer ) ??? integer`: Returns the length of the requested array dimension. (Produces NULL instead of 0 for empty or missing array dimensions.) *\r\n- [x] `array_lower`: `( anyarray, integer ) ??? integer`: Returns the lower bound of the requested array dimension *\r\n- [x] `array_ndims`: `( anyarray ) ??? integer`: Returns the number of dimensions of the array. *\r\n- [x] `array_position`: `( anycompatiblearray, anycompatible [, integer ] ) ??? integer`: Returns the subscript of the first occurrence of the second argument in the array, or NULL if it's not present. If the third argument is given, the search begins at that subscript. The array must be one-dimensional. Comparisons are done using IS NOT DISTINCT FROM semantics, so it is possible to search for NULL.**\r\n- [x] `array_positions`: `( anycompatiblearray, anycompatible ) ??? integer[]`: Returns an array of the subscripts of all occurrences of the second argument in the array given as first argument. The array must be one-dimensional. Comparisons are done using IS NOT DISTINCT FROM semantics, so it is possible to search for NULL. NULL is returned only if the array is NULL; if the value is not found in the array, an empty array is returned. *\r\n- [x] `array_prepend`: `( anycompatible, anycompatiblearray ) ??? anycompatiblearray`: Prepends an element to the beginning of an array (same as the anycompatible || anycompatiblearray operator). *\r\n- [x] `array_remove`: `( anycompatiblearray, anycompatible ) ??? anycompatiblearray`: Removes all elements equal to the given value from the array. The array must be one-dimensional. Comparisons are done using IS NOT DISTINCT FROM semantics, so it is possible to remove NULLs. *\r\n- [x] `array_replace`: `( anycompatiblearray, anycompatible, anycompatible ) ??? anycompatiblearray`: Replaces each array element equal to the second argument with the third argument. *\r\n- [x] `array_sample`: `( array anyarray, n integer ) ??? anyarray`: Returns an array of n items randomly selected from array. n may not exceed the length of array's first dimension. If array is multi-dimensional, an ???item??? is a slice having a given first subscript. *\r\n- [x] `array_shuffle`: `( anyarray ) ??? anyarray`: Randomly shuffles the first dimension of the array. *\r\n- [x] `array_to_string`: ` ( array anyarray, delimiter text [, null_string text ] ) ??? text`: Converts each array element to its text representation, and concatenates those separated by the delimiter string. If null_string is given and is not NULL, then NULL array entries are represented by that string; otherwise, they are omitted. ** \r\n- [x] `array_upper`: `( anyarray, integer ) ??? integer`: Returns the upper bound of the requested array dimension. *\r\n- [x] `cardinality`: `( anyarray ) ??? integer`: Returns the total number of elements in the array, or 0 if the array is empty. *\r\n- [x] `trim_array`:  `( array anyarray, n integer ) ??? anyarray`: Trims an array by removing the last n elements. If the array is multidimensional, only the first dimension is trimmed.\r\n- [ ] `unnest`: `( anyarray ) ??? setof anyelement`: Expands an array into a set of rows. The array's elements are read out in storage order. ***\r\n- [ ] `unnest`: `( anyarray, anyarray [, ... ] ) ??? setof anyelement, anyelement [, ... ]`: Expands multiple arrays (possibly of different data types) into a set of rows. If the arrays are not all the same length then the shorter ones are padded with NULLs. This form is only allowed in a query's FROM clause; see [Section 7.2.1.4](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/queries-table-expressions.html#QUERIES-TABLEFUNCTIONS). ***\r\n\r\nFor items marked with * the instructions above can be followed as written down\r\n\r\nFor items marked with ** (any function with at least one optional argument) it might be required to define several variants of the function via the `define_sql_type!` macro. We want to have at least one variant for each optional argument, if the argument might be commonly skipped. You need to use a different fitting function name in the definition in these cases + use the `#[sql_name = \"original_name\"]` attribute to map the function correctly\r\n\r\nItems marked with *** cannot  be implemented yet as diesel doesn't support sets yet.\r\n\r\nPlease add a comment to this issue if you plan to work on a specific method.\r\n\r\nIf there is anything unclear about how to add a support for a specific method just ask and we will try to answer your questions.\r\n",

      "description" : "## Requirements\n\nCurrently, GO Feature Flag supports nested property access in targeting queries (e.g., `company.name eq \"test\"`), but the `bucketingKey` field only supports simple key lookups from the evaluation context (e.g., `bucketingKey: \"teamId\"`).\n\n## Use Case\nUsers want to be able to use nested properties in bucketing keys, similar to how they can in targeting queries. For example:\n```yaml\nmy-flag:\n  bucketingKey: \"company.name\"  # Currently not supported\n  variations:\n    variation_A: value_A\n    variation_B: value_B\n  defaultRule:\n    variation: variation_A\n```\n\nThis would allow users to bucket users based on nested object properties in their evaluation context, providing more flexibility for feature flag targeting strategies.\n\n## Current Behavior\n- `bucketingKey: \"teamId\"` ??? Works (simple key lookup)\n- `bucketingKey: \"company.name\"` ??? Does not work (nested property access)\n\n## Expected Behavior\n- `bucketingKey: \"teamId\"` ??? Should continue to work\n- `bucketingKey: \"company.name\"` ??? Should work (nested property access)\n- `bucketingKey: \"company.object\"` ??? Does not work with nested key not being a string.\n\n## Technical Context\nThe current implementation in `modules/core/flag/internal_flag.go` in the `GetBucketingKeyValue` function only does a simple lookup:\n```go\nvalue := ctx.GetCustom()[key]\n```\n\nThis needs to be enhanced to support nested property access similar to how targeting queries work.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n1. Support dot notation for nested properties in `bucketingKey` (e.g., `\"company.name\"`, `\"user.profile.role\"`)\n2. Maintain backward compatibility with existing simple key lookups\n3. Handle missing nested properties gracefully (return appropriate error)\n4. Add comprehensive tests for nested property access\n5. Update documentation with examples\n\n## Related\nThis feature request originated from a [Slack conversation](https://gophers.slack.com/archives/C029TH8KDFG/p1761663579047779) where users expressed the need for `bucketingKey: \"company.name\"` functionality similar to how targeting queries can access `company.name eq \"test\"`.",

      "description" : "### Please describe your wishes and possible alternatives to achieve the desired result.\n\n\nLong standing issue @felix0097 raised a while ago, but we should begin a spec \"change\" process to begin to allow writing out `indices` of a CSR matrix (or CSC, although less valuable there) whose max value is checked + dtype automatically set optimally.  Nowhere are dtypes specified in https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fileformat-prose.html#sparse-array-specification-v0-1-0 so while this isn't a breaking change, it could potentially complicate things downstream.\n\nIn other words, the values in `indices` of a CSR matrix are regularly less than `max(uint16)` (because we often dont have more than 30000 or so genes) but are often written as `{u}int32/64` so allowing users to write data optimized for this fact  without breaking downstream pipelines is in our interest. The process for this would be\n\n1. Add a setting to allow this behavior via `anndata.settings.downcast_indices_in_sparse = True` or similar - I would guess the behavior would be \"take the max of the incoming `indices` optionally and then write out as the minimum needed dtype\"\n2. Write tests within `anndata` that ensure reading this data back in doesn't break cupy/scipy sparse\n3. Release with this setting as `False`\n4. Potentially in the future set to `True`\n\nThe downside/complication has been traditionally scipy sparse handling of differing `indptr` + `indices` dtypes but I think that is a manageable problem if we limit ourselves to just io here, and I imagine the performance would be better, even if the data has to be re-upcast into int32 for this compatibility issue, given the lessened io. \n\ncc @lazappi @ivirshup @keller-mark, happy to produce some dummy data for this for y'all to test.  Let me know if you are aware of any downsides here or if you have commments!",

I'm wondering if there would be enough of an improvement to justify the extra complexity.\n\nYup, aparse matrices would be cut down in size by ~a factor of 2~ ~40% on disk or so, so io would also be faster at the cost of the potential reallocation of memory. I think the tradeoff is worth it, but also there are other sparse libraries out there that aren't scipy would could in theory handle the differing data types in which case there is no tradeoff, just saved io time.", "I have no problem with this from my end, as the reduced array size should be beneficial when loading data via the network and for reduced memory usage in the browser.", "Also cc @kaizhang", "Hi all,\n\nHere are some test anndata files, have a look at the file names for the case of each file - basically, I generated files for the smallest, middle, and largest values for which `uint{8,16}` would be used under this optimization and then created tests to ensure the dtype is the \"smallest\" - I also have a smallest for `uint32` but anything larger (or the largest possible value) would blow up memory for writing an anndata object, although I'm happy to generate just the matrix:\n\n[matrices.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/23003353/matrices.zip)\n\nSo let me know if you want, for example, a CSR matrix with a billion columns whose `indices` would then be `uint32` instead of `{u}int64`.", "ping everyone!" ],

Allow that to continue to show, and open it as a new tab in a different panel.\n\nThis would be best as an option in editor settings. Curious what others think of this idea - allowing the topology view / No-code main tab to stay present and all the additional tabs for tasks, inputs etc to open to the side. \n\n\nFuture idea to be discussed internally: This could be expanded further where the topology view displays more of the things inside of the no-code editor too, like inputs, plugin defaults etc as no-code is a very visual type of building. \n\n<img width=\"1386\" height=\"1242\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc728fbc-8d08-4fcf-ba63-324d4f880bea\" />",

      "description" : "### Feature Description/Summary\n\nIntegrity check is a scenario where there is a discrepancy between the amount sent in the request and the amount received from the connector, which is checked during response handling.\n\n### Context\nIntegrity checks in a payments flow are critical for ensuring data consistency, correctness, and security when dealing with amounts between Hyperswitch and connectors like Adyen, Stripe, Razorpay, etc.\n\n### Starter Tasks\n\n- In the `handle_response` function of Authorize/PSync/Refund/RSync, you will have to call the respective functions - `get_authorise_integrity_object` for Authorize, `get_sync_integrity_object` for Payments Sync, `get_refund_integrity_object` for Refund and RSync and `get_capture_integrity_object` for Capture. \n- You would have to call these functions from `crates/hyperswitch_connectors/src/utils.rs`.\n- These functions expect `amount_convertor`, `amount` and `currency`.\n- You can take a look at this [PR](https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch/pull/8075) for reference.\n\n### Implementation Hints\n\n- You can go to `crates/hyperswitch_connectors/src/connectors/payu.rs` and call the respective integrity check function as stated above in the `handle_response` function\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Request and Response body added for each of the flows where integrity check is applied.\n- [ ] All the required GitHub checks passing\n- [ ] Formatted the code using `cargo +nightly fmt --all`\n\n### How to Test it \n\n- Hardcode the amount or currency field that is being passed to the connector different from the one you are passing in the request body\n- This way you would be able to reproduce the integrity checks error message while testing.\n\n### Mentor Contact\n\n- Tag @bsayak03 [Sayak Bhattacharya] in the comments if you have any doubts/queries\n\n### Resources \n\nHere are a few sample PRs : \n\n- https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch/pull/8075\n- https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch/pull/8049\n\n### Pre-Flight\n\n#### Have you spent some time checking if this feature request has been raised before?\n\n- [x] I checked and didn't find a similar issue\n\n#### Have you read the Contributing Guidelines?\n\n- [x] I have read the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch/blob/main/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n### Submission Process:\n- Ask the maintainers for assignment of the issue, you can request for assignment by commenting on the issue itself.\n- Once assigned, submit a pull request (PR).\n- Maintainers will review and provide feedback, if any. \n- Maintainers can unassign issues due to inactivity, [read more here](https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch/wiki/Hacktoberfest-Contribution-Rules).\n\nRefer [here](https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch/blob/main/docs/TERMS_OF_CONTEST.md) for Terms and conditions for the contest.",

      "description" : "## Feature Proposal\n\n### Target Project:  \n\nCalmHub\n\n### Description of Feature:  \nUpdate the `/calm/namespaces` response to return the `name` field as an object containing both `value` and `description` fields. This change aligns with the structured pattern introduced in [PR #1432](https://github.com/finos/architecture-as-code/pull/1432) for fields like `name` and `description` across other response types (e.g., Standards, Groups). This structure improves semantic clarity and enables richer metadata handling in UIs and clients.\n\n### User Stories:\n- As a **developer building UI components**, I want the `/calm/namespaces` endpoint to return structured name data so that I can display additional context like descriptions.\n- As a **consumer of the OpenAPI spec**, I want consistent response shapes across endpoints so that I can auto-generate more reliable client models.\n- As a **maintainer**, I want the namespace model to match others (e.g., Standard, Group), so the API is easier to understand and maintain.\n\n### Current Limitations:  \nThe `name` field in the `Namespace` response is currently a plain string, which lacks descriptive context and is inconsistent with newer API responses that return structured objects.\n\n### Proposed Implementation:\n- **Technical design considerations:**\n  - Introduce a new reusable schema (e.g., `DescriptiveName`) in OpenAPI with:\n    ```yaml\n    name:\n      type: object\n      properties:\n        value:\n          type: string\n        description:\n          type: string\n    ```\n  - Refactor the `Namespace` response schema to use this structure for `name`.\n\n- **API changes:**\n  - The `/calm/namespaces` response will change from:\n    ```yaml\n    name: string\n    ```\n    to:\n    ```yaml\n    name:\n      value: string\n      description: string\n    ```\n\n- **Data model changes:**\n  - Ensure the backend response model includes the new object structure.\n  - If needed, update any mapping or DTO classes in the application code to support the new shape.\n\n- **Dependencies:**\n  - Requires consistency with the approach established in PR #1432.\n  - Potential updates needed in any client code relying on the current shape of the `name` field.\n",

Default Chaos Hub**, there are multiple fault categories such as AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, Load, Spring Boot, VMware, etc.  \n\nWhen navigating to the **Chaos Faults** section inside the **Default Chaos Hub**, you???ll see **1 fault card** for VMware.  Currently, each of these fault cards displays the **Litmus logo**, which needs to be updated.\n\n### Required Change\n- Replace the **Litmus logo** in the **1 Chaos Fault card** with the **VMware logo**  [logo link](https://hub.litmuschaos.io/api/icon/3.22.0/vmware/vmware.png)\n- Ensure the new logo is properly sized and aligned within each fault card.\n\n## Location\nChaosCenter ???

We do not provide built-in support for [various methods](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html) available for these types. This is a tracking issue for adding support for these methods. \n\nThe general strategy for adding support for new methods is as following:\n\n1. Define the function in [this](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/blob/a641d7cc5f792412ded9ffdab3134fa473a57596/diesel/src/pg/expression/functions.rs#L20) `extern \"SQL` block. This function should have a short documentation snippet with an example (See the linked postgres documentation for examples for all of the function, please also add variants with null values, etc). If there is a `json` and a `jsonb` variant, please implement both in a single PR.\n2. If the function is generic, add a helper type definition [here](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/blob/6c1cb1d42eb2b3000502d67249dc3cdd76066dd7/diesel/src/pg/expression/helper_types.rs#L351-L354). Again see the linked definition for an example for the `array_append` function.\n3. Add a test for  `#[auto_type]` support for the newly added function [here](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/blob/6c1cb1d42eb2b3000502d67249dc3cdd76066dd7/diesel_derives/tests/auto_type.rs#L413)\n5.

Are we just ignoring optional parameters?", "@j-n-f We define several function instances for this. For the variant with no optional parameter we use the original name, for variants with optional parameter we chose a meaningful name and use the `#[sql_name]` attribute to generate the right sql. See https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/pull/4171 for an example. ", "Hello, I would like to take a stab at `json_array_elements`  and `jsonb_array_elements`", "Actually, apologies... It looks like `json_array_elements` and `jsonb_array_elements` are marked as ***. \n\nDoes\n\n> We do not want to implement them yet, they are just listed to have a complete list \n\nStill hold true? If so, perhaps I can start with `jsonb_set`", "@calebbourg That statement is still true. Resolving that will require quite a bit fundamental work on how diesel represents types. \n\nAs for jsonb_set: #4357 already implements the variant without optional argument. The variant with optional argument is still missing. You would need to declare a function with a suitable name and the right parameters for that. Afterwards you use the `#[sql_name]` attribute to set the right function name for constructing the actual query. ", "Here's the first stab.  https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/pull/4385 (apologies if that's already known. Not sure what the process is)", "Hi, I went ahead and tried to do `jsonb_insert`", "I would like to work on jsonb_path_exists, but I am not sure how we want to check the jsonpath for validity. I figure that we want to create a new datatype for jsonpath in diesel? ", "@kylittle Sorry for taking that long to answer this question. I was away for holidays.\n\nFor the [sqlite backend](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/blob/master/diesel/src/sqlite/expression/functions.rs#L239) we just accept a string/text value there. So maybe that's the easier solution here as well?", "@weiznich No worries! I hope you had a good time away!\n\nThat would be easier so I set out to do that, I could be incorrect here but it seems like this workaround will not work after some testing. It appears that postgres is more aggressive with its type-checking than sqlite. \n\nI looked at some docs and found that sqlite is happy to get a Text to this type of function. But after testing on my postgres it seems like postgres is not:\n\n```\n-- This results in a 'No matching function error' yes its a bit silly, but I think this happens behind the scenes\nSELECT jsonb_path_exists('[1,2,3]', '$[*] ? (@ > 8)'::text);\n\n-- These two it is happy with:\nSELECT jsonb_path_exists('[1,2,3]', '$[*] ? (@ > 8)');\nSELECT jsonb_path_exists('[1,2,3]', '$[*] ? (@ > 8)'::anyelement);\n```\n\nNot sure if this is the issue but this seems to imply that a new type does need to be made for the jsonpath functions albeit probably just a wrapper around a string that doesn't stop postgres from working", "@kylittle Sorry for coming back late to this. That sounds like we need to define a custom SQL type for this, like [that](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/blob/a641d7cc5f792412ded9ffdab3134fa473a57596/diesel/src/pg/types/mod.rs#L53) and then implement `ToSql<JsonPath, Pg> for String`  and possibly `&str` + add the type to the derive [here](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/blob/a641d7cc5f792412ded9ffdab3134fa473a57596/diesel/src/type_impls/primitives.rs#L96).", "i'd like to work on Jsonb_path_exist & jsonb_path_match " ],

      "repositoryName" : "diesel-rs/diesel",
      "description" : "https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/pull/4714 introduced expanded code examples for the derives provided by diesel CLI in our API documentation. See for example [here](https://docs.diesel.rs/main/diesel/prelude/derive.AsChangeset.html#input)\n\nWe would like to extend this documentation to include examples for all derive attributes supported by the various derives.\n\nSteps to implement this:\n\n1. Go to `diesel_derives/src/tests/$derive.rs` and add a new test example there as new test case. Eg. mirroring this test case: https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/blob/7a43396582924220cc45a12b2a7a1dd076150021/diesel_derives/src/tests/as_changeset.rs#L6-L19\n Make sure that the example includes the relevant attribute\n2. Run `cargo xtask run-tests all --no-doc-tests --no-example-schema-check -- -E 'package(diesel_derives) & test(#tests::*)'` and accept the newly added snapshots via `cargo insta`\n3. Verify that the output is the same for all backends.

      "description" : "### Summary\n\nAdd first-class support for layered env files and variable interpolation so teams can validate realistic setups:\n\n* Multiple files with deterministic precedence (e.g., `.env` ??? `.env.local` ??? `.env.production`).\n* Optional [`dotenv-expand`]-style interpolation (e.g., `API_URL=${HOST}/api`).\n* Clear reporting of the *effective* value and the *source file* for each key.\n\n### Why\n\nReal projects rarely use a single `.env`. Without layering, validation diverges from production behavior and misses override bugs. Interpolation is common and currently unvalidated.\n\n### Proposal\n\n#### New options\n\n```ts\nvalidateEnv({\n  schema,\n  files: [\".env\", \".env.local\", \".env.production\"], // left???right, later wins\n  precedence: \"right-most-wins\",                    // default\n  expand: true,                                     // enable ${VAR} interpolation\n  expandErrorOnMissing: true,                       // fail if referenced var is missing\n  expandDetectCycles: true                          // protect against recursive loops\n});\n```\n\n#### CLI\n\n```bash\nenv-guard \\\n  --schema schema.json \\\n  --files .env,.env.local,.env.production \\\n  --expand \\\n  --expand-error-on-missing \\\n  --expand-detect-cycles\n```\n\n#### Behavior\n\n* Load files in order; later files override earlier ones.\n* Interpolate `${VAR}` after merge, *before* schema checks.\n* On report, include `source` (which file provided the winning value).\n* Mask secret values in all output (keep existing masking rules).\n\n### Examples\n\n**.env**\n\n```\nHOST=https://example.com\nPORT=3000\n```\n\n**.env.local**\n\n```\nPORT=3001\n```\n\n**.env.production**\n\n```\nAPI_URL=${HOST}/api\n```\n\nEffective:\n\n* `HOST` = `https://example.com` (source: `.env`)\n* `PORT` = `3001` (source: `.env.local`)\n* `API_URL` = `https://example.com/api` (source: `.env.production`)\n\n### Schema sample\n\n```ts\nconst schema = {\n  HOST: { required: true, regex: /^https?:\\/\\// },\n  PORT: { required: true, type: \"int\", min: 1, max: 65535 },\n  API_URL: { requiredIf: { NODE_ENV: [\"production\"] }, regex: /^https?:\\/\\/.+\\/api/ }\n};\n```\n\n### Errors & Edge Cases\n\n* **Missing referenced var** (`expandErrorOnMissing: true`): throw with `VAR_NOT_DEFINED` and show chain.\n* **Interpolation cycle** (`A=${B}`, `B=${A}` with `expandDetectCycles: true`): throw with `CYCLE_DETECTED`, include trace.\n* **Shadowing warning**: if the same key exists in multiple files, log a note indicating overridden sources (non-fatal).\n\n### Reporting\n\nAdd to JSON/MD output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"key\": \"API_URL\",\n  \"valueMasked\": \"https://example.com/api\",\n  \"source\": \".env.production\",\n  \"overrides\": [\".env\"]\n}\n```\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n\n* [ ] Loading multiple files with deterministic right-most precedence.\n* [ ] Interpolation of `${VAR}` with optional strict missing detection.\n* [ ] Cycle detection with human-readable traces.\n* [ ] Reports include `source` and `overrides` metadata.\n* [ ] CLI flags as specified; docs updated with examples.\n* [ ] 95%+ test coverage for merge, expand, cycles, error paths.\n\n### Nice-to-have (optional in follow-ups)\n\n* Support `${VAR:-default}` fallback syntax.\n* Per-file glob patterns (e.g., `.env.*.local`).\n",

      "description" : "## Summary\n\nLevel-up GhostCache from ???TTL + storage adapters??? to a **spec-aware** HTTP cache with:\n\n1. **Conditional revalidation** via `ETag` / `If-None-Match` and `Last-Modified` / `If-Modified-Since` (RFC-7234),\n2. **SWR** (serve-stale-while-revalidate) and **stale-if-error** policies,\n3. **In-flight request coalescing** to prevent thundering herds,\n4. **Cross-context invalidation** (browser tabs via `BroadcastChannel`, Node via Redis pub/sub), and\n5. **Tag-based invalidation** (???surrogate keys???) for batch purges.\n\nThis keeps GhostCache lightweight but makes it production-grade for real APIs.\n\n---\n\n## Motivation\n\n* Honor real HTTP caching semantics to reduce bandwidth and latency while staying consistent with origin freshness rules.\n* Serve instant responses even when entries are slightly stale, then refresh **in the background**.\n* Prevent dozens of simultaneous identical requests from stampeding the origin.\n* Invalidate coherently across tabs, workers, and servers.\n* Purge whole resource groups (e.g., `user:42`, `products`) at once.\n\n---\n\n## Proposed API\n\n```ts\nenableGhostCache({\n  // Existing:\n  ttl?: number;\n  persistent?: boolean;\n  maxEntries?: number;\n  storage?: \"localStorage\" | \"sessionStorage\" | \"indexedDB\" | \"redis\" | IStorageAdapter;\n\n  // New:\n  policy?: \"ttl\" | \"http\";           // 'http' uses Cache-Control/Expires + validators\n  swr?: boolean;                     // serve stale then revalidate in background\n  staleIfError?: boolean;            // if origin fails, serve stale fallback\n  respectVary?: boolean;             // include Vary headers in cache-key normalization\n  keyFn?: (req: NormalizedRequest) => string;  // custom cache key builder\n  coalesce?: boolean;                // in-flight dedupe\n  broadcast?: boolean;               // cross-tab/node invalidations\n});\n\ntype SetOptions = { ttl?: number; tags?: string[] };\ntype InvalidateOptions = { key?: string; tags?: string[] };\n\nexport function revalidate(url: string, init?: RequestInit): Promise<Response>;\nexport function invalidate(opts: InvalidateOptions): Promise<void>;\nexport function setCache(key: string, value: any, opts?: SetOptions): Promise<void>;\nexport function getCache<T = any>(key: string): Promise<T | null>;\n```\n\n**Notes**\n\n* `policy: \"http\"` uses `Cache-Control`, `Expires`, and validators (`ETag`, `Last-Modified`) when present; otherwise falls back to `ttl`.\n* `swr` will serve stale (if within `stale-while-revalidate` window or TTL) and kick off a background revalidation.\n* `staleIfError` serves stale data on 5xx/network errors within a grace window.\n* `broadcast: true` enables:\n\n  * **Browser:** `BroadcastChannel(\"ghostcache\")` ??? `{ type: \"invalidate\", key|tags }`\n  * **Node/Redis:** Pub/Sub channel `ghostcache:events` with the same payload.\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Outline\n\n### 1) Request normalization & cache key\n\n* Normalize method, URL, sorted query params, relevant headers.\n* If origin responds with `Vary`, fold those header values into the key when `respectVary` is on.\n* Allow `keyFn` override.\n\n### 2) Metadata stored with entries\n\n```ts\ninterface StoredEntry {\n  body: ArrayBuffer | string;       // raw or compressed\n  status: number;\n  headers: Record<string, string>;\n  createdAt: number;                // ms\n  maxAge?: number;                  // parsed from Cache-Control\n  staleIfErrorSec?: number;         // parsed hint (if present) or config default\n  etag?: string;\n  lastModified?: string;\n  tags?: string[];\n}\n```\n\n### 3) Conditional revalidation\n\n* If entry is **stale** (per HTTP rules or TTL), send conditional request:\n\n  * Prefer `If-None-Match: <etag>`; else `If-Modified-Since: <lastModified>`.\n* On `304 Not Modified`: bump freshness, update headers, keep body.\n* On `200`: replace entry.\n\n### 4) SWR & stale-if-error\n\n* If `swr` and entry is stale but within grace, **return stale immediately**, then revalidate in background.\n* If origin errors and `staleIfError` applies, return latest stale entry.\n\n### 5) In-flight coalescing\n\n* Keep a `Map<cacheKey, Promise<Response>>` of active fetches.\n* Next identical request awaits the same promise; clear when settled.\n\n### 6) Cross-context invalidation\n\n* On `invalidate({ key, tags })`, remove from current store and broadcast.\n* Browser: `BroadcastChannel`.\n* Redis: simple `publish`/`subscribe` in `RedisAdapter`.\n\n### 7) Tag-based invalidation\n\n* Store `tags` per entry; maintain tag???keys index in storage adapter when feasible (for Redis easily; for browser storages keep a compact index key).\n\n### 8) Compression (optional, storage-aware)\n\n* Optionally compress large bodies for `localStorage/indexedDB` to fit quotas (e.g., browser-native `CompressionStream` when available; Node: `brotli`).\n\n---\n\n## Axios & fetch integration\n\n* **fetch:** wrap global fetch; before-hit, check entry; after-response, store entry & validators.\n* **Axios:** request interceptor to check cache; response interceptor to store; `If-None-Match`/`If-Modified-Since` headers on revalidate path.\n\n---\n\n## Edge Cases & Rules\n\n* Do **not** cache `POST`, `PUT`, etc. by default (opt-in via `keyFn` if users want).\n* Respect `Cache-Control: no-store` (never cache).\n* Respect `Cache-Control: private` in browser contexts; allow caching in app code at your own risk???document clearly.\n* `Vary: *` ??? treat as uncacheable.\n* Binary bodies: store as `ArrayBuffer` and reconstruct `Response`.\n\n---\n\n## Testing Plan (Jest)\n\n* Use `whatwg-fetch` mock / `msw` (or Node `nock`) to simulate:\n\n  * Initial 200 with `ETag`, subsequent 304 path.\n  * `Last-Modified` fallback.\n  * `Cache-Control: max-age`, `stale-while-revalidate`, `no-store`, `Vary`.\n  * Network error + `staleIfError` fallback.\n  * Coalescing: 10 parallel requests result in a single origin hit.\n  * Cross-tab invalidation (BroadcastChannel shim).\n  * Redis pub/sub invalidation in Node.\n\n---\n\n## Docs & Examples\n\n* **Guide:** ???Choosing `ttl` vs `http` policy??? with flowcharts.\n* **Recipe:** SWR in React (tiny `useGhost` hook example).\n* **Recipe:** Tag invalidation after a mutation (`invalidate({ tags: ['user:42'] })`).\n* **Recipe:** Multi-tab coherence demo (open two tabs, show instant purge).\n\n---\n\n## Backward Compatibility\n\n* Defaults preserve today???s behavior (`policy: 'ttl'`, `swr: false`, `coalesce: false`, no broadcasting).\n* New features gated by options.\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n### Core\n\n* [ ] Parse/serialize metadata; cache-key normalization with optional `Vary`.\n* [ ] Conditional requests & 304 handling.\n* [ ] SWR + stale-if-error flow.\n* [ ] In-flight coalescing map.\n* [ ] Tag index & invalidation API.\n\n### Adapters\n\n* [ ] Browser storage: tag index keys + optional compression.\n* [ ] Redis adapter: pub/sub channel + tag sets (e.g., `SADD ghost:tag:products <key>`).\n\n### Cross-Context\n\n* [ ] BroadcastChannel integration + graceful fallback (no-op if unsupported).\n* [ ] Redis pub/sub wire-up in `RedisAdapter`.\n\n### Axios/Fetch\n\n* [ ] Interceptors/patch with conditional headers.\n* [ ] Unit tests for both paths.\n\n### DX\n\n* [ ] Docs + migration notes.\n* [ ] Examples (`examples/react-swr`, `examples/node-redis`).\n* [ ] Add flags to `jest` tests in CI.\n\n---\n\n## Nice-to-have (post-merge)\n\n* **CLI**: `ghost-cache ls/inspect/purge --tag products`.\n* **Metrics hooks**: `onCacheHit`, `onRevalidate`, `onPurge` for plugging into logs.\n\n---\n",

      "description" : "Diesel currently supports the sqlite json/jsonb types. We do not provide built-in support for [various methods](https://sqlite.org/draft/json1.html) available for these types. This is a tracking issue for adding support for these methods. \n\nThe general strategy for adding support for new methods is as following:\n\n1. Define the function via [`define_sql_function!()`](https://docs.diesel.rs/master/diesel/expression/functions/macro.define_sql_function.html). These functions can be defined [here](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/tree/master/diesel/src/sqlite/expression) in a new `functions.rs` module. See the [linked definition of `to_json` for an example from the postgres backend](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/blob/a55f0fef4816602889c51fc2a403cbb20563ec2b/diesel/src/pg/expression/functions.rs#L1567-L1610) as an example. This function should have a short documentation snippet with an example (See the linked sqlite documentation for examples for all of the function, please also add variants with null values, etc). If there is a `json` and a `jsonb` variant, please implement both in a single PR. \n2. If the function is generic, add a helper type definition [here](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/blob/master/diesel/src/sqlite/expression/helper_types.rs). Again see the [linked definition for an example for the `to_json` function](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/blob/a55f0fef4816602889c51fc2a403cbb20563ec2b/diesel/src/pg/expression/helper_types.rs#L512-L515) from the postgres backend for an example.\n3. Add a test for  `#[auto_type]` support for the newly added function [here](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/blob/6c1cb1d42eb2b3000502d67249dc3cdd76066dd7/diesel_derives/tests/auto_type.rs#L413)\n5.

I had some thoughts on it and it seems like the most reasonable way of doing this would be to add support for the `#[variadic]` attribute to the \n`#[declare_sql_function]`. It may look like\n\n```rust\n#[variadic(repeated = (name, value), generate_up_to = 16)]\nfn json_insert<J: Json, N: SqlType + SingleValue, V: SqlType + SingleValue>(json: J, name: N, value: V) -> Json;\n```\n\nwhich will generate 16 functions named `json_insert_1`, `json_insert_2` ..., `json_insert_16`\n\nPros:\n- This implementation can be shared across all backends(if I'm not mistaken variadic functions for pg are also not yet implemented)\n- It will not introduce boilerplate\n- Another solution can easily be implemented later without re-writing much of the code\n\nCons:\n- Compilation time and binary size will increase due to the codegen (though it can be softened by feature-gating variadic functions)\n- Limited amount of arguments", "@mertwole I do not have a plan for that ready yet. I would like to avoid generating many more instances for these cases, so maybe we can come up with another solution.\nGiven that we \"know\" the types of the variadic arguments we could maybe just use a slice or something there to pass in the variable number of arguments? So something like\n\n```\nfn json_insert(json: J, variadic: [(N, V)]) -> Json\n```", "@weiznich What do you mean by that we \"know\" these types? All we know about the argument types is that they implement `SqlType + SingleValue`, so I suppose there're only 2 ways of passing them as slices:\n- pass `Box<dyn SqlType + SingleValue>`\n- introduce a enum containing variants for all the types supported by `sqlite` and implement `From<SpecificType>` for it (for this variant we'll lose compile-time argument type checking)", "@mertwole You are correct that won't work. Trait objects won't help there and using an enum is also not possible as this is an open set of types. You could write as of today something like `json_pretty(some_column.contcat(\"whatever\"))` and it would construct the correct SQL.\nThat written: I do not have better proposals.", "@weiznich  So maybe then approach with `#[variadic]` will fit? As I see the most functions (`json(b)_extract`, `json(b)_insert`, `json(b)_remove`, `json(b)_replace`, `json(b)_set`) can be implemented with only 2-3 variants and still be pretty usable. What about `json(b)_array` and `json(b)_object` - they can also be implemented for 2-3 variants and optionally for 16-32 variants under the feature `extended_variadic_functions`", "@mertwole Let's try the macro variant, but with the following modifications:\n\n* Default to 2 variants\n* Check for an env-variable: `DIESEL_VARIADIC_FUNCTION_ARGS` and if that's set to a larger number generate as many variants as requested. (That can be set in a `.cargo/config.toml` file per project). That should have some documentation.\n\nThat lets user easily request more parameters as they need while keeping the default overhead low.", "@weiznich Ok, you're right, this seems like a more flexible approach", "I'll also take `json_remove` and `jsonb_remove`" ],

However, Grist creates a new user and a ???Personal Team??? at domain /o/docs-{UserID} for every unrecognized user.\n\n### Describe the solution you would like\n\nEither of the following\n\n1. Users are exclusively created by GRIST_SUPPORT_EMAIL via SCIM APIs. Once user profile info is retrieved from OIDC, if user does not exist, then 403 Forbidden.\n2. Unrecognized User logs in via OIDC and a new user is created, but no personal orgs are created thus user does not belong to any org and is shown the Access Denied screen when landing on /o/docs. It'd also be important to prevent the user from creating new orgs, via UI and API. Users are added to orgs exclusively by GRIST_SUPPORT_EMAIL via API.\n\n",

Icon Size:** \nIncrease the size of the icon element itself from $18 \\times 18 \\text{px}$ to $24 \\times 24 \\text{px}$ (ideally within the existing $32 \\times 32 \\text{px}$ wrapper). If scaling the icon directly proves too cumbersome or technically unfeasible, the surrounding wrapper/class should be increased to $40 \\times 40 \\text{px}$ instead to ensure the icon has a sufficiently large visual area.\n\n**2. Hover Color:**\nChange the icon's color during the hover state to #8f95a1 (Grey 800) for both Dark Mode and Light Mode.\n\n### Acceptance Criteria:\n- [ ] The Edit Icon's visual size is increased to $24 \\times 24 \\text{px}$ (either by directly scaling the icon or by increasing the wrapper to $40 \\times 40 \\text{px}$).\n- [ ] When hovering over the icon, the color changes to #8f95a1 (Grey 800) in both color schemes (Light & Dark Mode).\n- [ ] The new size and color are implemented across all relevant pages or components that use the Edit Icon.\n\n<img width=\"387\" height=\"135\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a927806e-2f89-4045-ae59-67236d252645\" />",

The formatted value could cause issues under some certain circumstances. Therefore, a workaround is necessary to avoid any bugs from the frontEnd. \n\n## How could it affect ??? \n\nAccording to the following images, It seems backend converts 60s to 1m before it saves the value. \nFrom the front's perspective 1m is a display text only and the actual value is 60s. When retrieved, since this value does not exist, it is considered as a `custom interval`\n\nConsequently, after the page is reloaded, the user would see two 1m in the Select control. \nYou **can not see** it now because the issue has been addressed by a workaround. Ideally this workaround should not exist. \n\n\n### The PUT payload\n\n<img width=\"719\" height=\"326\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41eaed56-92f9-4463-a520-175761425a75\" />\n\n### The GET payload\n\n<img width=\"719\" height=\"255\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41da47ea-1bf4-47b8-b0ce-bbc2558f5409\" />\n\n\n\n\n",

I???m open to collaborating, splitting the workload, or deferring if you???ve already begun. Please let me know your preferred approach.\n\nI had one question while looking into the repro details: the board mentioned in the description (nucleo_f091rc) appears to only have [IWDG enabled in its DTS, not WWDG](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/0ffef90a01f3881777942c569ed6a0c3e6e39dd7/boards/st/nucleo_f091rc/nucleo_f091rc.dts#L136-L138). On the other hand, I do see WWDG enabled on these Nucleo boards:\n- nucleo_f401re\n- nucleo_h7s3l8\n- nucleo_l496zg\n- nucleo_u385rg_q\n- nucleo_l4a6zg\n\nSo the footprint issue should still be demonstrable on those, but @erwango could you confirm whether nucleo_f091rc was just an example board or if there???s a specific configuration where WWDG is enabled there that I might have missed?", "Quick correction: I found why WWDG wasn???t in the board DTS???it???s defined at the SoC level and default-disabled in [dts/arm/st/f0/stm32f0.dtsi](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/c0d973d1709981848ba3f54e933cf704e5a61e50/dts/arm/st/f0/stm32f0.dtsi?plain=1#L228-L234)." ],

It's been a very good experience so far!\r\n\r\nI took me some time to understand why my url `insteadOf` rules are not applied to higher level `Clone()`/`PlainClone()` commands. As far as I understood `insteadOf` rules are only applied to existing repositories on `.git/config` remotes. On my journey through the project I didn't find any reason to not apply global url `insteadOf` rules (i.e. defined in `.gitconfig`) to higher level `Clone()`/`PlainClone()` functions. I am using something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncloneOpts := &git.CloneOptions{\r\n\tURL: repoURL,\r\n}\r\n\r\nconf, err := config.LoadConfig(config.GlobalScope)\r\nif err != nil {\r\n\treturn err\r\n}\r\n\r\n// URL replacements would need to be done manually here\r\n\r\nstorer := memory.NewStorage()\r\nerr = storer.SetConfig(conf)\r\nif err != nil {\r\n\treturn err\r\n}\r\n\r\nfs := memfs.New()\r\nrepo, err := git.Clone(storer, fs, cloneOpts)\r\nif err != nil {\r\n\treturn errors.Wrapf(err, \"clone repository '%s'\", repoURL)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis code won't apply any `insteadOf` rules from my global config. Am I overlooking something or could url replacement be added to something like: `func (r *Repository) CreateRemote(c *config.RemoteConfig) (*Remote, error)`?\r\n\r\nThanks for suggestions and hints.",

Achieving a verified status is necessary for pull requests to be merged into the Python SDK.\n\nHowever, signing.md needs a table of contents for it to be easy to find the information you need.\nWe should also have a big clear section that warns people that commits MUST be both -s and -S signed to achieve verified status (AND your GPG key connected to your github account). We roughly explain that already but must make it absolutely clear.\n\n## \uD83D\uDCA1 Solution\nWe should add a table of contents in signing.md that points to existing sections and also add a new section called 'Achieving Verified Commits' which explains the importance and rough outline for achieving verified commits. This might require refactoring the existing document slightly.\n\nAcceptance Criteria:\n\n- [ ]  signing.md has a table of contents\n- [ ] signing.md has a new section 'Achieving Verified Commits' which replaces ## \uD83D\uDEE1??? Why Commit Signing?\nand expands on it.\n- [ ] Points to any other of our /docs documentation that is needed.\n\n\n## \uD83D\uDCCB Step by step guide to do a contribution\n\nIf you have never contributed to an open source project at GitHub, the following step-by-step guide will introduce you to the workflow.\nMore information and concrete samples for shell commands for each step can be found in our [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) file.\nA more detailed general documentation of the GitHub PR workflow can be found [here](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions/blob/master/README.md).\n\n- [ ] **Claim this issue:** Comment below that you are interested in working on the issue\n- [ ] **Wait for assignment:** A community member with the given rights will add you as an assignee of the issue\n- [ ] **Work on the issue:** Follow the detailed description in our [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) file.\n- [ ] **You did it \uD83C\uDF89:** We will merge the fix in the main branch.

      "description" : "**Describe what you are trying to solve**\nAntrea uses the `core/v1` Event API to create Events. However the `events.k8s.io/v1` API has been available (GA) since K8s 1.19, which also happens to be the minimum K8s version that we officially support in Antrea (which is a very conservative approach).\nThe \"new\" Event API introduces new fields, such as `EventTime`, and removes others, such as `FirstTimestamp` and `LastTimestamp`. There are other important changes: https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-instrumentation/383-new-event-api-ga-graduation/README.md\nEven though the new fields were added to the `core/v1` Event type (https://github.com/kubernetes/api/blob/v0.34.1/core/v1/types.go#L7440), if an Event is created through the `core/v1` API, these fields are always unset.\n\n**Describe the solution you have in mind**\nSwitch to the `events.k8s.io/v1` API when creating Events from Antrea (e.g., in the Agent's Egress controller). The new fields will then be available to Event consumers.\n\n**Describe how your solution impacts user flows**\nUsers have access to additional fields / information in the Event API.\n\n**Test plan**\nAll existing unit tests and e2e tests should keep passing.",
