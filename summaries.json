This includes the introductory paragraph and various descriptions under sections like “Get Involved” and “Resources,” which remain untranslated even though the rest of the UI is localized.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nAll static text on the “About” page should be fully translated and displayed in the selected language, ensuring a consistent and complete user experience across all supported locales.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n### Steps:\n1. Open a sketch in the web editor.\n2. Select the language other than english.\n3. Go to Help section and click on About.",

There are just a few more of these left, could you help us finish this?", "@jameslamb sure thing, all of these appear to be fixed except for the final `raises` in `test_dask.py`, which I've just opened a PR for. To help add the corr. PR in the issue [OP](https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/issues/6860#issue-2908975971) to the remaining unchecked `raises` by file:\n\n- `test_basic.py`\n   - Remaining `raises`: https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/pull/6893\n- `test_dask.py`\n   - First two `raises`: https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/pull/6893\n   - Last `raises`: https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/pull/6955\n- `test_sklearn.py`\n   - All `raises`: https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/pull/6929\n\nAlso to enforce error messages when testing for errors in the future I believe we can:\n\n- Python package: Add [ruff's `PT011`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/pytest-raises-too-broad/) to the `pyproject.toml` file\n   - Alternatively, we could enforce the entire [flake8-pytest-style (`PT`)](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/#flake8-pytest-style-pt) collection of linters, though there are currently 27 related errors so if we want to enforce this we'd have to do a little work before updating the linting config for the sake of CI checks (please see \"All PT Errors\" below). Plus, some of these are naturally subjective styling so not sure if we necessarily want to enforce them.\n- R package: Keeping track of adding this linter to `lintr` in https://github.com/r-lib/lintr/issues/2870\n   - Doesn't currently exist for [`testthat` linters](https://lintr.r-lib.org/reference/pkg_testthat_linters.html)\n   - If maintainers deem useful, I can add that in to `lintr` and afterwards update in this project and add that to the list of R linters we use\n\nSo please let me know if you'd like me to make the immediate proposed change to the python linting config (adding `PT011`) and if so, if you'd like me to do it as part of this issue or open up a separate issue.\n\n<details><summary>All PT

I apologize, looks like I was not doing as good a job of keeping the list in the description up to date as I thought. I just updated all of those and approved  + merged #6955.\n\n> _we could enforce the entire [flake8-pytest-style (PT)](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/#flake8-pytest-style-pt) collection of linters_\n> _..._\n> _ let me know if you'd like me to make the immediate proposed change to the python linting config_\n\nThanks so much for the thorough explanation. I love the idea of introducing `ruff`'s `PT011` to help enforce this stuff, and I'd support just immediately doing that (no need to create a new issue).\n\nLooks like it even caught one overly-broad exception that I missed in this issue:\n\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/blob/e7c6c4371b5d725902a09a80b4d6c36e432a4381/tests/python_package_test/test_dask.py#L1233\n\nI'd support PRs (or even a single PR, if you'd prefer) that introduced `PT` in the list here:\n\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/blob/e7c6c4371b5d725902a09a80b4d6c36e432a4381/python-package/pyproject.toml#L141\n\nThese look like some great suggestions... for example, only putting `with pytest.raises()` around the 1 statement that raises the exception is really helpful, and something @StrikerRUS has advised me on before. Would be great to enforce that automatically!\n\nBut please add the following to the `ignore` list\n\n* \"PT007 Wrong values type in `pytest.mark.parametrize` expected `list` of `tuple`\"\n  - *I do not really understand this one... a `tuple` is a little safer because it's immutable*\n* \"PT003 `scope='function'` is implied in `@pytest.fixture()`\"\n  - *I like being able to read the code and knowing it's a function-scoped fixture, not needing to remember what the default is*\n\n> _I can add that in to lintr and afterwards update in this project and add that to the list of R linters we use_\n\nThanks for opening that `{lintr}` issue.\n\nIf that idea is accepted and implemented there, I'd support using it here in LightGBM. I understand and agree with some of the concerns @MichaelChirico raised there, but for `{lightgbm}` (where our `expect_error()` tests are mostly catching our own first-party error messages), I'd like this linter's help and I'd be willing to to pay the slight maintenance cost of `# nolint` comments on any `expect_error()` calls catching errors raised by other libraries.\n\nTotally up to you if working on that in `{lintr}` interests you!", "@jameslamb Sounds good! I've opened up a PR to add \"PT\" to our linting config in #6959.\n\nI intend to work on the `lintr` issue, though I've chosen to automatically close this issue once #6959 is merged, since getting the R linter into `lintr` and having it be released in a new version so we can bump the `lintr` version in this project and use it will likely take some time, so I imagine we could specifically track that in a new issue.\n\nIf you'd instead prefer to keep this existing issue open to track the R linting config changes, just let me know!", "Thanks!\n\nYeah let's let #6959 close this issue. No need to create a new issue here for the `{lintr}` stuff, since that isn't even guaranteed to be merged... It would be ok with me if you just open a PR here in the future introducing the new linter(s) and bumping the version, similar to https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/pull/6471" ],

Some of the definitions in `interface.js` are still in use and need to be migrated to the new registration mechanism. I think it's just `crud-q` and maybe also `puter-analytics`.

      "description" : "For translation purposes, we need to replace all human-readable text in the UI components with `i18n(key)` calls. This will allow for easier localization in the future.\r\n\r\n## Tasks\r\n- [ ] Identify all human-readable text in files located under `./src/gui/src/UI`\r\n- [ ] Replace each instance of human-readable text with `i18n(key)`\r\n- [ ] Add corresponding translations for each key in `./src/gui/src/i18n/translations/en.js`\r\n\r\n## Implementation Details\r\n1. Go through each file in `./src/gui/src/UI`\r\n2. For each human-readable string found:\r\n   - Create a unique, descriptive key for the string\r\n   - Replace the string with `i18n(key)`\r\n   - Add the key-value pair to `./src/gui/src/i18n/translations/en.js`\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```javascript\r\n<button>Submit</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```javascript\r\n<button>{i18n('submit')}</button>\r\n```\r\nIn `./src/gui/src/i18n/translations/en.js`:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst en = {\r\n    name: \"English\",\r\n    english_name: \"English\",\r\n    code: \"en\",\r\n    dictionary: {\r\n        // ... existing translations\r\n        'submit_button_text': 'Submit',\r\n        // ... existing translations\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Additional Notes\r\n\r\n- Ensure keys are descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention\r\n- Be cautious with dynamic text or text that includes variables\r\n- Consider context when creating keys to avoid potential conflicts\r\n\r\n## Definition of Done\r\n\r\n- All human-readable text in files under `./src/gui/src/UI` is replaced with `i18n(key)` calls.\r\n- All new keys are added to `./src/gui/src/i18n/translations/en.js` with correct English translations.\r\n- The application builds without errors and all UI elements display correctly.",

Please describe.**\nInfinistore supports Ethernet and Infiniband, but LMCache hard-codes the link type to Ethernet when setting up its Infinistore connection. This limits the usefulness of the Infinistore backend.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nI would like to add a configuration parameter (maybe `infinistore_link` or `infinistore_link_type`) that allows choosing Ethernet or Infiniband at runtime.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nCurrently I work around this by editing the hard-coded link type value. This is not a great solution for folks who are not building from source.\n\n**Additional context**\nI am happy to make this change if maintainers agree it should be made.\n",

      "comments" : [ "+1 - we just ran into a problem related the fleet integrations when upgrading our entire stack from 8.15 -> 8.18\n\nI think because of the \"auto update\", the apm server integration got upgraded to 8.18 automatically, this broke our terraform state because it couldn't find the apm server integration 8.15.\n\nWe had to manipulate state to remove it, then found out that `terrafom import` is not supported for this resource type, so we had to manually go in kibana and delete the integration, so then terraform was able to proceed and create it.\n\nThis is really cumbersome\nIt's the first time we've ran into this because it's the first upgrade after we introduced terraform to manage our elastic stack.\n", "Plus, I'm wondering if it's even worth to have the integrations controlled by terraform, because when you bump the version, terraform tries to remove the integration and add a new one, but this fails because you cannot remove integrations that have a policy assigned to it.\n\nThis really breaks the whole point of automating this.\nAs a paying customer, I'm really disappointed that the terraform provider just seem like an afterthought, and there is really no other good alternative to maintain a bunch of elastic/kibana internal resources through IaC ", "It is a reasonable question to be asked, if it does make sense to manage the fleet integrations with Terraform. We do it for one of our setups since roughly 9 months and there are some challenges attached to it. The main reason we still do it is, that it helps us to keep everything under control between the 3 deployments (dev, test, prod).\n\nWhat we find challenging is to perform updates of the fleet integrations. We normally execute the update manually on dev and then \"backport\" the changes to Terraform by analyzing the differences in the execution plan. The main challenge there is rooted in the fact, that some of the properties (for example `vars`, if I recall correctly) are marked as sensitive in Terraform and therefore Terraform refuses to show the differences even if the property might not contain any sensitive value for some of the fleet integrations (where others actually do store sensitive values in this property). Since analyzing the differences in the JSON output of the Terraform plan became very painful (especially, since the values are JSON in JSON), we even built our own tool to assist with this (https://github.com/breml/tfreveal).\n\nThe bottom line is, that with the use of fleet integrations one faces the challange, that there are two different systems (Terraform and the install/update mechanism of Fleet), which change the state and therefore there is always drift, that one needs to handle in Terraform. Sofar we made it work, but compared with other systems, that we manage with Terraform, this is for sure one of the more painful ones." ],

This is because we did not migrate the many convenient, abstracted, and commonly used access control test methods from `ui/webapi/BaseActionTest.java` to `sqlui/webapi/BaseActionTest.java`.\n\nAfter merging #13254, all of the access control test methods in `BaseActionTest.java` have been migrated. Hence, this issue aims to refactor the unit test access controls to use these convenient test methods.\n\n## Progress\nThe progress for this refactoring can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IcB-viJMrIOknYoBYasBuRBK9qnwY0-doEK4_Eb24IA/edit?gid=0#gid=0). I (the author) will update it when completed PRs are merged proactively.\n\n## Steps to Contribute\n\n1. Choose test(s) to work on in the above Google Sheets link\n2. Check that no on else have claimed the test cases to work on within the last 2 weeks, or that it has been completed by follow up PRs (but not updated in the sheets)\n3. Comment on this issue to indicate that you'd like to contribute on the chosen test(s). Update your comment if you need more than 2 weeks so that other contributors don't overlap with your work.\n4. Create a PR to refactor the unit test(s).\n5. Submit the PR, with a link to this issue by starting the description with \"Part of #13304\"## Tips\n\n- Understand the access control test methods in `sqlui/webapi/BaseActionTest.java`, follow the refactoring in #13254\n- Most of the access control testing logic in the migrated unit tests under `sqlui/webapi` follows the old unit tests under `ui/webapi`, so you may wish to reference the old unit test for help",

Try to change it or clear the cache and restart Intellij.\n\nIf you are still unable to debug it, could you send some screenshots and videos of your steps and configurations?", "@InfinityTwo Thank u for pointing me towards Intellij configurations.

From that I am guessing your Intellij is missing something, perhaps Gradle or some other plugins that inhibits the use of testing.

And so no changes for local dev.\n\nBut given the frequency of flakey test runs, I do think it is worth it to run CI with `-count=2`. It will slow CI down, but flakey/buggy tests will likely fail checks. And if we have access to bigger build workers(?), I think that would help reduce the time (bigger workers = more CPUs = more tests running in parallel).\n\n(ill put this comment on https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/31013#pullrequestreview-2975837738 as well)\n\nThe final option would be to only run with a higher count upon merging to main.

Initially, we kept the text input for the LAM encoder in stage 2 but found that dropping it performs better. You can try both designs in your own setting to see which one works best.", "I'm very curious about this issue as well. \n- The 1st stage is called **task-irrelevant** while task instructions are provided. \n- The 2nd stage is called **task-centric** while task information is not given.\nWhat are the reasons behind those terminologies?", "Thanks for bringing this up! During the first stage of training, the strong information bottleneck created by the VQ-VAE codebook forces the learned latent actions to capture only the information not inferable from task instructions—resulting in task-irrelevant latent actions.\n\nIn the second stage, with these task-irrelevant latents frozen, the newly initialized latent actions are trained to replace the role of language, allowing them to learn task-centric dynamics.\n\nThis also explains why, in naive latent action learning approaches like LAPA and Genie, latent action tokens mostly encode motion/dynamics—since texture information is already preserved from previous frames for future frame prediction in the decoder. ", "If your goal is to learn task-relevant tokens, why not directly use contrastive learning to encode those tokens and perform a soft alignment with the text instruction features? Have you tried this approach? It seems like a more straightforward way to achieve your objective.\n", "@retsuh-bqw Thanks for your detailed explanation.\n\nTo support your claims, I think it would be helpful to demonstrate what kind of behavior the latent actions actually exhibit. Have you tried comparing them in a way similar to LAPA Figure 13? Or perhaps visualizing the reconstructions like in LAPA Figure 14?", "> If your goal is to learn task-relevant tokens, why not directly use contrastive learning to encode those tokens and perform a soft alignment with the text instruction features? Have you tried this approach? It seems like a more straightforward way to achieve your objective.\n\n@dreamcubeblock We haven't tried this approach yet, but here's our reasoning: During a task episode, the latent action should evolve over time while the language instruction remains the same. Explicit contrastive alignment could harm convergence in this case, as it may be more suitable for learning latent actions that represent the entire task rollout rather than individual steps.", "> [@retsuh-bqw](https://github.com/retsuh-bqw) Thanks for your detailed explanation.\n> \n> To support your claims, I think it would be helpful to demonstrate what kind of behavior the latent actions actually exhibit. Have you tried comparing them in a way similar to LAPA Figure 13? Or perhaps visualizing the reconstructions like in LAPA Figure 14?\n\n@JisuHann Thank you for your suggestion. While we cannot perform explicit reconstruction (since LAM operates in DINO space rather than raw pixels), we have conducted related analyses:\n\n- Figures 8 & A-1 demonstrate that latent actions exhibit semantic consistency across environments and embodiments.\n\n- Figure A-3 explores the attention patterns between latent actions and DINO features." ],

      "description" : "**1. Overview:**\n\nEnsure robust and up-to-date integration of the OpenAI API as a core LLM provider within the `voltagent` framework, utilizing the official `openai` Node.js SDK. This involves verifying support for the latest OpenAI models (GPT-4, GPT-3.5 variants), features (like tool calling, JSON mode), and ensuring the implementation aligns perfectly with the `LLMProvider` interface and `voltagent` conventions.\n\n**2. Goals:**\n\n*   Implement or verify a dedicated `OpenAIProvider` class adhering to the `LLMProvider` interface.\n*   Support core generation functionalities (`generateText`, `streamText`, `generateObject`, `streamObject`) using OpenAI models.\n*   Utilize the latest official `openai` Node.js SDK.\n*   Correctly map `voltagent` generation options (model, temperature, max tokens, tool choice, etc.) to OpenAI API parameters.\n*   Implement robust support for OpenAI's tool calling mechanism, mapping seamlessly to `voltagent`'s tool definition and execution flow.\n*   Support OpenAI's JSON mode for reliable structured output generation (`generateObject`/`streamObject`).\n*   Handle authentication using OpenAI API keys.\n*   Integrate OpenAI-specific error handling and response parsing.\n\n**3. Proposed Architecture & Components:**\n\n*   **`OpenAIProvider`:** A class (potentially existing but needing review/update) within `agent/providers` implementing `LLMProvider`. It should:\n    *   Use the official `openai` Node.js library.\n    *   Handle API client initialization (API key, potentially base URL for proxies).\n    *   Implement `generateText`, `streamText`, `generateObject`, `streamObject`, correctly formatting requests (messages, tools, model parameters) and parsing responses/streams.\n    *   Specifically handle the `tool_calls` and `tool_results` message flow for tool usage.\n*   **Provider Registration:** Ensure `OpenAIProvider` is correctly registered and selectable.\n*   **Configuration:** Allow users to select 'openai' as the provider, specify models (e.g., 'gpt-4-turbo', 'gpt-3.5-turbo'), and provide API keys.\n*   **Tool Mapping:** Refine the logic that translates `voltagent` tool definitions into the format expected by the OpenAI API's `tools` parameter and processes `tool_calls` responses.\n\n**4. Affected Core Modules:**\n\n*   `agent/providers`: `OpenAIProvider` class implementation/refinement.\n*   `agent/types`: Ensure types accurately reflect OpenAI's request/response structures, especially for tools.\n*   `ToolManager`: Interaction with `OpenAIProvider` for formatting tool definitions and handling tool calls.\n*   `Agent`/`Agent Options`: Configuration for provider selection, models, and credentials.\n*   Requires the `openai` dependency.\n\n**5. Acceptance Criteria (Initial MVP / Refinement):**\n\n*   Users can configure an `Agent` to use `OpenAIProvider` with various GPT models (e.g., GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-3.5 Turbo) and an API key.\n*   `agent.generateText()` and `agent.streamText()` work correctly.\n*   `agent.generateObject()` and `agent.streamObject()` utilize OpenAI's JSON mode successfully.\n*   Agents can reliably use tools defined in `voltagent`, with requests and responses correctly handled via the OpenAI tool calling API.\n*   Relevant options (temperature, max tokens, tool choice) are passed correctly.\n*   Integration uses the current version of the official `openai` SDK.\n*   Documentation reflects the updated/verified OpenAI integration details.\n\n**6. Potential Challenges & Considerations:**\n\n*   Keeping up with frequent updates and changes in the OpenAI API and SDK.\n*   Ensuring the tool calling implementation is robust and handles various edge cases (multiple tool calls, errors).\n*   Mapping `voltagent`'s internal state/history accurately to the sequence of messages expected by OpenAI, especially when including tool results.\n*   Handling differences in behavior or features across different OpenAI models.\n*   Cost management and monitoring token usage for OpenAI API calls.",

      "description" : "Add \"Rename\" Button for Preset Management with Popup Modal\r\n\r\n**Description:**\r\nWe need to add a \"Rename\" button between the ComboBox (for selecting presets) and the \"Delete\" button. When clicked, this button should open a popup modal asking the user to enter a new name for the selected preset. Upon confirming, the preset's name should be updated in the object (`presets.name`) and the associated file. The previous file with the old name should be deleted.\r\n\r\n**Tasks:**\r\n\r\n1. **Add the \"Rename\" button:**\r\n   - Place the \"Rename\" button between the ComboBox (preset selector) and the \"Delete\" button.\r\n   - Ensure the button is clearly labeled and fits within the existing layout.\r\n\r\n2. **Implement the popup modal:**\r\n   - Create a modal that appears when the \"Rename\" button is clicked.\r\n   - The modal should include:\r\n     - An input field for the new preset name.\r\n     - \"Confirm\" and \"Cancel\" buttons.\r\n   - The \"Confirm\" button should only be enabled if the input field is not empty.\r\n\r\n3. **Handle renaming logic:**\r\n   - Update the `presets.name` property with the new name when the user clicks \"Confirm\".\r\n   - Rename the corresponding preset file to match the new name and delete the old file.\r\n   - Ensure the file renaming is done safely, checking for any name conflicts or invalid characters.\r\n\r\n4. **Update the ComboBox selection and display:**\r\n   - Refresh the ComboBox options to reflect the updated preset name.\r\n   - Maintain the current selection in the ComboBox with the new name after renaming.\r\n\r\n5. **Test the renaming functionality:**\r\n   - Verify that the \"Rename\" button opens the modal correctly.\r\n   - Test renaming with various inputs (valid, invalid, empty, conflicting names).\r\n   - Confirm that the file is renamed correctly and the old file is deleted.\r\n   - Ensure the ComboBox updates to reflect the new name without issues.\r\n\r\n6. **Update documentation:**\r\n   - Document the new \"Rename\" functionality.\r\n   - Update any relevant sections of the user guide to explain how to rename presets.\r\n\r\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\r\n- The \"Rename\" button appears between the ComboBox and \"Delete\" button and functions as intended.\r\n- The popup modal asks the user for a new name, and the \"Confirm\" button only works when a valid name is provided.\r\n- The preset's name is updated both in the object (`presets.name`) and the corresponding file.\r\n- The previous file is deleted after renaming.\r\n- The ComboBox correctly displays the updated preset name.\r\n- Documentation is updated to reflect the new feature.\r\n\r\n**Additional Context:**\r\n- The project uses ImGui, and the modal should integrate seamlessly with the existing UI.\r\n- Ensure that renaming presets does not interfere with other functionalities like saving, loading, or deleting presets.",

Additionally, OpenAI seems to strangely bounce you back-and-forth between two equally obscure error messages if you cut-and-paste the error & ask for assistance.\n\nHey Jeremy, sure, as an example, in pyproject.toml the `tool.poetry.source` section must be an array, like `[[tool.poetry.source]]` even if you only specify one source. This makes total sense as arrays with 1 entry are completely valid.  \n\nThe confusion is that poetry will give you the error in my original message, which tells you something should be an array but not _which_ something, so the solution currently is just to review your pyproject.toml file very carefully with respect to what each tool you have using it expects.", "We already replace `data.` with `tool.poetry.` in https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry-core/blob/002aa3e16f98d21645bb9a45f698b55adc40f317/src/poetry/core/factory.py#L606-L609.\n\nWe probably have to do the same in https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/blob/aeaa3d09ce7381bf34ac7e0ac27b929841256c90/src/poetry/factory.py#L335." ],

The actions-user bot will reset the file back to previous state for the next contributor after your commit is merged. So you can just simply start working with the issue right away!*\r\n\r\n## How to get started\r\nOpen the `tasks/yaml/medium` directory from the root of your project.\r\nThen open up the `docker-compose.yml` file and once it is properly created according to the YAML syntax and the task in hand, you are done and ready to make a pull request!\r\n*Note: You can test your YAML code in a editor like [this](http://www.yamllint.com/)*.\r\n\r\n## Description:\r\n\r\nYour task is to create a `docker-compose.yml` file that describes a multi-service application. This application should contain:\r\n\r\n-   A web server running on port 8080 using the nginx image.\r\n-   A database server running on the default port using the postgres image.\r\n\r\nThe web server should have access to the database server but not vice versa.\r\n\r\n## Requirements:\r\n\r\n-   Use Docker Compose version 3.\r\n-   Specify service names, image versions, and exposed ports.\r\n-   Set up a custom network and make sure only the web server can communicate with the database.\r\n-   Use environment variables to set the database name, user, and password for the PostgreSQL service.\r\n\r\n## Example Structure:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nversion: '3'\r\n\r\nservices:\r\n  # Define your services here\r\n  \r\nnetworks:\r\n  # Define your networks here\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Evaluation Criteria:\r\n\r\n-   Valid YAML syntax.\r\n-   Correct use of Docker Compose version and features.\r\n-   Correct network setup.\r\n-   The web server should be able to connect to the database, but the database should not have access to the web server.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions and how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

It is clear that many contributors are not reading the contributing.MD or the documentation update readme. \n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nWe are a welcoming community and we would like to include all regardless of their learning methodology. Some read, others watch. So, we would like a video to welcome contributors and walk them through the basics of contributing to KubeStellar. Once completed, we can create a shortcut url and give it to anyone with a question about making a contribution. This saves everyone time.\n\n### Are you willing to contribute?\n\n- [ ] Yes, I'd like to help implement this feature.\n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_",

The actions-user bot will reset the file back to previous state for the next contributor after your commit is merged. So you can just simply start working with the issue right away!*\r\n\r\n## How to get started\r\n\r\nFor this task you need to have Python and NumPy installed. Check out [Installing Python](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge#installing-python) section in README if you need to install Python. If you already have Python installed, you can install NumPy using pip (Python's package installer) with the following terminal command:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npip install numpy\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr, if you're using Python 3 specifically and have both Python 2 and Python 3 installed, you may need to use:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npip3 install numpy\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter that you can open the `tasks/python/hard` directory from the root of the project. \r\nThen open `decision_tree.py` file and start working on your solution!\r\n\r\n![python-hard](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/assets/82566656/3fc4a704-a734-4b90-90fc-476ab367b7a1)\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nImplement a Decision Tree Classifier from scratch using Python. Do not use libraries like scikit-learn that have pre-implemented classifiers; instead, use basic libraries like NumPy for numerical calculations.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\n\r\n-   Understand the theory behind Decision Trees.\r\n-   Implement a simple yet functional Decision Tree Classifier.\r\n-   Test the classifier on a dataset.\r\n\r\nUse any freely available classification dataset. Ensure the dataset has at least 3 features and at least 2 classes.\r\n\r\nImplementation Steps:\r\n-   Write functions to calculate Gini impurity or Information Gain.\r\n-   Implement a class DecisionTree with methods for fitting and predicting.\r\n-   Implement a function to print/visualize the tree.\r\n\r\nTesting:\r\n-   Split the dataset into training and test sets and evaluate your classifier.\r\n\r\nAcceptance Criteria:\r\n\r\n-   Successfully implement a Decision Tree Classifier from scratch.\r\n-   Evaluate the classifier on a dataset, showing reasonable performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).\r\n\r\nResources:\r\n\r\n-   [Decision Trees - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning)\r\n\r\n## How to run\r\n\r\nMake sure you are in the right directory:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncd tasks/python/hard\r\n```\r\n\r\nExecute the following command to run your Python script:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npython decision_tree.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected output\r\n\r\nOutput should look similar to this:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nThe predicted class for the sample [0.4, 0.6] is 0.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the output looks correct, you are ready to make a pull request!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo work with this issue, you need to have Python installed to your local machine.\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions of installing Python and how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

When you drill, the frontend sends a new request that often lacks the full dashboard/global context (like dashboard filters or URL params) that your Jinja SQL expects, so the template renders incorrectly or with missing values. This is a known limitation and has been discussed in several issues and code reviews ([example](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/33591), [example](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/33579)).\n\nA workaround is to make your Jinja SQL more robust by using `if/else` blocks to provide default values when filters are missing, so the query always returns results and columns don't disappear. For example:\n\n```sql\nWITH calculation as (\n  SELECT count(*), country\n  FROM \"Vehicle Sales\"\n  WHERE 1=1\n  {% if filter_values('product_line') %}\n    and product_line in {{ filter_values('product_line')|where_in }}\n  {% else %}\n    and product_line = 'Classic Cars'\n  {% endif %}\n  GROUP BY country\n)\nSELECT * FROM calculation\n```\n([source](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/33591))\n\nIf your dataset relies on dashboard-level filters or variables, you may need to adjust your Jinja logic to handle cases where those are missing during drill actions.\n\nThere have also been recent changes to how Superset syncs dataset columns and processes Jinja templates, which can impact this behavior ([PR 30903](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/30903)). Make sure your configuration enables `ENABLE_TEMPLATE_PROCESSING` and that your feature flags are up to date.\n\nAt this time, there is no full workaround for preserving all dashboard context in drill-to-detail requests, but making your Jinja SQL more defensive can help avoid empty or broken results.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

Because Longhorn mutator webhook requires providing [the correct `metadata.labels`](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn-manager/blob/16f796214eb359cdb9f9efbe577a2de68144081b/webhook/resources/backup/mutator.go#L63-L67) while the doc does not mention that.\n\nThere are 2 solutions for this:\n- Simply updating the doc by adding `metadata.labels` for the example YAMLs\n- The mutator should figure out and set up the labels automatically based on the input `spec.snapshotName`\n\nNow I may prefer the latter one since this solution can both\n- provide a better user experience\n- and forcibly ask the mutator to check the volume and snapshot existence before backup creation\n\n### To Reproduce\n\n1. Create and attach a volume\n2. Create a random snapshot\n3. Apply the following backup YAML provided by the doc:\n```\napiVersion: longhorn.io/v1beta2\nkind: Backup\nmetadata:\n  name: backup-example\n  namespace: longhorn-system\nspec:\n  backupMode: full\n  snapshotName: <volume snapshot name>\n  labels:\n    app: test\n```\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe backup should be created correctly\n\n### Support Bundle for Troubleshooting\n\n```\nubuntu:~$ kubectl apply -f backup.yaml\nError from server (InternalError): error when creating \"backup.yaml\": Internal error occurred: failed calling webhook \"mutator.longhorn.io\": failed to call webhook: post \"https://longhorn-admission-webhock.longhorn-system.svc:9502/v1/webhook/mutation?timeout=10s\": EOF\n```\n\n### Environment\n\n- Longhorn version: master-head (07/02/2025)\n\n### Additional context\n\nThis issue was found by community contributor @nzhan126  when she tried to test a backup-related fix. \n\n### Workaround and Mitigation\n\nSet up `matadata.labels` for the backup YAML. For example:\n```\napiVersion: longhorn.io/v1beta2\nkind: Backup\nmetadata:\n  name: backup-example\n  namespace: longhorn-system\n  labels:\n    backup-volume: <volume name>\nspec:\n  backupMode: full\n  snapshotName: <volume snapshot name>\n  labels:\n    app: test\n```\n",

These manual steps create friction for new users and go against Docker's principle of providing a complete, automated setup experience.\n\n## Current Manual Steps\n\nAfter running `docker-compose up --build -d`, users must manually execute:\n\n```bash\ndocker exec -it samarium_app npm run dev\ndocker exec -it samarium_app composer dump-autoload\ndocker exec -it samarium_app php artisan migrate\ndocker exec -it samarium_app php artisan key:generate\ndocker exec -it samarium_app php artisan storage:link\ndocker exec -it samarium_app php artisan db:seed\n```\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nThe Docker setup should be fully automated - users should only need to run:\n1. `cp .env.docker.example .env`\n2. `docker-compose up --build -d`\n\nAfter these commands, the application should be ready to use without any additional manual intervention.\n\n",

While it is not explicitly stored in the footer, it can be estimated by analyzing the number of pages via the `OrdinalIndex` and calculating the average page size.  \n\nIt might be worthwhile to include a few functions for inspecting a column's metadata.\n\nFurther more, we can also consider add these column stats into the optimizer statistics system, stored in the `_statistics_.column_statistics` table.\n\n",

As of now, Souvlaki leaves it up to the user to change the URL depending on the platform.\r\n\r\nFor Linux, we follow the MPRIS specification, which actually doesn't say much cover art apart from what's in [here](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/mpris-spec/metadata/#mpris:arturl). It only says that local files should start with `file://` and that it should be an UTF-8 string, which is enforced by Rust. Maybe you can look in the source code of desktop managers such as GNOME or KDE, since these read the field to display it on their media player controls.\r\n\r\nFor Windows, we use the _SystemMediaTransportControlsDisplayUpdater_, which has [a thumbnail property](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.media.systemmediatransportcontrolsdisplayupdater.thumbnail?view=winrt-22621#windows-media-systemmediatransportcontrolsdisplayupdater-thumbnail). It accepts multiple formats, but we choose to create it using an URI. If setting an URL starting with `file://`, the file is automatically loaded by souvlaki.\r\n\r\nFor MacOS, you can look into [these lines](https://github.com/Sinono3/souvlaki/blob/384539fe83e8bf5c966192ba28e9405e3253619b/src/platform/macos/mod.rs#L131-L137) of the implementation. These lines refer to creating an [MPMediaItemArtwork](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mediaplayer/mpmediaitemartwork) object.\r\n\r\nI hope this is of use to you.

If unavailable (e.g., in development), default to `Cartography/dev`.\n\n**Benefits**:\n\n* Easier debugging and tracing of requests in API logs\n* Improves compatibility with vendors that expect or validate user-agents\n* Aligns with standard HTTP client practices\n\n**Suggested implementation**:\n\n* Introduce a small utility (e.g., `build_session()`) in `cartography.util` to initialize a `requests.Session` with the appropriate `User-Agent`\n* Refactor existing intel modules to use this session instead of directly instantiating `requests.Session()`",

Update the task servers to remove the manual activation and deactivation. We do need to take some care that the instantiation of the interfaces then are ordered since some subscription callbacks might depend on some publishers activation or existence. So we should be creating all exporters (i.e. action clients, service clients, publishers) before  consumers (i.e. actions, services, subscribers) -- and deactivating all consumers before exporters (inverted). \n\nOn top, in the nav2 lifecycle node, we should autoactivate if the node is already activated when an interface is created (see `nav2::Publisher` for example)\n\n",

Also the SQLAlchemy URL class has a factory method named create, which easily allows you to create the URL without the hastle of string manipulations, this is how I did it for my custom SQL operator (the one I mentioned on Slack):\r\n\r\n```\r\n    def get_url(self) -> URL:\r\n        return URL.create(\r\n            self.scheme,\r\n            username=self.connection.login,\r\n            password=self.connection.password,\r\n            host=self.connection.host,\r\n            port=self.connection.port,\r\n        )\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso see [here ](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/core/engines.html#creating-urls-programmatically)the SQL documentation concerning creating URL's programmatically: [https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/core/engines.html#creating-urls-programmatically](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/core/engines.html#creating-urls-programmatically)\r\n\r\nI see @rawwar was first mentioning this, I think this would be a good idea and would simplify code and be less bug prone.", "There is new property which intends to returns SQL Alchemy URL, current behaviour of `get_url` is ambiguous and non-all hook return SA URI here, for some of the DB there is no even SA dialects exists, so better keep `get_url` as is and step-by-step migrate to appropriate ones.

Yes we should definitly leave the get_uri method as it is (not get_url as it doesn’t exist yet) and implement a new get_url method which would then be called by the existing get_sqlalchemy_engine.\r\n\r\nYes, adding new method is the way to go. How to do it, should be proposed and discussed in the PR, we have 20+ sql providers, and I think the proposal should be complete and explain how to deal with cases that can/cannot be mapped. Also the method should explicily - IMHO - call our sqlalachemy, (`getSqlAlchemyURI` ?) and likely allow variations - from what I understand SQLAlchemy can have different URLs not only for different databases, but also for different drivers. Also some of our Connections allows to add different kinds of extras and parameters - not only hosts but other parameters that might be used and passed differently to different drivers.\r\n\r\nIf we decide to introduce a new \"standard\" method, in a product like Airflow and common API like DBApiHook, the proposal should provide answers to all the questions that users might ask in order to be mergable. It does not have to handle all of those but at least get enough error handlling and interface specification to explain what is the transition from the Connection form (in all those cases we have DBAPI implementation) -> SQLAlchemy URL.  Which variations are handled, how it should work, how to map engine args etc. \r\n\r\nI don't think it can be handled by a single implementation, it's more a scaffloiding + implementation for all the implementations and it should be designed nicely with al least a handful (if not all) implementation from the above list to be quite sure that we will be able to handle those cases. \r\n", "\r\n> Hey Andrey think there is some confusion here.

Please describe.**\nOn NixOS, process commands are always very long because everything is located in the Nix store under a cryptographically-hashed prefix (see screenshot). Even at a very high resolution (3840x1600 in my case) with btop maximized, and the left panel hidden, it's impossible to see the full command much of the time.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nI'd like to be able to specify a prefix (maybe regex) to exclude some parts of the process command. For example, instead of `/nix/store/<long string>/bin/.firefox-wrapped --name firefox`, I could configure it to just show `bin/firefox-wrapped --name firefox`.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nUsing a different distro would solve this but I don't wanna.\n\n**Additional context**\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c08d3137-e71b-492c-b81c-1c86827c9803)",

We need to add more to cover all the code in vllm-ascend, and there are several principles to follow:\n\n1. The overall file tree should be consistent with `vllm_ascend`\n2. The file name should be the original file name with a prefix `test_`\n3. Use `unittest` framework, make good use of mock\n4. The UTs are all running on cpu node, mock the function related to device to host\n\nPlease refer to the official doc on [contributing](https://vllm-ascend.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide/contribution/index.html) and [testing](https://vllm-ascend.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide/contribution/testing.html) to develop, thanks!\n### Unit tests need to add\n\n- [ ] |-- test__version.py\n- [x] |-- test_ascend_config.py\n- [ ] |-- test_attention\n- [ ] |   |-- test_attention.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_attention_v1.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_mla_v1.py\n- [ ] |-- compilation\n- [ ] |   `-- test_piecewise_backend.py\n- [ ] |-- core\n- [ ] |   |-- test_schedule_config.py @nuclearwu\n- [ ] |   `-- test_scheduler.py\n- [ ] |-- device_allocator\n- [ ] |   `-- test_camem.py\n- [ ] |-- distributed\n- [ ] |   |-- test_communicator.py @FieeFlip\n- [ ] |   |-- test_device_communicators @Agonixiaoxiao #1601\n- [ ] |   |   |-- test_pyhccl.py\n- [ ] |   |   `-- test_pyhccl_wrapper.py\n- [x] |   |-- kv_transfer @Agonixiaoxiao \n- [x] |   |   |-- test_simple_buffer.py https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1531\n- [x] |   |   |-- test_simple_connector.py https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1531\n- [x] |   |   |-- test_simple_pipe.py https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1531\n- [ ] |   |   `-- test_utils.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_llmdatadist_connector.py\n- [x] |   `-- test_parallel_state.py   @wangyanhui-cmss https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1460\n- [ ] |-- test_envs.py\n- [ ] |-- lora\n- [ ] |   `-- punica_wrapper @hongfugui\n- [ ] |       `-- test_punica_npu.py @hongfugui\n- [ ] |-- models\n- [ ] |   |-- test_deepseek_dbo.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_deepseek_mtp.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_deepseek_v2.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_qwen2_5_vl.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_qwen2_5_vl_without_padding.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_qwen2_vl.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_qwen3_moe.py\n- [ ] |-- multistream\n- [ ] |   |-- test_base.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_context.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_decorator.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_layers.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_metadata.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_ms_split.py\n- [ ] |-- ops\n- [ ] |   |-- test_activation.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_attention.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_cache.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_common_fused_moe.py\n- [x] |   |-- test_expert_load_balancer.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_fused_moe.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_layernorm.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_rotary_embedding.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_vocab_parallel_embedding.py\n- [ ] |-- patch\n- [ ] |   |-- platform\n- [ ] |   |   |-- patch_0_9_1\n- [ ] |   |   |-- patch_common\n- [ ] |   |   |   `-- test_test_patch_distributed.py\n- [ ] |   |   `-- patch_main\n- [ ] |   `-- worker\n- [ ] |       |-- patch_0_9_1\n- [ ] |       |-- patch_common\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_distributed.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_eagle.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_minicpm.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_multi_step_worker.py\n- [x] |       |   |-- test_patch_sampler.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_spec_decode_worker.py\n- [ ] |       |   `-- test_patch_utils.py\n- [ ] |       `-- patch_main\n- [x] |-- test_platform.py @zhanghw0354 https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1476\n- [ ] |-- quantization\n- [ ] |   |-- test_func_wrapper.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_quant_config.py @nuclearwu\n- [ ] |   |-- test_quantizer.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_w8a8.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_w8a8_dynamic.py\n- [ ] |-- sample\n- [ ] |   |-- ops\n- [ ] |   `-- test_rejection_sampler.py\n- [x] |-- test_utils.py\n- [ ] `-- worker \n- [ ] |-- test_cache_engine.py @machenglong2025\n- [ ] |-- test_draft_model_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_model_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_model_runner_v1.py\n- [ ]  |-- test_mtp_proposer_v1.py @machenglong2025\n- [ ] |-- test_multi_step_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_multi_step_worker.py\n- [ ] |-- test_pooling_model_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_worker.py @zhanghw0354\n- [ ] `-- test_worker_v1.py @zhanghw0354\n",

      "description" : "# GPU Support for the Ersilia Model Hub\n\n## Background\n\nCurrently, the Ersilia Model Hub does not support GPU acceleration, which limits the performance of some models — and makes others completely unusable. Models are currently packaged as CPU-only Docker images. The goal of this project is to evaluate and implement GPU support using Docker.\n\n## Goals\n\n- Demonstrate that a model can run inside a Docker container with GPU access.\n- Build the foundation to support GPU in the Ersilia infrastructure (template, CLI, metadata, CI/CD).\n- Benchmark performance between CPU and GPU runs.\n\n## Step 1: Manual GPU Docker Test (Top-Down)\n\nWe will first verify that models can run in a GPU-enabled Docker container, without relying on Ersilia's internal infrastructure (e.g., CLI or model template).\n\n- [ ] Select two test models:\n  - [ ] One **GPU-only** model (TBD).\n  - [ ] One **GPU/CPU-compatible** model (suggested: FAISS-based).\n- [ ] Set up the new GPU workstation.\n- [ ] Choose and test an appropriate CUDA base image (e.g., `nvidia/cuda:...`).\n- [ ] Ensure image size is acceptable (<~4GB ideally).\n- [ ] Run tests on:\n  - [ ] At least two local GPU workstations.\n  - [ ] One cloud instance (e.g., AWS GPU instance).\n\n## Step 2: Integrate GPU Support into Ersilia Infrastructure\n\n### \uD83E\uDDF1 At the [Ersilia Template](https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos-template) level\n\n- [ ] How should `install.yml` indicate GPU requirements?\n- [ ] If model code differs between CPU/GPU, how should this be reflected in the `framework/`?\n\n### ⚙️ At the [Ersilia CLI](https://github.com/ersilia-os/ersilia) level\n\n- [ ] Add support for `--gpu` or `--cpu` flags in the `ersilia serve` command.\n- [ ] Decide whether GPU/CPU mode should be:\n  - Explicit (user-defined via flag), or\n  - Automatic (detect from hardware?)\n- [ ] Assess: Can one image support both CPU and GPU, or do we need separate ones?\n\n### \uD83D\uDCE6 At the [Ersilia Metadata](https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos5axz/blob/main/metadata.json) level\n\n- [ ] Add `runtime: GPU` / `CPU` or similar field.\n- [ ] Consider `requirements` or `compatibility` sections if needed.\n\n### \uD83D\uDC33 On [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/ersiliaos)\n\n- [ ] Should GPU-compatible images use a separate tag (e.g., `model:gpu`) or separate repo?\n- [ ] Define tagging convention early.\n\n## Step 3: GitHub Actions & CI Integration\n\nIn the [Ersilia Model Workflows](https://github.com/ersilia-os/ersilia-model-workflows):\n\n- [ ] Detect whether a model supports GPU.\n- [ ] Build and push a GPU-compatible Docker image (using `nvidia-docker`).\n- [ ] Ensure existing workflows are not broken.\n\nIn the [Ersilia CLI CI/CD](https://github.com/ersilia-os/ersilia):\n\n- [ ] Add at least one unit test to check GPU execution (on GitHub-hosted runners or self-hosted runner with GPU).\n\n## Step 4: Benchmarking & Validation\n\n- [ ] Run performance benchmarks:\n  - CPU vs GPU execution time.\n  - Memory consumption and constraints.\n- [ ] Record any limitations or environment-specific requirements.",

For example : \n\n```nvidia/cuda:12.9.0-runtime-ubuntu24.04```\n\nThis comes to ~ 2 GB/3 GB depending on the exact CUDA and Ubuntu Version being used. \n\nIdeally run automated tests/builds for different combinations of Ubuntu (or other distributions?) and CUDA  versions. \n\n## CPU vs GPU preliminary testing\n\nA very simple test on TabPFN using a [Sci-Kit Learn Breast Cancer Dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html) showed approximately 3x-4x speed ups when GPU access to the process was enabled, compared to CPU only runs (on the Norrsken GPU Workstation).\n\nMore detailed tests using a [Dataset of approximately 2 Million Compounds](https://github.com/ersilia-os/sars-cov-2-chemspace/blob/main/data/reference_library_inchikeys.csv) showed overwhelming speed-ups with GPU Accelerated similarity searches using [FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss), the difference between search times of GPU and CPU implementations scaled/diverged with the Index size. **It is clearly worth trying to accelerate models using GPU Acceleration.**\n\nWe built indices out of Count Fingerprints of the compounds (converted the SMILES to 2048 Vectors). Cosine Similarity was used as a metric. \n\nFAISS does not support cosine by default, so we use  an `Inner Product` index and perform L2 (Euclidean) Normalisation on the vectors before adding to them to the index (or before searching), which is the equivalent of using Cosine similarity.\n\nTests were ran with index sizes of `10,000`, `100,000`, `500,000` and `1,000,000`. Nearest 100 Neighbours. \n\n### Index size 100,000:\n| Number of Searches | CPU (s) | GPU (s) |\n|--------------------|---------|---------|\n| 100                | 1       | 0.01    |\n| 1,000              | 7.08    | 0.04    |\n| 10,000             | 67.49   | 0.11    |\n| 100,000            | >350    | 1.30    |\n| 500,000            | -       | 5.50    |\n\n### Index size 1,000,000\n\n| Number of Searches | CPU (s) | GPU (s) |\n|--------------------|---------|---------|\n| 100                | 9.42    | 0.02    |\n| 1,000              | 71      | 0.10    |\n| 10,000             | 711     | 1.03    |\n| 100,000            | -       | 10.45   |\n| 500,000            | -       | 52.50   |\n\n\n\n### \n\n<img width=\"765\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e39adae0-7c06-43ba-ba5f-3da89037da02\" />\n\n_NOTE: GPUs are typically higher latency but have higher parallel throughput and memory bandwidth than CPUs. It is best to use batch queries with the CPU or GPU as this amortises the touching of index memory across all of the queries and this is when GPU speed ups are convenient. We will most likely not see any improvements in GPU search times with single queries (if anything it might be slower because of GPU overhead)._\n\n\nThe examples of inference time comparisons and a 3D plot (inference time against index and query sizes), clearly demonstrate **GPUs provide absolutely non-trivial speed ups for the right tasks.**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "# Very Heavy Index (FAISS Flat)\n\nFlat (IP and L2 for example) indices are extremely large (because FAISS only supports Float32 vectors, hence each Fingerprint vector is 32 * 2048 = 65,536 Bits or 4 * 2048=8,192  Bytes), scaling up to millions of vectors means we are dealing with indices that are 10s of GBs.\n\nTried FPSim2 but there are no benefits to GPU accelerating since it does not support batch queries (could be worth looking into CUDA Programming and tuning it to support batch queries, as it supports Sparse Vectors and Tanimoto Search on GPU)\n\n## Promising alternative to Flat FAISS Index: **Approximate Nearest Neighbour (ANN) search**\n\nMost methods for ANN require index training and parameter tuning which makes building the index more complex. We also need to ensure that the training sample is diverse. \n\nPlease note the difference between training and adding to Indices. And index cannot be trained incrementally but can be incrementally added to.\n\nMemory bottlenecks are also an issue so I first train the index and then add vectors to it incrementally in batches. (Although, it is suggested, If possible at all,  add more compute at index build time. (Especially if the index does not change a lot over time))\n\nThe following ANN methods are explored and suggested (compared to ~16 GB with a flat index of around 1.99 million Vectors)\n\n### **_IVFPQ (Inverted File Index with Product Quantisation):_** \n\n#### **_I am yet to do Accuracy tests on IVFPQ but with computational performance (inference time), models seem to enjoy GPU Acceleration speed ups similar to those mentioned above for FAISS Flat indices._**\n\nThis creates very light indices: `~93 MB for an index of around 1.99 Million Vectors`, but there might be a non-trivial loss of accuracy. \n\nNote: For some reason after the index is trained and incrementally built, FAISS takes a lot of time to write it to disk which makes it look like the process is frozen but isn't actually frozen - it goes into an \"uninterruptible sleep\" because of Disk IO, as indicated by the \"D\" state in htop. \n\n### **_HNSWSQ (Hierarchical Navigable Small World Index with Scalar Quantisation)_**\n\nTraining is reasonably fast (with GPU) but adding vectors is computationally intensive and needs to batched appropriately.\n\n#### **_I am yet to do Accuracy tests on HNSWSQ but with computational performance , HNSW seem to enjoy GPU Acceleration only with at Training time as indices are pretty compact and are VERY FAST with CPU and FAISS does not have a GPU search for this yet._**\n\nWhen choosing the strength of quantisation, there is a trade off between memory and accuracy:\n\nIndex of **1.99 million Vectors**:\n\n```\n4.63 GB (~2KB Per Vector + overhead) with a  8-Bit Quantiser while maintaining around 95-98% Accuracy^\n\n\n\n2.59 GB (~1.15KB Per Vector + overhead) with a 4-Bit Quantiser  while maintaining around 90-95% Accuracy^\n```\n\n\nAdding vectors to this kind of index is slow.\n\n_^accuracy according to official documentation and third party tests_\n", "# Metric Learning - Embedding Model\n\nAnother alternative to using vanilla flat indices with 2048 dimensional fingerprints we explore is the use of a metric learning model to create embeddings that are lower dimensions. We use these embeddings to create flat FAISS indices that are much lighter than the standard fingerprint indices (512, 256, 128, 100 dimensional embeddings vs 2048 dimensional fingerprints). We uses torch's GPU version and enjoy non-trivial speed-ups at training time, while creating embeddings and inference time (FAISS Search using a GPU index).\n\nNote: The searches are performed on a flat index, hence are exact searches, but the using of the embedding model means there is an approximation.", "We are aiming to create compound similarity search models with 4 compound libraries:\n\n- ChemDiv (100k)\n- A representative of Enamine  (~9 million)\n- DrugBank (~11k)\n- COCONUT (should be between 500k and 1 Million)\n\nWe also create a _Metric Learning Embedding Model_ out of a [reference library of 2 million compounds.](https://github.com/ersilia-os/sars-cov-2-chemspace/blob/main/data/reference_library_inchikeys.csv).\n\nFor each of the above libraries the aim is to have 3 variants of indices:\n\n- _A flat IP index with L2 Normalisation_\n    - This is going to be very large for libraries with 500k+ compounds)\n\n- _A compressed IVFPQ IP index  with L2 normalisation (FAISS compression)_\n   - This creates very light indices but as mentioned above there is a loss of search accuracy\n\n- _A flat index created with embeddings from the above mentioned model._\n   - This is lets us create indices that are lighter than vanilla flat indices and also lets us have control and confidence over the accuracy of the search (given that we are confident in the embedding model, which is arguably simpler to benchmark).\n \n", "Implemented a metric learning pipeline that creates learned embeddings from existing flat FAISS index. \n\n### Transforms 2048-dimensional fingerprints → _256/128/100-dimensional learned embeddings_ with cosine similarity\n\n### Triplet sampling: Uses existing 2M compound FAISS index for mining hard positives/negatives\n\nEvaluations: ROC-AUC, AP, distance distributions, t-SNE visualizations\n\nThe pipeline maintains L2 normalization throughout for FlatIP cosine similarity and includes model checkpointing + SMILES mapping for deployment.\n\nCreated with PyTorch + FAISS GPU.

Make this an optional feature with its own dependency group\n4. Results should include entity type, text, and position information\n5. Support custom entity patterns via regex\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n- Add optional dependency group:\n  ```toml\n  optional-dependencies.entity-extraction = [\n    \"gliner>=0.2.0\",  # State-of-the-art zero-shot NER, outperforms spaCy\n    \"keybert>=0.8.0\",  # Most accurate keyword extraction\n  ]\n  ```\n- **Library Choice Rationale**: \n  - Use GLiNER for NER based on 2024 benchmarks showing superior zero-shot performance and flexibility compared to spaCy\n  - Use KeyBERT for keyword extraction as it provides the highest accuracy among RAKE, YAKE, and KeyBERT\n- Add to `ExtractionConfig`:\n  ```python\n  extract_entities: bool = False\n  extract_keywords: bool = False\n  keyword_count: int = 10\n  custom_entity_patterns: dict[str, str] | None = None  # {\"INVOICE_ID\": r\"INV-\\d+\"}\n  ```\n- Add to `ExtractionResult`:\n  ```python\n  entities: list[Entity] | None = None\n  keywords: list[tuple[str, float]] | None = None  # (keyword, score)\n  ```\n- Create `kreuzberg/_entity_extraction.py` module\n- Define `Entity` dataclass with `type`, `text`, `start`, `end` fields\n\n**Testing Requirements:**\n- Test entity extraction on various document types\n- Test custom pattern matching\n- Test keyword extraction with different document lengths\n- Mock spacy models in unit tests\n- Test handling of missing dependencies\n- Verify performance impact is acceptable",

I don't know exactly.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. add proxy-cache plugin to a route\r\n2. run curl command with compression enabled\r\n   ```console\r\n   curl --compressed https://example.com/api/healthz -v --output -\r\n   ```\r\n4. run curl command without compression right afterwards\r\n   ```console\r\n   curl https://example.com/api/healthz -v --output -\r\n   ```\r\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\nThis is my Kubernetes resource:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\napiVersion: configuration.konghq.com/v1\r\nkind: KongPlugin\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: my-cache-1min\r\n  namespace: my-api-v4\r\nconfig:\r\n  cache_ttl: 60\r\n  content_type:\r\n    - text/plain\r\n    - application/json\r\n    - application/json; charset=utf-8\r\n  request_method:\r\n    - GET\r\n    - HEAD\r\n  response_code:\r\n    - 200\r\n  ignore_uri_case: true\r\n  strategy: memory\r\nplugin: proxy-cache\r\n```",

You can try the following methods to deal with this issue:\n\n1. Reduce the training batch size `per_device_train_batch_size: 1`\n2. Replace compute kernels `enable_liger_kernel: true` and `use_unsloth_gc: true`\n3. Reduce the maximum sequence length `cutoff_len: 512`\n4. Use DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 or FSDP to partition model weights on multiple devices or use CPU offloading\n5. Set `quantization_bit: 4` to quantize model parameters (only compatible with LoRA tuning)\n6. Use the paged optimizer `optim: paged_adamw_8bit`\n\n模型训练时显存溢出，通常是由于当前某个设备的剩余显存不足以完成计算任务。可尝试下述方法解决：\n\n1. 降低批处理大小 `per_device_train_batch_size: 1`\n2. 替换模型算子 `enable_liger_kernel: true` 和 `use_unsloth_gc: true`\n3. 降低最大序列长度 `cutoff_len: 512`\n4. 使用 DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 或 FSDP 将模型权重拆分到多个设备或使用 CPU Offloading\n5. 设置 `quantization_bit: 4` 量化模型参数（仅限于 LoRA 方法）\n6. 使用分页低精度优化器 `optim: paged_adamw_8bit`\n\n----\n\n### Unsatisfying fine-tuning results / 微调效果无法令人满意\n\nUnsatisfying fine-tuning results are usually due to insufficient training samples, leading to underfitting. You can try the following methods to deal with this issue:\n\n1. Increase the size of the training dataset\n2. Increase the number of epochs `num_train_epochs: 5.0` or steps `max_steps: 1000`\n3. Use a larger learning rate `learning_rate: 2.0e-4`\n4. Use different fine-tuning method `finetuning_type: freeze` or `finetuning_type: full`\n\n微调效果较差，通常是由于训练样本过少，导致模型欠拟合。可尝试下述方法解决：\n\n1. 增加训练数据集的大小\n2. 提高训练轮数 `num_train_epochs: 5.0` 或步数 `max_steps: 1000`\n3. 增大学习率 `learning_rate: 2.0e-4`\n4. 使用不同的微调方法 `finetuning_type: freeze` 或 `finetuning_type: full`\n\n----\n\n### Corrupted or repeated model responses / 胡乱或重复的模型回答\n\nIf this issue occurs before training, it is usually due to using an unaligned (base) model or a mismatched `template`. Please ensure an aligned (instruct/chat) model and correct `template` are used.\nIf this issue occurs after training, please check if the `template` used for training and inference is consistent. And do not forget to check if the overfitting appeared. You can try decreasing the number of epochs `num_train_epochs` and learning rate `learning_rate` to deal with the overfitting issue.\n\n若该问题发生在训练之前，通常是由于使用了未经对齐（base）的模型或不恰当的模板 `template`，请保证使用对齐后（instruct/chat）的模型和正确的模板 `template`。\n若该问题发生在训练之后，请检查训练和推理使用的模板 `template` 是否一致，同时检查是否发生了过拟合。如果发生了过拟合，请减小训练轮数 `num_train_epochs` 和学习率 `learning_rate`。\n\n----\n\n### Training hangs / 训练进程卡住\n\nIf distributed training was not enabled, please use the following command to check if the CUDA version of PyTorch is installed correctly:\n\n如果没有使用分布式训练，请使用下述命令检查 CUDA 版本的 PyTorch 是否被正确安装：\n\n```bash\npython -c \"import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())\"\n```\n\nIf distributed training was enabled, try setting the environment variable `export NCCL_P2P_LEVEL=NVL`.\n\n如果使用了分布式训练，请尝试设置环境变量 `export NCCL_P2P_LEVEL=NVL`。\n\n----\n\n### LLaMA Board cannot display datasets / LLaMA Board 无法显示数据集\n\nPlease ensure that the working directory when launching the LLaMA Board is the same as the LLaMA-Factory directory.\n\n请确保启动 LLaMA Board 时的工作目录与 LLaMA-Factory 主目录一致。\n\n----\n\n### How to shard model weights on multiple devices / 如何模型权重拆分到多个设备上\n\nDuring the training phase, please refer to the [examples](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory/blob/main/examples/README.md#supervised-fine-tuning-with-deepspeed-zero-3-weight-sharding) about how to use the DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 (recommended) or FSDP.\nDuring the inference phase, please use vLLM to enable the tensor parallelism: [examples](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory/tree/main/examples#inferring-lora-fine-tuned-models).\n\n在训练阶段，请参考 [examples](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory/blob/main/examples/README_zh.md#%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8-deepspeed-zero-3-%E5%B9%B3%E5%9D%87%E5%88%86%E9%85%8D%E6%98%BE%E5%AD%98) 使用 DeepSpeed ZeRO-3（推荐）或 FSDP。\n在推理阶段，请使用 vLLM 来开启张量并行：[examples](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory/blob/main/examples/README_zh.md#%E6%8E%A8%E7%90%86-lora-%E6%A8%A1%E5%9E%8B).\n\n----\n\n### How to use ORPO or SimPO / 如何使用 ORPO 或 SimPO\n\nModify the `pref_loss` in [example script](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory/blob/main/examples/train_lora/llama3_lora_dpo.yaml) to `orpo` or `simpo`.\n\n将[示例脚本](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory/blob/main/examples/train_lora/llama3_lora_dpo.yaml) 中的 `pref_loss` 改为 `orpo` 或 `simpo`。\n\n----\n\n### How to debug with VSCode / 如何用 VSCode 调试程序\n\nSee #5337\n\n----\n\n### Why the number of examples is small in pre-training / 为什么预训练样本数比实际的少\n\nWe automatically use packing in pre-training, where we concatenate multiple samples into one sequence, so the number of examples displayed is less than the actual number.\n\n我们在预训练时候自动使用了 Packing，将多个样本打包成一条序列，因此显示的样本数量会比实际的少。\n\n----\n\n### Will the training data be shuffled / 训练数据是否会被打乱\n\nLLaMA-Factory will randomly shuffle the training data by default. You can use `disable_shuffling` to turn off the shuffling.\n\nLLaMA-Factory 默认会随机打乱训练数据，可使用 `disable_shuffling` 关闭打乱。\n\n----\n\n### How to enable streaming / 如何启用流式数据读取\n\nWe recommend shuffling the dataset before training if you want to use streaming. Add the following arguments to your yaml file.\n\n如果您希望使用流式数据读取，请在训练前手动打乱数据。将下面的参数添加到 YAML 文件中。\n\n```yaml\nbuffer_size: 128\npreprocessing_batch_size: 128\nstreaming: true\naccelerator_config:\n  dispatch_batches: false\n```\n\n----\n\n### How to resolve `Processor was not found` / 如何解决 `Processor was not found`\n\nPlease run the following code and paste the full error log to Issue.\n\n请运行下面的代码并粘贴完整报错信息到 Issue。\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoProcessor\nprocessor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(\"path-to-your-model\")\n```\n\n----\n\n> [!TIP]\n> If the problems still exist with the **latest** code, please create an issue.\n> 若使用**最新的**代码仍然无法解决问题，请创建一个 issue。\n",

Press any key, app crashes with error `Cannot destructure property 'value' of 'params.props' as it is undefined.`\n\nNote that if you set `age` column's `preProcessEditCellProps` to just return `return params;`, it still crashes but now you get internal datagrid error:\n```ts\nCannot read properties of undefined (reading 'value')\n    at eval (https://2rmfqs.csb.app/node_modules/\nmui/x-data-grid/esm/hooks/features/editing/useGridRowEditing.js:374:44\n```\n\n\n### Current behavior\n\nIf column definition has\n1. `preProcessEditCellProps` defined\n2. `editable: true`\n\nand column cell is set as non-editable by DataGrid prop `isCellEditable` returning `false` for that field, `preProcessEditCellProps` is still called if user edits any cell by starting typing on cell before edit mode is activated.\n\nThis results in `params.props` being undefined (in `preProcessEditCellProps`) and causes app to crash.\n\nThis is extension of recently fixed bug https://github.com/mui/mui-x/issues/17298 \n\n### Expected behavior\n\n`preProcessEditCellProps` should not be called for the column if the cell in question is disabled via DataGrid's `isCellEditable` prop, even if column itself has `editable: true` set (I believe cell editability should have higher priority than column editability)\n\n### Context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Your environment\n\n<details>\n  <summary><code>npx @mui/envinfo</code></summary>\n\n```\n System:\n    OS: macOS 15.4.1\n  Binaries:\n    Node: 20.18.1 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v20.18.1/bin/node\n    npm: 10.8.2 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v20.18.1/bin/npm\n    pnpm: 10.10.0 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v20.18.1/bin/pnpm\n  Browsers:\n    Chrome: 136.0.7103.93\n    Edge: 136.0.3240.64\n    Safari: 18.4\n  npmPackages:\n    @emotion/react: ^11.13.3 => 11.13.3 \n    @emotion/styled: ^11.11.0 => 11.11.0 \n    @mui/core-downloads-tracker:  5.16.14 \n    @mui/icons-material: ^5.16.4 => 5.16.4 \n    @mui/material: ^5.16.14 => 5.16.14 \n    @mui/private-theming:  5.16.14 \n    @mui/styled-engine:  5.16.14 \n    @mui/system:  5.16.14 \n    @mui/types:  7.2.16 \n    @mui/utils:  5.16.14 \n    @mui/x-charts:  7.23.0 \n    @mui/x-charts-pro: ^7.23.0 => 7.23.0 \n    @mui/x-charts-vendor:  7.20.0 \n    @mui/x-data-grid:  7.29.3 \n    @mui/x-data-grid-premium: ^7.29.3 => 7.29.3 \n    @mui/x-data-grid-pro:  7.29.3 \n    @mui/x-date-pickers: ^7.28.0 => 7.28.0 \n    @mui/x-internals:  7.21.0 \n    @mui/x-license: ^7.26.0 => 7.29.1 \n    @mui/x-tree-view: ^7.22.1 => 7.22.1 \n    @types/react: ^17.0.75 => 17.0.76 \n    react: ^18.2.0 => 18.2.0 \n    react-dom: ^18.2.0 => 18.2.0 \n    styled-components: ^5.3.9 => 5.3.9 \n    typescript: ^5.7.3 => 5.7.3 \n```\n</details>\n\n\n\n**Search keywords**: datagrid preprocessEditCellProps isCellEditable",

The theme logic in this repo only loads Mermaid scripts if `.Site.Params.mermaid.enable` is set, so the specific `var params = null` TypeError cannot occur here. Your Mermaid diagrams are not rendering because the required config is missing, not due to the upstream bug.\n\nTo fix Mermaid rendering, add this to your `config.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[params.mermaid]\nenable = true\n\n[markup]\n  [markup.highlight]\n    guessSyntax = false\n```\n\nThis will enable Mermaid support and ensure diagrams render as expected.

I guess in theory if we're really careful about the lookup logic (and the KVStore is async) we could do the loading in parallel (though its still a few more requests) but we'd still have to wait on compaction (without a background-compaction task running, which would require a generic `spawn` method...). Seems much easier to just check the length and skip some code for the common case :)", "If I understand it correctly, this is special casing for channels at the beginning of their life and when they grow, the node will switch over to persisting updates and compaction anyway?\n\nTo me it isn't quite clear if this is really worth it. If the hit is significant, it is also a problem when the channel has outgrown the 'small' stage anyway?", "> If I understand it correctly, this is special casing for channels at the beginning of their life and when they grow, the node will switch over to persisting updates and compaction anyway?\n\nYes.\n\n> To me it isn't quite clear if this is really worth it. If the hit is significant, it is also a problem when the channel has outgrown the 'small' stage anyway?\n\nIts more a recognition of two very different cases - if you're running an \"edge node\" that is just a wallet making occasional payments, then you're likely to never hit the \"large\" stage, and thus avoiding the compaction overhead is a really nice optimization. If you're a larger node that is forwarding/processing many payments, you're very likely to hit the \"large\" stage and the compaction penalty is worth it to avoid the writes.", "At what size would the \"large\" stage be entered then typically and how many htlcs/channel updates is that? A channel monitor of a few kb, that doesn't sound like all that many updates?", "Yea, dunno, we'd have to figure that out. I imagine most mobile nodes probably make in the 100s to low 1000s of payments in their entire lifetime, probably fewer on a single channel once you consider splicing and the like. 10KiB or whatever should be plenty for 100 or 250 payments.", "> Its more a recognition of two very different cases\n\nIt sounds like if you wanted to make this automatic, the metric you'd really want to evaluate to switch this behavior isn't so much monitor size, as one of these:\n\n  - Frequency of updates to the channel\n  - Latency of updates to the channel (more difficult)\n\nThe monitor size is a decent reflection of the _number_ of updates to the channel[1], but with no perception of time it's impossible to evaluate whether it's being stored by a tenured edge node, or a routing node. I think if you took time into account, perhaps by using the block delta between the funding tx and chain tip to estimate update frequency, you could make a more informed assessment.\n\nHowever, I worry that automating the behavior selection is not really following the \"principle of least astonishment.\" \n\nI would think that routing nodes rarely move to the edge, and edge nodes rarely become routing nodes (more often, a routing node starts small and may appear like an edge). And furthermore, I know what my node is likely to be; especially if I'm a Lightning developer and managing this on behalf of users, such as in a mobile wallet.\n\nFor that matter, varying the behavior _per channel_ seems to make node persistence more difficult to reason about. Different channels could persist different ways on my node, depending on a size threshold. Which means they can change without me doing anything. I would think that if the reason for variation is the use case, then one behavior is correct for all channels stored by the node.\n\nIn that light, I'd just leave this a configurable behavior, which I think it is now.\n\n[1] I recognize that size is being used here to evaluate the storage write size, not the number of updates. But I think that is why the discussion is unclear. Compared to update count/frequency, it's much harder to know the storage configuration of a given node, and what the throughput/latency tradeoff is like.", "I think the intent of the proposed change is to optimize for the edge-node case with remote storage. Even an edge node may make enough payments to get a monitor up to 10s of KiB in size, at which point network-level effects like TCP slowstart may dominate the actual network latency. For a \"power-user\" edge node, we really want to use the `MonitorUpdatingPersister`, but paying the extra RTT cost of cleanup on load for every edge node is not a great tradeoff either.\n\nFor a routing node, it still seems to me like a size-based threshold may be something they want, purely as it (very marginally) reduces IO throughput for under-utilized or new channels. Writing out updates (padded to 4KiB or more depending on the storage medium) and then consolidating when the whole monitor is only a few KiB isn't really the right tradeoff no matter what. Of course a routing node is expected to surpass the threshold very quickly, so it shouldn't really make a substantial difference, but it seems strictly better to write out full updates in this case than not.\n\nIndeed, this does lead to a bit of behavior shift, but I think the important metrics wouldn't change - first of all, if you happened to look at storage right after compaction, the stored contents would be identical to a full monitor persistence so I wouldn't really say that this materially changes the way that logic would interact with the stored data (you already have to handle the case of having no in-flight updates!). It also shouldn't materially change the IO throughput or write count for any node, just a fairly marginal strict reduction for routing nodes with fresh channels.", "> At what size would the \"large\" stage be entered then typically and how many htlcs/channel updates is that? A channel monitor of a few kb, that doesn't sound like all that many updates?\n\nFor our probing node running ldk-node with network storage (EFS), at around 20,000 updates over the single channel the average probe duration starts to increase substantially. p75 starts to creep up after about 3,000.", "Do y'all have any further thoughts here, @domZippilli or @amackillop?", "> Do y'all have any further thoughts here, [@domZippilli](https://github.com/domZippilli) or [@amackillop](https://github.com/amackillop)?\n\nI see in the PR it's configurable. I think as long as that's the case, developers who don't want the variation in behavior can set the minimum size to `0`.\n\neta: Also, I'm still not sure I like that it varies across channels, rather than a consistent behavior on a node.", "Perhaps wait for developers who do want/need the variation in behavior to show up and only then implement? I think the \"principle of least astonishment\" is worth considering.", "> Perhaps wait for developers who do want/need the variation in behavior to show up and only then implement? I think the \"principle of least astonishment\" is worth considering.\n\nWell, we likely do want to enable MUP in LDK Node, especially when persisting vs. remote storage/VSS. The question is whether it's preferable to *always* use MUP, even for very small monitors. I'd be reluctant to expose a setting in LDK Node for this, as I don't think our users would have better insight into which way to go than we do.", "> Perhaps wait for developers who do want/need the variation in behavior to show up and only then implement? I think the \"principle of least astonishment\" is worth considering.\n\nFWIW I think the \"principle of least astonishment\" is served perfectly fine by changing the MUP to persist full monitors when they're small - there's no material difference in user-visible behavior between persisting full monitors and small ones, except the performance changes (i.e. we definitely can't persist full monitors that are huge). When persisting small monitors, its no difference from hitting the cleanup ID where we delete the updates anyway. Because of this I still think this change is *strictly better* than the current version.", ">there's no material difference in user-visible behavior between persisting full monitors and small ones\n\nThat's clear. I was thinking of least astonishment in reasoning about and resolving potential problems. Basically what @domZippilli mentions in https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/3770#issuecomment-2984271612.\n\nIn this case, I would define 'strictly better' as a performance increase without an increase in complexity." ],

When the API key is empty, the header becomes `Authorization: Basic ` or `Authorization: Bearer `, which is considered an illegal header value by the HTTP library and causes the execution to fail ([source](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/blob/bb955806e042517831b232948c3f9f7150ac5fb6/api/core/workflow/nodes/http_request/executor.py)). The code only checks that the API key field exists, not that it contains a non-empty value.\n\nAs a workaround, avoid configuring HTTPRequest nodes with empty API keys for these auth types. If your workflow might have an empty key, consider adding logic to skip the HTTPRequest node or switch to \"no-auth\" when the key is empty. There’s currently no built-in validation or warning for this in Dify, so it’s a systemic issue, not a new regression.\n\nNo official documentation or existing issues address this yet. It would be helpful for the platform to add validation or user warnings for empty API keys in future releases.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

      "description" : "### Apache Airflow version\n\n3.0.2\n\n### If \"Other Airflow 2 version\" selected, which one?\n\n_No response_\n\n### What happened?\n\nI opened the Trigger Dag form in the Airflow 3 UI and filled in parameters under the section “Run Parameters” (or under “Advanced Options → Configuration JSON”). \n\nWhen I submit the form to backfill a historical date range, the DAG run is created and executes, but the parameters I entered are not actually passed into the tasks. Inside the task, references like {{ params.my_param }} or accessing context[\"params\"][\"my_param\"] remain unset. \n\nAlthough the UI shows the parameters form, these values never make it into the task context. \n\n### What you think should happen instead?\n\nWhen I trigger a backfill from the Airflow 3 UI and enter parameters in the Run Parameters or Advanced Options → Configuration JSON, these values should be passed to each DAG run created during the backfill.\n\nInside the DAG, I should be able to access them using:\n\t•\t{{ params.my_param }} in templates\n\t•\tcontext[\"params\"][\"my_param\"] in Python code\n\nThis is how it works when triggering a single DAG run from the UI, so the behavior should be the same for backfills. The parameters entered in the UI should override the defaults defined in the DAG and be available in all backfilled runs.\n\n### How to reproduce\n\n1.\tCreate the following DAG:\n\n```\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom airflow.decorators import dag, task\nfrom airflow.models.param import Param, ParamsDict\n\n@task\ndef test_backfill_with_params(params: ParamsDict):\n    assert params.get(\"id\") is not None\n\n@dag(\n    dag_id='test_backfill',\n    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),\n    schedule='@daily',\n    catchup=False,\n    default_args={'owner': 'Gery', 'retries': 0},\n    params={\n        \"id\": Param(default=None, title=\"My id\", description=\"My id\", type=[\"null\", \"string\"]),\n    }\n)\ndef test_backfill_dag():\n    test_backfill_with_params()\n\ntest_backfill_dag()\n```\n\n2.\tGo to the Airflow 3 UI.\n3.\tOpen the Backfill modal for the test_backfill DAG.\n4.\tSet a date range (e.g., start and end: 2025-06-01 00:00 and 2025-06-02 00:00).\n5.\tIn the Run Parameters section, set id = \"1234\".\n6.\tTrigger the backfill.\n\nExpected: The DAG run(s) should pass \"id\": \"1234\" to the task, and the assertion should pass.\nActual: The parameter is not passed, and the task fails due to params.get(\"id\") being None.\n\n### Operating System\n\nMac OS 14.6 (23G80)\n\n### Versions of Apache Airflow Providers\n\nNo providers\n\n### Deployment\n\nDocker-Compose\n\n### Deployment details\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Are you willing to submit PR?\n\n- [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n",

However, if you look at all this in General keep in mind that we also have also such scenarios on purpose:\n```\ncontext.requireOnline(purpose, false);\ntry {\n  doSomethingWithNetwork();\n} catch (IOException e) {\n  if (isOfflineMode()) {\n    return false;\n  }\n  throw e;\n}\n```\n\nThe idea of this pattern is that we do not have to do too many pointless online requests (flooding github.com) and prevent that if github.com would be done for whatever reason that this blocks all other network operations of IDEasy.", "While I was looking through the usages of `isOnline()`, I found this method inside `GitContextImpl.java`:\n\n\n```\n  private void handleErrors(Path targetRepository, ProcessResult result) {\n    if (!result.isSuccessful()) {\n      String message = \"Failed to update git repository at \" + targetRepository;\n      if (this.context.isOffline()) {\n        this.context.warning(message);\n        this.context.interaction(\"Continuing as we are in offline mode - results may be outdated!\");\n      } else {\n        this.context.error(message);\n        if (this.context.isOnline()) {\n          this.context.error(\"See above error for details.

Do you want to continue anyways?\");\n      }\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nI am a little bit confused about the functionality: in the `if` it says  `if (this.context.isOffline())` which means `if (!isOnline() || isOfflineMode())` but then in the interaction underneath, it says `\"Continuing as we are in offline mode - results may be outdated!\"` which does not have to be true - we could also be actually offline and not just in offline mode.\n\nThen inside the `else` we check `if (this.context.isOnline())` and then also do an `else` here. This `else` will never be used, as inside this Block `isOnline() && !isOfflineMode()` is true.\n\n@hohwille  Should this method be refactored?" ],
