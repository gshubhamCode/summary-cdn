If Seastar doesn't mess this up (e.g., by using a map instead of a list), this can be a way to specify two key components without needing to invent yet another serialization format.\r\n", "According to https://support.datastax.com/s/article/HOW-TO-Specify-composite-partition-keys-for-SSTable-utilities, the colon is expected to work - although this isn't officially specified in the nodetool getendpoints documentation so I'm note sure we should follow this bad advice:\r\n\r\nThe reason why this is a bad syntax is that it makes keys like \"a:b\" ambiguous - is it one component with the \":\" character, or two components? It's not an issue of implementation, it's a bug in nodetool syntax that makes this case ambiguous and nodetool has no idea what the user intended.\r\n\r\n> Since the key is passed over an http-based interface I suggest to allow encoding `:` characters using the standard http encoding as `%3A` substrings (`seastar::http::internal::url_decode` can be used to decode such strings).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if that was your intention, but such encoding (which obviously has to happen when building the REST API URL), will not help to differentiate whether \"a:b\" is two components or one with a colon. Also, if the nodetool API is already ambgious (what does the \"a:b\" the user passed mean?) there is no way that additional encoding can fix it.\r\n\r\nIf you change anything in this area, please don't forget to add tests.", "From the api standpoint what I had in mind is to pass `key=a%3Ab` if the non-composite key (or one of its components) contains `:`.\r\nThe user can pass that to nodetool as well.\r\n\r\nThat said, allowing passing multiple components as request parameters is possible too, though with the current interface it is not intuitive to assume that the multiple key parameters indicate multiple components of a composite key rather than multiple keys, if the API supported returning the natural endpoints for multiple keys.\r\n\r\nNote that `%3A` is supported for `keyspace:table` \"tuples\" when passed as a single parameter or as a comma-separated list of `keyspace:table`, to support keyspace or table names containing `:`.", "> From the api standpoint what I had in mind is to pass `key=a%3Ab` if the non-composite key (or one of its components) contains `:`. The user can pass that to nodetool as well.\r\n\r\n`key=a%3Ab` is the url-encoded form of setting key to `a:b`. But now that Scylla receives it, how does it know if this was intended to be a string key `a:b` or two components?\r\n\r\nMaybe you were thinking of encoding **twice**? If that's the case, the first layer of encoding doesn't need to be URL encoding. Just the outer layer of encoding must be.\r\n\r\nAre you sure about what you said about `keyspace:table` allowing real \":\"? Last time I checked, I found that at least in one context, you are only allowed to have colons in the table name, not keyspace name (e.g., in Alternator GSI), and what happens is simply that Scylla splits only on the first colon, so `xyz:abc:qwe` means that `xyz` is the keyspace, `abc:qwe` is the table. That's a different thing that what you are hoping to do here.", "Can't we use key:\"value:has:colons\"?

But we need to be consistent, and the proposal to use %3A to encode column characters is consistent with an http-based REST API.\r\n\r\nBut it won't be \"consistent\" - you'll need to run the URL encoding **twice**, which is possible, but not something traditionally done in HTTP. So we gain nothing by making the \"inner\" encoding also another invocation of the URL encoding, it can be something else like quotes or backslashing colons or something.

Test in test/rest_api that checks the REST API request in two cases: single-partition-key-column-and-colon-in-the-key and two-partition-key-column-and-colon-used-as-separator. Perhaps we already have a test for the latter case?\n2. Test in dtest or test/nodetool (I'm not up to date on what's right) that checks the nodetool command, not rest api. What we change in the REST API **should** translate also to the nodetool command but it's not obvious that it does and should be tested. Some ideas raised in this issue required even more explicit changes to nodetool that would need to be tested.\n\nPlease also see my recommendation in https://github.com/scylladb/scylladb/pull/24720 to improve the commit message to say exactly what we're fixing and what we aren't, and also consider which documentation we need to update to explain the situation with the colon.\n\n> \n> [@denesb](https://github.com/denesb) should review\n\n", "We should fix for non-singular keys too, otherwise we are just kicking the can down the road." ],

Specifically, inside `DagFileProcessor._execute_dag_callbacks`, the following code fails:\n`dag = dagbag.dags[request.dag_id]  # returns empty\n`\n\nThis happens because `dagbag.process_file()` cannot find the DAG file at the specified path (versions/<commit_hash>/...), and so the DAG is never loaded, and the callback is silently skipped.\n\n### What you think should happen instead\n\nThe DAG Processor should also materialize the correct version of the DAG source code (i.e., clone the Git repository to the appropriate `versions/<commit_hash>` path) before attempting to load and execute DAG-level callbacks.\n\n\n\n### How to reproduce\n\n1. Use GitDagBundle with supports_versioning=True.\n2. Define a DAG-level `on_failure_callback` or `on_success_callback`.\n3. Deploy a new Git version and trigger a DAG run that invokes the callback.\n4. The DAG tasks execute successfully.\n5. But DAG callback fails because the path in the callback request is under versions/<commit_hash>/, which is not materialized\n6. As a workaround, we patched GitDagBundle.refresh() to also clone the repo into the `versions/` directory.\n\n### Anything else\n\nIn our environment, DAGs are triggered via Asset, but this should not affect the behavior.\n\n### Are you willing to submit PR?\n\n- [x] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n",

For each human-readable string found:\r\n   - Create a unique, descriptive key for the string\r\n   - Replace the string with `i18n(key)`\r\n   - Add the key-value pair to `./src/gui/src/i18n/translations/en.js`\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```javascript\r\n<button>Submit</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```javascript\r\n<button>{i18n('submit')}</button>\r\n```\r\nIn `./src/gui/src/i18n/translations/en.js`:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst en = {\r\n    name: \"English\",\r\n    english_name: \"English\",\r\n    code: \"en\",\r\n    dictionary: {\r\n        // ... existing translations\r\n        'submit_button_text': 'Submit',\r\n        // ... existing translations\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Additional Notes\r\n\r\n- Ensure keys are descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention\r\n- Be cautious with dynamic text or text that includes variables\r\n- Consider context when creating keys to avoid potential conflicts\r\n\r\n## Definition of Done\r\n\r\n- All human-readable text in files under `./src/gui/src/UI` is replaced with `i18n(key)` calls.\r\n- All new keys are added to `./src/gui/src/i18n/translations/en.js` with correct English translations.\r\n- The application builds without errors and all UI elements display correctly.",

This is the preventing policy:\n\n```\n  statement {\n    actions = [\"ec2:CreateTags\"]\n\n    resources = [\n      \"arn:${local.partition}:ec2:*:*:volume/*\",\n      \"arn:${local.partition}:ec2:*:*:snapshot/*\",\n    ]\n\n    condition {\n      test     = \"StringEquals\"\n      variable = \"ec2:CreateAction\"\n      values = [\n        \"CreateVolume\",\n        \"CreateSnapshot\",\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nSo the condition only permits creating tags on CreateAction while DeleteTags does not implement any condition.\n\nIf your request is for a new feature, please use the `Feature request` template.\n\n- [X] ✋ I have searched the open/closed issues and my issue is not listed.\n\n## Versions\n\n- Module version [Required]:\n5.54.0\n- Terraform version:\n1.11.4\n- Provider version(s):\nv5.83.0\n\n## Reproduction Code [Required]\n\nkubectl apply -f manifests/pod-with-volume.yaml\nkubectl apply -f manifests/volumeattributesclass.yaml\n\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n\n1. Create a VAC for which a tag is specified which will be created on the EBS volume\n2. Set the volume attribute class on a PVC\n3. EBS CSI volume fails with error:\n\n`\"Error from AWS API\" err=\"api error UnauthorizedOperation: You are not authorized to perform this operation. User: ebs-csi-role is not authorized to perform: ec2:CreateTags on resource: <volume_arn> because no identity-based policy allows the ec2:CreateTags action.`\n\n`failed to create tags\" err=\"operation error EC2: CreateTags, https response error StatusCode: 403\n`\n## Expected behavior\n\nWhen the condition:\n\n```\n    condition {\n      test     = \"StringEquals\"\n      variable = \"ec2:CreateAction\"\n      values = [\n        \"CreateVolume\",\n        \"CreateSnapshot\",\n      ]\n    }\n```\n\nIs removed from the policy, EBS CSI controller is able to create a tag specified in VAC on an EBS volume.\n\n## Actual behavior\n\nEBS CSI fails to create tag due to AWS policy which permits creating tags only on a ec2:CreateAction\n",

But on the web (via `flutter run -d chrome` or dartpad) this method always returns -1.\nI also found two strange behaviors (potential bugs?).\n1. `frameNumber` has the old value until the end of the transientCallbacks phase. If this is not a bug, it should be documented. The picture below shows a different number in different callbacks during a frame. (underlined in blue)\n2.  `scheduleMicrotask` method calls its callback after the frame ends on the web, and not between `onBeginFrame` and `onDrawFrame` as expected (underlined in red). On the desktop (Windows) it works correctly.\n\n### Code sample\n\n<details open><summary>Code sample</summary>\n\n```dart\nimport 'dart:async';\nimport 'dart:ui';\n\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:flutter/scheduler.dart' show SchedulerBinding, Ticker;\n\nvoid main() {\n  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();\n\n  // ignore: invalid_use_of_protected_member\n  SchedulerBinding.instance.ensureFrameCallbacksRegistered();\n\n  final onBeginFrame = PlatformDispatcher.instance.onBeginFrame;\n  final onDrawFrame = PlatformDispatcher.instance.onDrawFrame;\n\n  PlatformDispatcher.instance.onBeginFrame = (Duration elapsed) {\n    print('+' * 30);\n    final frameNumber = PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber;\n    print('frameNumber from onBeginFrame callback: $frameNumber');\n    onBeginFrame!(elapsed);\n    print('___finish onBeginFrame');\n  };\n\n  PlatformDispatcher.instance.onDrawFrame = () {\n    print('___start onDrawFrame');\n    onDrawFrame!();\n    final frameNumber = PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber;\n    print('frameNumber from onDrawFrame callback: $frameNumber');\n    print('-' * 30);\n  };\n\n  runApp(const App());\n}\n\nclass App extends StatelessWidget {\n  const App({super.key});\n\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return const MaterialApp(debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false, home: Home());\n  }\n}\n\nclass Home extends StatefulWidget {\n  const Home({super.key});\n\n  @override\n  State<Home> createState() => _HomeState();\n}\n\nclass _HomeState extends State<Home> with TickerProviderStateMixin {\n  Ticker? ticker;\n\n  @override\n  void initState() {\n    super.initState();\n\n    SchedulerBinding.instance.addPersistentFrameCallback((_) {\n      final frameNumber = PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber;\n      print('frameNumber from the persistent callback: $frameNumber');\n    });\n\n    ticker = createTicker((_) {\n      final frameNumber = PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber;\n      print('frameNumber from the transient callback: $frameNumber');\n      scheduleMicrotask(() {\n        final frameNumber = PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber;\n        print('frameNumber from the microtask callback: $frameNumber');\n      });\n      SchedulerBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback((_) {\n        final frameNumber = PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber;\n        print('frameNumber from the postframe callback: $frameNumber');\n      });\n    })..start();\n\n    Timer(const Duration(seconds: 1), () {\n      ticker?.dispose();\n      ticker = null;\n    });\n  }\n\n  @override\n  void dispose() {\n    ticker?.dispose();\n    super.dispose();\n  }\n\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return const Placeholder();\n  }\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Screenshots or Video\n\n<details open>\n<summary>Screenshots / Video demonstration</summary>\n\nOn the desktop:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abca8f1d-4d88-4d5a-988e-974c58d0052e)\n\nOn the web:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fcfb6c2-ea1e-4c92-b62f-d7a800e01791)\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Logs\n\n\n\n\n### Flutter Doctor output\n\n<details open><summary>Doctor output</summary>\n\n```console\n[√] Flutter (Channel main, 3.33.0-1.0.pre.619, on Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.19045.5965], locale ru-RU)\n[√] Windows Version (Њ ©Єа®б®дв Windows 10 Pro 64-а §ап¤­ п, 22H2, 2009)\n[√] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 34.0.0)\n[√] Chrome - develop for the web\n[√] Visual Studio - develop Windows apps (Visual Studio Build Tools 2022 17.6.5)\n[√] Android Studio (version 2022.2)\n[√] VS Code (version 1.101.1)\n[√] Connected device (4 available)\n[√] Network resources\n\n• No issues found!\n```\n\n</details>\n",

The User Stories should follow this pattern:-->\r\nAs a app user I want know if at a poi my language is spoken so that I know if it is worth for me to go there.\r\n\r\n### Additional Context\r\n<!-- Add any other information or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\r\nSee: https://openproject.tuerantuer.org/projects/community-feedback/work_packages/3231/activity\r\n\r\n### Design Requirements\r\n<!-- If the customization includes input from our design team, the detailed requirements will be collected here. Note: These will exist mainly in German to simplify internal communication. -->\r\nNone.\r\n\r\nblocked by https://github.com/digitalfabrik/integreat-cms/issues/2799",

      "description" : "Part of #12048\n\n## Issue\nAfter most of the Unit Test migration in #12048, there are a lot of inconsistencies in access control test methods. This is because we did not migrate the many convenient, abstracted, and commonly used access control test methods from `ui/webapi/BaseActionTest.java` to `sqlui/webapi/BaseActionTest.java`.\n\nAfter merging #13254, all of the access control test methods in `BaseActionTest.java` have been migrated. Hence, this issue aims to refactor the unit test access controls to use these convenient test methods.\n\n## Progress\nThe progress for this refactoring can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IcB-viJMrIOknYoBYasBuRBK9qnwY0-doEK4_Eb24IA/edit?gid=0#gid=0). I (the author) will update it when completed PRs are merged proactively.\n\n## Steps to Contribute\n\n1. Choose test(s) to work on in the above Google Sheets link\n2. Check that no on else have claimed the test cases to work on within the last 2 weeks, or that it has been completed by follow up PRs (but not updated in the sheets)\n3. Comment on this issue to indicate that you'd like to contribute on the chosen test(s). Update your comment if you need more than 2 weeks so that other contributors don't overlap with your work.\n4. Create a PR to refactor the unit test(s).\n5. Submit the PR, with a link to this issue by starting the description with \"Part of #13304\"## Tips\n\n- Understand the access control test methods in `sqlui/webapi/BaseActionTest.java`, follow the refactoring in #13254\n- Most of the access control testing logic in the migrated unit tests under `sqlui/webapi` follows the old unit tests under `ui/webapi`, so you may wish to reference the old unit test for help",

      "repositoryName" : "elizaOS/eliza",
      "description" : "# Migrate remaining CLI input methods to use @clack/prompts for consistency\n\n## \uD83C\uDFAF Summary\n\nCurrently, the CLI uses a mix of input libraries (`inquirer`, Bun's global `prompt()`, and `@clack/prompts`). We should standardize on `@clack/prompts` for a consistent user experience and better styling across all CLI interactions.\n\n## \uD83D\uDCCB Current State\n\nMost of the CLI already uses `@clack/prompts` properly, but there are **2 main files** still using other input methods:\n\n### 1. `src/utils/plugin-creator.ts` - Using `inquirer` \uD83D\uDCE6\n\nThis file has multiple `inquirer.prompt()` calls that need to be migrated:\n\n- **Plugin specification collection** (~line 172-290):\n  - Plugin name input\n  - Plugin description input  \n  - Plugin features input\n  - Component selection (checkbox)\n  - Action names input\n  - Provider names input\n  - Evaluator names input\n  - Service names input\n\n### 2. `scripts/generate-unit-tests.ts` - Using global `prompt()` \uD83D\uDD27\n\n- **Test generation confirmation** (~line 165):\n  ```typescript\n  const answer = prompt('Generate tests? (y/n): ');\n  ```\n\n## ✨ Benefits of Migration\n\n1. **Consistent UX** - All CLI interactions will have the same look and feel\n2. **Better styling** - Clack provides superior visual design and animations\n3. **Better error handling** - Clack has built-in cancellation handling\n4. **Reduced dependencies** - Can remove `inquirer` from package.json\n5. **Type safety** - Better TypeScript integration\n\n## \uD83D\uDD27 Implementation Examples\n\n### For `plugin-creator.ts`:\n\n**Before (inquirer):**\n```typescript\nconst answers = await inquirer.prompt([\n  {\n    type: 'input',\n    name: 'name',\n    message: 'Plugin name (without \"plugin-\" prefix):',\n    validate: (input: string) => input.length > 0 || 'Plugin name is required'\n  }\n]);\n```\n\n**After (clack):**\n```typescript\nconst name = await clack.text({\n  message: 'Plugin name (without \"plugin-\" prefix):',\n  validate: (input) => input.length > 0 ? undefined : 'Plugin name is required'\n});\n\nif (clack.isCancel(name)) {\n  clack.cancel('Operation cancelled.');\n  process.exit(0);\n}\n```\n\n### For `generate-unit-tests.ts`:\n\n**Before:**\n```typescript\nconst answer = prompt('Generate tests? (y/n): ');\n```\n\n**After:**\n```typescript\nconst answer = await clack.confirm({\n  message: 'Generate tests?',\n  initialValue: true\n});\n\nif (clack.isCancel(answer)) {\n  console.log('Cancelled.');\n  return;\n}\n```\n\n## ✅ Reference Files (Already Using Clack)\n\nThese files are already properly implemented and serve as good examples:\n- `src/commands/create/actions/creators.ts`\n- `src/commands/create/index.ts`\n- `src/commands/env/actions/edit.ts`\n- `src/commands/publish/utils/validation.ts`\n- `src/utils/cli-prompts.ts`\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Replace all `inquirer.prompt()` calls in `plugin-creator.ts` with clack equivalents\n- [ ] Replace global `prompt()` call in `generate-unit-tests.ts` with clack\n- [ ] Remove `inquirer` dependency from `package.json` if no longer used elsewhere\n- [ ] Ensure all prompts handle cancellation properly (ctrl+c)\n- [ ] Test plugin creation flow works identically to current behavior\n- [ ] Test unit test generation script works identically to current behavior\n- [ ] Maintain existing validation logic and error messages\n- [ ] Update any related TypeScript types if needed\n\n## \uD83C\uDFAF Priority\n\n**Medium** - This improves developer experience and code consistency but doesn't affect core functionality.\n\n## \uD83D\uDCA1 Implementation Notes\n\n- The `generate-unit-tests.ts` part would be a good **beginner-friendly** task\n- The `plugin-creator.ts` part is more complex due to multiple sequential prompts\n- Consider breaking this into two separate PRs if needed\n- Make sure to test the checkbox selection for component types in plugin creation\n\n---\n\n**Note**: The majority of the CLI already uses clack properly - this is just cleaning up the last few stragglers to ensure complete consistency across the entire CLI experience.",

The core logic for assembling the answer changed in recent updates, specifically in the `_run` method of `answer_node.py`, which now processes and merges template/user text and LLM output differently. This likely causes the LLM output to appear outside your custom tags, leaving the tag empty instead of wrapping the LLM output as before [[source]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/blob/37e19de7ab3d8c1ffd8dfd8b789ff52b47f981cb/api/core/workflow/nodes/answer/answer_node.py).\n\nThere’s no documentation or open issue directly tracking this, but similar regressions have happened before when output formatting or merging logic was refactored. If you need a workaround, try adjusting your template or node configuration to see if you can force the LLM output inside the tag, or temporarily revert to 1.4.3 if that’s feasible for your deployment. If you’re using structured output, double-check your schema and model compatibility, as recent changes in structured output handling have also caused related issues for some users [[source]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/20975).\n\nIf you need to track this for a future fix, keep an eye on changes to `answer_node.py` and related workflow node logic in upcoming releases.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

It seems that changed part only add a wrapper \"ArrayFileSegment\" of return files. I doubt if this will change the answer of my custom tag.", "<!-- Answer -->\nYou're correct—adding the ArrayFileSegment wrapper only affects how file outputs are handled and does not impact string outputs or the formatting of your custom tags in the answer node. The regression with your custom tag is more likely due to changes in how the answer node parses and merges templates and variables. Specifically, the answer is now assembled by splitting your template into text and variable chunks, then merging them, which can cause issues if the chunk boundaries don't align with your tags (for example, if you have a template like `<tag>{{#llm#}}</tag>`) [[source]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/blob/37e19de7ab3d8c1ffd8dfd8b789ff52b47f981cb/api/core/workflow/nodes/answer/answer_stream_generate_router.py).\n\nIf your tags are ending up empty, it's likely because the variable replacement logic is splitting the template in a way that separates the tag from the variable. This is unrelated to ArrayFileSegment and is instead a subtle change in the template parsing or merging logic. You might be able to work around this by adjusting your template so that the variable is not directly inside the tag, or by experimenting with different placements of your tags and variables. If you need to dig deeper, reviewing the logic in AnswerStreamGeneratorRouter and the template parsers (PromptTemplateParser, VariableTemplateParser) will show exactly how the chunks are split and merged.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

The frontend now uses a custom Rehype plugin that strips or alters any HTML tag that doesn't match the regex /^[a-z][a-z0-9]*$/i, converting it to plain text. This means custom tags (like `<tag>`) are no longer rendered as HTML elements, which is why your LLM output appears outside the tag or the tag appears empty in the UI, even though the backend (and debug panel) output is correct. This stricter sanitation was likely added for security reasons and is not documented as a breaking change, so it may not have been present or as strict in 1.4.3 [reference](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/blob/37e19de7ab3d8c1ffd8dfd8b789ff52b47f981cb/web/app/components/base/markdown/index.tsx).\n\nTo work around this, you can use only standard HTML tags supported by the renderer, or adjust your template to avoid custom tags. If you need custom tag support, you would need to patch the frontend markdown renderer to relax or remove this restriction.

Check that no other contributor has already been assigned to this issue. If you believe that no one is actually working on it despite an assignment, ping the person. After one week without a response, the assignee may be changed.\n1. In the comments of this issue, request for it to be assigned to you, or just create a [pull request](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pulls) after following the steps below. [Mention](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) this issue in the description of the pull request.\n1. Fix the issue locally.\n1. [Run the test suite](https://llvm.org/docs/TestingGuide.html#unit-and-regression-tests) locally. Remember that the subdirectories under `test/` create fine-grained testing targets, so you can e.g. use `make check-clang-ast` to only run Clang's AST tests.\n1. Create a Git commit.\n1. Run [`git clang-format HEAD~1`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html#git-integration) to format your changes.\n1. Open a [pull request](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pulls) to the [upstream repository](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project) on GitHub. Detailed instructions can be found [in GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request). [Mention](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) this issue in the description of the pull request.\n\nIf you have any further questions about this issue, don't hesitate to ask via a comment in the thread below.\n\n", "\n@llvm/issue-subscribers-good-first-issue\n\nAuthor: Simon Pilgrim (RKSimon)\n\n<details>\nX86 uses ISD::isBuildVectorAllZeros to peek through bitcasts to match zero vectors in a large number of combines.\n\nIdeally we'd use SDPatternMatch to match these combines and use m_Zero() instead, but regrettably this fails to match the zero vectors through bitcasts,\n\nhttps://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/84397c61f44e62231d1876a745a0c1f74ea8a5b8 shows an example of the regression\n\nIf we convert m_Zero() to something closer to m_AllOnes / AllOnes_match we might be able to make this work.\n</details>\n", "Hi, I'd like to work on this issue.

Please keep this ticket updated with your progress so nobody thinks it has been abandoned.", "@average-avancha Any progress?", "Hi @RKSimon, sorry for the delay but I managed to put together a fix that should allow m_Zero to peek through bitcasts. I'm still testing the solution locally but I think it should work.\n\nHere's my fix on a fork of the repo: https://github.com/average-avancha/llvm-project/pull/1\n\nI can move forward with an actual PR once I'm done locally testing.\nI'd appreciate any feedback, thanks!", "@average-avancha The patch looks like it's just for IR PatternMatch, have you made any progress on the DAG SDPatternMatch equivalent?", "Not at the moment, seems like my effort was misguided.

This option is a type string.\r\nhttps://registry.terraform.io/providers/elastic/elasticstack/latest/docs/resources/fleet_integration\r\n\r\nQuestions are:  1) Could an value of \"latest\" or some other string be used in place of a specific numbered version to 'enable' terraform to Keep the integration(s) up to date?  2)  Could the Fleet API with 'keepPoliciesUpToDate' option be used to set/enable all integrations across the board to be kept update to date automatically?  3)  Is it advisable to try this or would there be any known or unintended consequences that might occur thereby making it something not to do or attempt?\r\n\r\nIt seems that since some of the integrations have the keep up to date feature and some do not, that there is a reason that not all integrations already have this Fleet UI toggle button.\r\n",

      "comments" : [ "+1 - we just ran into a problem related the fleet integrations when upgrading our entire stack from 8.15 -> 8.18\n\nI think because of the \"auto update\", the apm server integration got upgraded to 8.18 automatically, this broke our terraform state because it couldn't find the apm server integration 8.15.\n\nWe had to manipulate state to remove it, then found out that `terrafom import` is not supported for this resource type, so we had to manually go in kibana and delete the integration, so then terraform was able to proceed and create it.\n\nThis is really cumbersome\nIt's the first time we've ran into this because it's the first upgrade after we introduced terraform to manage our elastic stack.\n", "Plus, I'm wondering if it's even worth to have the integrations controlled by terraform, because when you bump the version, terraform tries to remove the integration and add a new one, but this fails because you cannot remove integrations that have a policy assigned to it.\n\nThis really breaks the whole point of automating this.\nAs a paying customer, I'm really disappointed that the terraform provider just seem like an afterthought, and there is really no other good alternative to maintain a bunch of elastic/kibana internal resources through IaC ", "It is a reasonable question to be asked, if it does make sense to manage the fleet integrations with Terraform. We do it for one of our setups since roughly 9 months and there are some challenges attached to it. The main reason we still do it is, that it helps us to keep everything under control between the 3 deployments (dev, test, prod).\n\nWhat we find challenging is to perform updates of the fleet integrations. We normally execute the update manually on dev and then \"backport\" the changes to Terraform by analyzing the differences in the execution plan. The main challenge there is rooted in the fact, that some of the properties (for example `vars`, if I recall correctly) are marked as sensitive in Terraform and therefore Terraform refuses to show the differences even if the property might not contain any sensitive value for some of the fleet integrations (where others actually do store sensitive values in this property). Since analyzing the differences in the JSON output of the Terraform plan became very painful (especially, since the values are JSON in JSON), we even built our own tool to assist with this (https://github.com/breml/tfreveal).\n\nThe bottom line is, that with the use of fleet integrations one faces the challange, that there are two different systems (Terraform and the install/update mechanism of Fleet), which change the state and therefore there is always drift, that one needs to handle in Terraform. Sofar we made it work, but compared with other systems, that we manage with Terraform, this is for sure one of the more painful ones." ],

The trade-off being higher confidence we have no flakes.\n\nI  think we can keep local test runs (by default) to continue to run with `-count=1` (the default) ie. `make unit-test`. And so no changes for local dev.\n\nBut given the frequency of flakey test runs, I do think it is worth it to run CI with `-count=2`. It will slow CI down, but flakey/buggy tests will likely fail checks. And if we have access to bigger build workers(?), I think that would help reduce the time (bigger workers = more CPUs = more tests running in parallel).\n\n(ill put this comment on https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/31013#pullrequestreview-2975837738 as well)\n\nThe final option would be to only run with a higher count upon merging to main.

During the first stage of training, the strong information bottleneck created by the VQ-VAE codebook forces the learned latent actions to capture only the information not inferable from task instructions—resulting in task-irrelevant latent actions.\n\nIn the second stage, with these task-irrelevant latents frozen, the newly initialized latent actions are trained to replace the role of language, allowing them to learn task-centric dynamics.\n\nThis also explains why, in naive latent action learning approaches like LAPA and Genie, latent action tokens mostly encode motion/dynamics—since texture information is already preserved from previous frames for future frame prediction in the decoder. ", "If your goal is to learn task-relevant tokens, why not directly use contrastive learning to encode those tokens and perform a soft alignment with the text instruction features?

      "repositoryName" : "VoltAgent/voltagent",
      "description" : "**1. Overview:**\n\nEnsure robust and up-to-date integration of the OpenAI API as a core LLM provider within the `voltagent` framework, utilizing the official `openai` Node.js SDK. This involves verifying support for the latest OpenAI models (GPT-4, GPT-3.5 variants), features (like tool calling, JSON mode), and ensuring the implementation aligns perfectly with the `LLMProvider` interface and `voltagent` conventions.\n\n**2. Goals:**\n\n*   Implement or verify a dedicated `OpenAIProvider` class adhering to the `LLMProvider` interface.\n*   Support core generation functionalities (`generateText`, `streamText`, `generateObject`, `streamObject`) using OpenAI models.\n*   Utilize the latest official `openai` Node.js SDK.\n*   Correctly map `voltagent` generation options (model, temperature, max tokens, tool choice, etc.) to OpenAI API parameters.\n*   Implement robust support for OpenAI's tool calling mechanism, mapping seamlessly to `voltagent`'s tool definition and execution flow.\n*   Support OpenAI's JSON mode for reliable structured output generation (`generateObject`/`streamObject`).\n*   Handle authentication using OpenAI API keys.\n*   Integrate OpenAI-specific error handling and response parsing.\n\n**3. Proposed Architecture & Components:**\n\n*   **`OpenAIProvider`:** A class (potentially existing but needing review/update) within `agent/providers` implementing `LLMProvider`. It should:\n    *   Use the official `openai` Node.js library.\n    *   Handle API client initialization (API key, potentially base URL for proxies).\n    *   Implement `generateText`, `streamText`, `generateObject`, `streamObject`, correctly formatting requests (messages, tools, model parameters) and parsing responses/streams.\n    *   Specifically handle the `tool_calls` and `tool_results` message flow for tool usage.\n*   **Provider Registration:** Ensure `OpenAIProvider` is correctly registered and selectable.\n*   **Configuration:** Allow users to select 'openai' as the provider, specify models (e.g., 'gpt-4-turbo', 'gpt-3.5-turbo'), and provide API keys.\n*   **Tool Mapping:** Refine the logic that translates `voltagent` tool definitions into the format expected by the OpenAI API's `tools` parameter and processes `tool_calls` responses.\n\n**4. Affected Core Modules:**\n\n*   `agent/providers`: `OpenAIProvider` class implementation/refinement.\n*   `agent/types`: Ensure types accurately reflect OpenAI's request/response structures, especially for tools.\n*   `ToolManager`: Interaction with `OpenAIProvider` for formatting tool definitions and handling tool calls.\n*   `Agent`/`Agent Options`: Configuration for provider selection, models, and credentials.\n*   Requires the `openai` dependency.\n\n**5. Acceptance Criteria (Initial MVP / Refinement):**\n\n*   Users can configure an `Agent` to use `OpenAIProvider` with various GPT models (e.g., GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-3.5 Turbo) and an API key.\n*   `agent.generateText()` and `agent.streamText()` work correctly.\n*   `agent.generateObject()` and `agent.streamObject()` utilize OpenAI's JSON mode successfully.\n*   Agents can reliably use tools defined in `voltagent`, with requests and responses correctly handled via the OpenAI tool calling API.\n*   Relevant options (temperature, max tokens, tool choice) are passed correctly.\n*   Integration uses the current version of the official `openai` SDK.\n*   Documentation reflects the updated/verified OpenAI integration details.\n\n**6. Potential Challenges & Considerations:**\n\n*   Keeping up with frequent updates and changes in the OpenAI API and SDK.\n*   Ensuring the tool calling implementation is robust and handles various edge cases (multiple tool calls, errors).\n*   Mapping `voltagent`'s internal state/history accurately to the sequence of messages expected by OpenAI, especially when including tool results.\n*   Handling differences in behavior or features across different OpenAI models.\n*   Cost management and monitoring token usage for OpenAI API calls.",

      "description" : "Add \"Rename\" Button for Preset Management with Popup Modal\r\n\r\n**Description:**\r\nWe need to add a \"Rename\" button between the ComboBox (for selecting presets) and the \"Delete\" button. When clicked, this button should open a popup modal asking the user to enter a new name for the selected preset. Upon confirming, the preset's name should be updated in the object (`presets.name`) and the associated file. The previous file with the old name should be deleted.\r\n\r\n**Tasks:**\r\n\r\n1. **Add the \"Rename\" button:**\r\n   - Place the \"Rename\" button between the ComboBox (preset selector) and the \"Delete\" button.\r\n   - Ensure the button is clearly labeled and fits within the existing layout.\r\n\r\n2. **Implement the popup modal:**\r\n   - Create a modal that appears when the \"Rename\" button is clicked.\r\n   - The modal should include:\r\n     - An input field for the new preset name.\r\n     - \"Confirm\" and \"Cancel\" buttons.\r\n   - The \"Confirm\" button should only be enabled if the input field is not empty.\r\n\r\n3. **Handle renaming logic:**\r\n   - Update the `presets.name` property with the new name when the user clicks \"Confirm\".\r\n   - Rename the corresponding preset file to match the new name and delete the old file.\r\n   - Ensure the file renaming is done safely, checking for any name conflicts or invalid characters.\r\n\r\n4. **Update the ComboBox selection and display:**\r\n   - Refresh the ComboBox options to reflect the updated preset name.\r\n   - Maintain the current selection in the ComboBox with the new name after renaming.\r\n\r\n5. **Test the renaming functionality:**\r\n   - Verify that the \"Rename\" button opens the modal correctly.\r\n   - Test renaming with various inputs (valid, invalid, empty, conflicting names).\r\n   - Confirm that the file is renamed correctly and the old file is deleted.\r\n   - Ensure the ComboBox updates to reflect the new name without issues.\r\n\r\n6. **Update documentation:**\r\n   - Document the new \"Rename\" functionality.\r\n   - Update any relevant sections of the user guide to explain how to rename presets.\r\n\r\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\r\n- The \"Rename\" button appears between the ComboBox and \"Delete\" button and functions as intended.\r\n- The popup modal asks the user for a new name, and the \"Confirm\" button only works when a valid name is provided.\r\n- The preset's name is updated both in the object (`presets.name`) and the corresponding file.\r\n- The previous file is deleted after renaming.\r\n- The ComboBox correctly displays the updated preset name.\r\n- Documentation is updated to reflect the new feature.\r\n\r\n**Additional Context:**\r\n- The project uses ImGui, and the modal should integrate seamlessly with the existing UI.\r\n- Ensure that renaming presets does not interfere with other functionalities like saving, loading, or deleting presets.",

Additionally, OpenAI seems to strangely bounce you back-and-forth between two equally obscure error messages if you cut-and-paste the error & ask for assistance.\n\nHey Jeremy, sure, as an example, in pyproject.toml the `tool.poetry.source` section must be an array, like `[[tool.poetry.source]]` even if you only specify one source. This makes total sense as arrays with 1 entry are completely valid.  \n\nThe confusion is that poetry will give you the error in my original message, which tells you something should be an array but not _which_ something, so the solution currently is just to review your pyproject.toml file very carefully with respect to what each tool you have using it expects.", "We already replace `data.` with `tool.poetry.` in https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry-core/blob/002aa3e16f98d21645bb9a45f698b55adc40f317/src/poetry/core/factory.py#L606-L609.\n\nWe probably have to do the same in https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/blob/aeaa3d09ce7381bf34ac7e0ac27b929841256c90/src/poetry/factory.py#L335." ],

The actions-user bot will reset the file back to previous state for the next contributor after your commit is merged. So you can just simply start working with the issue right away!*\r\n\r\n## How to get started\r\nOpen the `tasks/yaml/medium` directory from the root of your project.\r\nThen open up the `docker-compose.yml` file and once it is properly created according to the YAML syntax and the task in hand, you are done and ready to make a pull request!\r\n*Note: You can test your YAML code in a editor like [this](http://www.yamllint.com/)*.\r\n\r\n## Description:\r\n\r\nYour task is to create a `docker-compose.yml` file that describes a multi-service application. This application should contain:\r\n\r\n-   A web server running on port 8080 using the nginx image.\r\n-   A database server running on the default port using the postgres image.\r\n\r\nThe web server should have access to the database server but not vice versa.\r\n\r\n## Requirements:\r\n\r\n-   Use Docker Compose version 3.\r\n-   Specify service names, image versions, and exposed ports.\r\n-   Set up a custom network and make sure only the web server can communicate with the database.\r\n-   Use environment variables to set the database name, user, and password for the PostgreSQL service.\r\n\r\n## Example Structure:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nversion: '3'\r\n\r\nservices:\r\n  # Define your services here\r\n  \r\nnetworks:\r\n  # Define your networks here\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Evaluation Criteria:\r\n\r\n-   Valid YAML syntax.\r\n-   Correct use of Docker Compose version and features.\r\n-   Correct network setup.\r\n-   The web server should be able to connect to the database, but the database should not have access to the web server.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions and how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

It is clear that many contributors are not reading the contributing.MD or the documentation update readme. \n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nWe are a welcoming community and we would like to include all regardless of their learning methodology. Some read, others watch. So, we would like a video to welcome contributors and walk them through the basics of contributing to KubeStellar. Once completed, we can create a shortcut url and give it to anyone with a question about making a contribution. This saves everyone time.\n\n### Are you willing to contribute?\n\n- [ ] Yes, I'd like to help implement this feature.\n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_",

The actions-user bot will reset the file back to previous state for the next contributor after your commit is merged. So you can just simply start working with the issue right away!*\r\n\r\n## How to get started\r\n\r\nFor this task you need to have Python and NumPy installed. Check out [Installing Python](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge#installing-python) section in README if you need to install Python. If you already have Python installed, you can install NumPy using pip (Python's package installer) with the following terminal command:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npip install numpy\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr, if you're using Python 3 specifically and have both Python 2 and Python 3 installed, you may need to use:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npip3 install numpy\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter that you can open the `tasks/python/hard` directory from the root of the project. \r\nThen open `decision_tree.py` file and start working on your solution!\r\n\r\n![python-hard](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/assets/82566656/3fc4a704-a734-4b90-90fc-476ab367b7a1)\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nImplement a Decision Tree Classifier from scratch using Python. Do not use libraries like scikit-learn that have pre-implemented classifiers; instead, use basic libraries like NumPy for numerical calculations.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\n\r\n-   Understand the theory behind Decision Trees.\r\n-   Implement a simple yet functional Decision Tree Classifier.\r\n-   Test the classifier on a dataset.\r\n\r\nUse any freely available classification dataset. Ensure the dataset has at least 3 features and at least 2 classes.\r\n\r\nImplementation Steps:\r\n-   Write functions to calculate Gini impurity or Information Gain.\r\n-   Implement a class DecisionTree with methods for fitting and predicting.\r\n-   Implement a function to print/visualize the tree.\r\n\r\nTesting:\r\n-   Split the dataset into training and test sets and evaluate your classifier.\r\n\r\nAcceptance Criteria:\r\n\r\n-   Successfully implement a Decision Tree Classifier from scratch.\r\n-   Evaluate the classifier on a dataset, showing reasonable performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).\r\n\r\nResources:\r\n\r\n-   [Decision Trees - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning)\r\n\r\n## How to run\r\n\r\nMake sure you are in the right directory:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncd tasks/python/hard\r\n```\r\n\r\nExecute the following command to run your Python script:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npython decision_tree.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected output\r\n\r\nOutput should look similar to this:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nThe predicted class for the sample [0.4, 0.6] is 0.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the output looks correct, you are ready to make a pull request!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo work with this issue, you need to have Python installed to your local machine.\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions of installing Python and how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

      "comments" : [ "<!-- Answer -->\nThis issue is caused by a disconnect between the context available to Jinja templates during regular chart rendering and what is provided during drill-to-detail actions. When you drill, the frontend sends a new request that often lacks the full dashboard/global context (like dashboard filters or URL params) that your Jinja SQL expects, so the template renders incorrectly or with missing values. This is a known limitation and has been discussed in several issues and code reviews ([example](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/33591), [example](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/33579)).\n\nA workaround is to make your Jinja SQL more robust by using `if/else` blocks to provide default values when filters are missing, so the query always returns results and columns don't disappear. For example:\n\n```sql\nWITH calculation as (\n  SELECT count(*), country\n  FROM \"Vehicle Sales\"\n  WHERE 1=1\n  {% if filter_values('product_line') %}\n    and product_line in {{ filter_values('product_line')|where_in }}\n  {% else %}\n    and product_line = 'Classic Cars'\n  {% endif %}\n  GROUP BY country\n)\nSELECT * FROM calculation\n```\n([source](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/33591))\n\nIf your dataset relies on dashboard-level filters or variables, you may need to adjust your Jinja logic to handle cases where those are missing during drill actions.\n\nThere have also been recent changes to how Superset syncs dataset columns and processes Jinja templates, which can impact this behavior ([PR 30903](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/30903)). Make sure your configuration enables `ENABLE_TEMPLATE_PROCESSING` and that your feature flags are up to date.\n\nAt this time, there is no full workaround for preserving all dashboard context in drill-to-detail requests, but making your Jinja SQL more defensive can help avoid empty or broken results.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

      "description" : "### Describe the Bug\n\nThe Backup YAML example in [our doc website](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.9.0/snapshots-and-backups/backup-and-restore/create-a-backup) does not work. Because Longhorn mutator webhook requires providing [the correct `metadata.labels`](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn-manager/blob/16f796214eb359cdb9f9efbe577a2de68144081b/webhook/resources/backup/mutator.go#L63-L67) while the doc does not mention that.\n\nThere are 2 solutions for this:\n- Simply updating the doc by adding `metadata.labels` for the example YAMLs\n- The mutator should figure out and set up the labels automatically based on the input `spec.snapshotName`\n\nNow I may prefer the latter one since this solution can both\n- provide a better user experience\n- and forcibly ask the mutator to check the volume and snapshot existence before backup creation\n\n### To Reproduce\n\n1. Create and attach a volume\n2. Create a random snapshot\n3. Apply the following backup YAML provided by the doc:\n```\napiVersion: longhorn.io/v1beta2\nkind: Backup\nmetadata:\n  name: backup-example\n  namespace: longhorn-system\nspec:\n  backupMode: full\n  snapshotName: <volume snapshot name>\n  labels:\n    app: test\n```\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe backup should be created correctly\n\n### Support Bundle for Troubleshooting\n\n```\nubuntu:~$ kubectl apply -f backup.yaml\nError from server (InternalError): error when creating \"backup.yaml\": Internal error occurred: failed calling webhook \"mutator.longhorn.io\": failed to call webhook: post \"https://longhorn-admission-webhock.longhorn-system.svc:9502/v1/webhook/mutation?timeout=10s\": EOF\n```\n\n### Environment\n\n- Longhorn version: master-head (07/02/2025)\n\n### Additional context\n\nThis issue was found by community contributor @nzhan126  when she tried to test a backup-related fix. \n\n### Workaround and Mitigation\n\nSet up `matadata.labels` for the backup YAML. For example:\n```\napiVersion: longhorn.io/v1beta2\nkind: Backup\nmetadata:\n  name: backup-example\n  namespace: longhorn-system\n  labels:\n    backup-volume: <volume name>\nspec:\n  backupMode: full\n  snapshotName: <volume snapshot name>\n  labels:\n    app: test\n```\n",

With CREATE ALIAS support, you let malicious users get full access to the Hertzbeat server and run shell commands.\n\nCan we add a page that tells users that H2 support in Hertzbeat is meant for testing in sandboxed environment and it isn't meant for production?\n\n### Is your feature request related to a problem?

These manual steps create friction for new users and go against Docker's principle of providing a complete, automated setup experience.\n\n## Current Manual Steps\n\nAfter running `docker-compose up --build -d`, users must manually execute:\n\n```bash\ndocker exec -it samarium_app npm run dev\ndocker exec -it samarium_app composer dump-autoload\ndocker exec -it samarium_app php artisan migrate\ndocker exec -it samarium_app php artisan key:generate\ndocker exec -it samarium_app php artisan storage:link\ndocker exec -it samarium_app php artisan db:seed\n```\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nThe Docker setup should be fully automated - users should only need to run:\n1. `cp .env.docker.example .env`\n2. `docker-compose up --build -d`\n\nAfter these commands, the application should be ready to use without any additional manual intervention.\n\n",

      "description" : "<!-- (At least include the following, feel free to add if you have more content) -->\n\n## Feature request\n\nStarRocks support several functions to inspect the metadata of segment files:\n```sql\nselect count(id) from t1 [_META_];\nselect min(id) from t1 [_META_];\nselect max(id) from t1 [_META_];\nselect flat_json_meta(payload) from t1 [_META_];\n```\n\nEssentially it generates a `META_SCAN` operator to scan the metadata of underlying segment files, then aggregate the result with `count/min/max` functions.\n\nWe can leverage this mechanism to inspect the column size of a table, for example:\n\n```sql\nselect column_size(id) from t1 [_META_];\n```\n\nThere are several types of column sizes:  \n- **Uncompressed Size**: Stored in the `ColumnMetaPB` located in the segment footer.  \n- **Compressed Size**: Represents the on-disk size. While it is not explicitly stored in the footer, it can be estimated by analyzing the number of pages via the `OrdinalIndex` and calculating the average page size.  \n\nIt might be worthwhile to include a few functions for inspecting a column's metadata.\n\nFurther more, we can also consider add these column stats into the optimizer statistics system, stored in the `_statistics_.column_statistics` table.\n\n",

As of now, Souvlaki leaves it up to the user to change the URL depending on the platform.\r\n\r\nFor Linux, we follow the MPRIS specification, which actually doesn't say much cover art apart from what's in [here](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/mpris-spec/metadata/#mpris:arturl). It only says that local files should start with `file://` and that it should be an UTF-8 string, which is enforced by Rust. Maybe you can look in the source code of desktop managers such as GNOME or KDE, since these read the field to display it on their media player controls.\r\n\r\nFor Windows, we use the _SystemMediaTransportControlsDisplayUpdater_, which has [a thumbnail property](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.media.systemmediatransportcontrolsdisplayupdater.thumbnail?view=winrt-22621#windows-media-systemmediatransportcontrolsdisplayupdater-thumbnail). It accepts multiple formats, but we choose to create it using an URI. If setting an URL starting with `file://`, the file is automatically loaded by souvlaki.\r\n\r\nFor MacOS, you can look into [these lines](https://github.com/Sinono3/souvlaki/blob/384539fe83e8bf5c966192ba28e9405e3253619b/src/platform/macos/mod.rs#L131-L137) of the implementation. These lines refer to creating an [MPMediaItemArtwork](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mediaplayer/mpmediaitemartwork) object.\r\n\r\nI hope this is of use to you. If you find a good way to put this information in the docs, consider opening a pull request \uD83D\uDE42", "Documented in 5b89e4bae455e5aed07e2f57f9d8a5b92e62ecf5", "As a FYI and because not much is documented in the respective platforms and at least verified on Linux-MPRIS-dbus-KDE, the format of `data:MIMETYPE;base64,BASE64DATA` seems to work without problems.\nAnd i have not yet seen complaints of it not working in windows, mac or other linux environments.\nBy the way, [mpv-mpris](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/mpv-mpris/) seems to also use this format on linux.\n\n[termusic souvlaki cover_art setting](https://github.com/tramhao/termusic/blob/4fa58b87f15f5d87f705de2b38998563d28ba480/playback/src/mpris.rs#L73-L91).\n[MDN data: URLs - URIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Reference/Schemes/data)", "> As a FYI and because not much is documented in the respective platforms and at least verified on Linux-MPRIS-dbus-KDE, the format of `data:MIMETYPE;base64,BASE64DATA` seems to work without problems.

That's pretty neat, I've noticed even Google Chrome writes to a temporary file and uses a a `file://` url when using MPRIS.", "Wow @hasezoey, that's actually great news.

Update the task servers to remove the manual activation and deactivation. We do need to take some care that the instantiation of the interfaces then are ordered since some subscription callbacks might depend on some publishers activation or existence. So we should be creating all exporters (i.e. action clients, service clients, publishers) before  consumers (i.e. actions, services, subscribers) -- and deactivating all consumers before exporters (inverted). \n\nOn top, in the nav2 lifecycle node, we should autoactivate if the node is already activated when an interface is created (see `nav2::Publisher` for example)\n\n",

Yes we should definitly leave the get_uri method as it is (not get_url as it doesn’t exist yet) and implement a new get_url method which would then be called by the existing get_sqlalchemy_engine.\r\n\r\nYes, adding new method is the way to go. How to do it, should be proposed and discussed in the PR, we have 20+ sql providers, and I think the proposal should be complete and explain how to deal with cases that can/cannot be mapped. Also the method should explicily - IMHO - call our sqlalachemy, (`getSqlAlchemyURI` ?) and likely allow variations - from what I understand SQLAlchemy can have different URLs not only for different databases, but also for different drivers. Also some of our Connections allows to add different kinds of extras and parameters - not only hosts but other parameters that might be used and passed differently to different drivers.\r\n\r\nIf we decide to introduce a new \"standard\" method, in a product like Airflow and common API like DBApiHook, the proposal should provide answers to all the questions that users might ask in order to be mergable. It does not have to handle all of those but at least get enough error handlling and interface specification to explain what is the transition from the Connection form (in all those cases we have DBAPI implementation) -> SQLAlchemy URL.  Which variations are handled, how it should work, how to map engine args etc. \r\n\r\nI don't think it can be handled by a single implementation, it's more a scaffloiding + implementation for all the implementations and it should be designed nicely with al least a handful (if not all) implementation from the above list to be quite sure that we will be able to handle those cases. \r\n", "\r\n> Hey Andrey think there is some confusion here.

For example, instead of `/nix/store/<long string>/bin/.firefox-wrapped --name firefox`, I could configure it to just show `bin/firefox-wrapped --name firefox`.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nUsing a different distro would solve this but I don't wanna.\n\n**Additional context**\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c08d3137-e71b-492c-b81c-1c86827c9803)",

We need to add more to cover all the code in vllm-ascend, and there are several principles to follow:\n\n1. The overall file tree should be consistent with `vllm_ascend`\n2. The file name should be the original file name with a prefix `test_`\n3. Use `unittest` framework, make good use of mock\n4. The UTs are all running on cpu node, mock the function related to device to host\n\nPlease refer to the official doc on [contributing](https://vllm-ascend.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide/contribution/index.html) and [testing](https://vllm-ascend.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide/contribution/testing.html) to develop, thanks!\n### Unit tests need to add\n\n- [ ] |-- test__version.py\n- [x] |-- test_ascend_config.py\n- [ ] |-- test_attention\n- [ ] |   |-- test_attention.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_attention_v1.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_mla_v1.py\n- [ ] |-- compilation\n- [ ] |   `-- test_piecewise_backend.py\n- [ ] |-- core\n- [ ] |   |-- test_schedule_config.py @nuclearwu\n- [ ] |   `-- test_scheduler.py\n- [ ] |-- device_allocator\n- [ ] |   `-- test_camem.py\n- [ ] |-- distributed\n- [ ] |   |-- test_communicator.py @FieeFlip\n- [ ] |   |-- test_device_communicators @Agonixiaoxiao #1601\n- [ ] |   |   |-- test_pyhccl.py\n- [ ] |   |   `-- test_pyhccl_wrapper.py\n- [x] |   |-- kv_transfer @Agonixiaoxiao \n- [x] |   |   |-- test_simple_buffer.py https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1531\n- [x] |   |   |-- test_simple_connector.py https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1531\n- [x] |   |   |-- test_simple_pipe.py https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1531\n- [ ] |   |   `-- test_utils.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_llmdatadist_connector.py\n- [x] |   `-- test_parallel_state.py   @wangyanhui-cmss https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1460\n- [ ] |-- test_envs.py\n- [ ] |-- lora\n- [ ] |   `-- punica_wrapper @hongfugui\n- [ ] |       `-- test_punica_npu.py @hongfugui\n- [ ] |-- models\n- [ ] |   |-- test_deepseek_dbo.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_deepseek_mtp.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_deepseek_v2.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_qwen2_5_vl.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_qwen2_5_vl_without_padding.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_qwen2_vl.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_qwen3_moe.py\n- [ ] |-- multistream\n- [ ] |   |-- test_base.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_context.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_decorator.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_layers.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_metadata.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_ms_split.py\n- [ ] |-- ops\n- [ ] |   |-- test_activation.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_attention.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_cache.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_common_fused_moe.py\n- [x] |   |-- test_expert_load_balancer.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_fused_moe.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_layernorm.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_rotary_embedding.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_vocab_parallel_embedding.py\n- [ ] |-- patch\n- [ ] |   |-- platform\n- [ ] |   |   |-- patch_0_9_1\n- [ ] |   |   |-- patch_common\n- [ ] |   |   |   `-- test_test_patch_distributed.py\n- [ ] |   |   `-- patch_main\n- [ ] |   `-- worker\n- [ ] |       |-- patch_0_9_1\n- [ ] |       |-- patch_common\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_distributed.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_eagle.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_minicpm.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_multi_step_worker.py\n- [x] |       |   |-- test_patch_sampler.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_spec_decode_worker.py\n- [ ] |       |   `-- test_patch_utils.py\n- [ ] |       `-- patch_main\n- [x] |-- test_platform.py @zhanghw0354 https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1476\n- [ ] |-- quantization\n- [ ] |   |-- test_func_wrapper.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_quant_config.py @nuclearwu\n- [ ] |   |-- test_quantizer.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_w8a8.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_w8a8_dynamic.py\n- [ ] |-- sample\n- [ ] |   |-- ops\n- [ ] |   `-- test_rejection_sampler.py\n- [x] |-- test_utils.py\n- [ ] `-- worker \n- [ ] |-- test_cache_engine.py @machenglong2025\n- [ ] |-- test_draft_model_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_model_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_model_runner_v1.py\n- [ ]  |-- test_mtp_proposer_v1.py @machenglong2025\n- [ ] |-- test_multi_step_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_multi_step_worker.py\n- [ ] |-- test_pooling_model_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_worker.py @zhanghw0354\n- [ ] `-- test_worker_v1.py @zhanghw0354\n",

      "comments" : [ "Sorry, I haven't tried IPv6 in Docker. This weekend I tried to set up a local IPv6 network by using VirtualBox, but not successful.\r\n\r\nI checked our servers and found the IPv6 address of `docker0` is like `fe80::aaaa:bbbb:cccc:dddd`, not `fe80::1` you showed. I'm not sure if this is an issue?\r\n\r\nFrom the document [IPv6 with Docker | Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/v17.09/engine/userguide/networking/default_network/ipv6/) we can see that the IPv6 address of `docker0` is like `2001:db8::c008/125`.\r\n\r\nSo sorry, I cannot help you now. But I would like to try IPv6 when I have time.\r\n\r\nIf you have any updates please let me know, thanks!", "@chaifeng thank you for your timely response. I took a look at the documentation you mentioned and made the changes that they describe. It now looks like the docker0 interface has two versions of an IPv6 address. I will admit i'm pretty new to firewalls and very new to ufw so i'm not even sure what the best way to debug this would be. I don't really need IPV6 container support and I think it would be better to have the IPV6 requests to my server to be forwarded as IPV4, but i'm not sure how to do that. \r\n\r\nThe reason I found this issue was because I was unable to access my website from my phone when not connected to WIFI. My LTE connection has an IPV6 address which makes my site unreachable.\r\n\r\nifconfig: \r\n```\r\ndocker0: flags=4099<UP,BROADCAST,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500\r\n        inet 172.17.0.1  netmask 255.255.0.0  broadcast 172.17.255.255\r\n        inet6 fe80::1  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>\r\n        inet6 2001:db8:1::1  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x0<global>\r\n        ether 02:42:0e:75:6d:9a  txqueuelen 0  (Ethernet)\r\n        RX packets 0  bytes 0 (0.0 B)\r\n        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0\r\n        TX packets 0  bytes 0 (0.0 B)\r\n        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have updated my after6.rules to reflect the new address:\r\n```\r\n# BEGIN UFW AND DOCKER\r\n*filter\r\n:ufw6-user-forward - [0:0]\r\n:DOCKER-USER - [0:0]\r\n-A DOCKER-USER -j RETURN -s 2001:db8:1::/64\r\n-A DOCKER-USER -p udp -m udp --sport 53 --dport 1024:65535 -j RETURN\r\n\r\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw6-user-forward\r\n\r\n-A DOCKER-USER -j DROP -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,ACK SYN -d 2001:db8:1::/64\r\n-A DOCKER-USER -j DROP -p udp -m udp --dport 0:32767 -d 2001:db8:1::/64\r\n\r\n-A DOCKER-USER -j RETURN\r\nCOMMIT\r\n# END UFW AND DOCKER\r\n```\r\n\r\nI enabled ufw logging and I can still see the request being blocked.

", "@ShapeShifter499 I think the goal of `ufw-docker` is to block network access to docker containers running on the host from whatever network is attached to the host. Exactly like the goal of `ufw` is to block network access to processes running on the host from whatever network is attached to the host.\nThe network attached to the host can be public (typical of a public server rented from a provider) or private (typical of a home or company network).\nEven if your network is private, for whatever reason you might want to block access to a container (or to a specific port of that container) from that network and only allow access to it from the docker host.\nThe above is true regardless of whether your docker host has IPv4 or IPv6 (or both) on its network interface(s). You'll have to deal with separate and independent block rules for IPv4 and IPv6.\n\nIf your docker host is on a private network behind a router/firewall and you are happy for whatever container to be accessible from that private network, you may disregard `ufw-docker` completely and only use your router/firewall to control access from the public internet (or other private networks).\nThe above is also true regardless of whether your internet provider provides you with IPv4 or IPv6 (or both) connectivity. With home IPv4 connectivity there is typically NAT between the public internet and your private network that blocks inbound connections by default. If your ISP also provides you with IPv6 connectivity, that's typically not the case (afaik) and you really need to make sure your firewall (OpenWRT) has specific IPv6 rules in place to block all inbound connections by default and only allow the connections you want.", "this pr was merged https://github.com/chaifeng/ufw-docker/pull/92" ],

Forked and cloned the repository, then searched the codebase for `readline` usage to find the core input handling logic.\n2.  Identified `useKeypress.ts` (for raw keypress events) and `InputPrompt.tsx` (for input logic) as the key files.\n3.  To see what the application receives, I temporarily modified the code to log every keypress event to a `debug.log` file.\n4.  **Key Finding:** My initial debugging proved that on a default macOS Terminal, `Shift+Enter` sends the exact same sequence (`\\r`) as a regular `Enter` press, making the two indistinguishable.\n\n### Attempted Fix & The Final Discovery\n\nBased on the initial finding, I attempted a code-only fix by teaching the application to listen for a different key combination, `Shift+Down`, which often sends a unique sequence on other terminals.\n\n1. The Code I Tested\nI modified `useKeypress.ts` to listen for the `Shift+Down` sequence (`\\x1b[1;2B`) and `InputPrompt.tsx` to handle a `key.shift` flag.\n\n```typescript\n// In useKeypress.ts, I added a check:\nif (key.sequence === '\\x1b[1;2B') {\n  key.name = 'return';\n  key.shift = true;\n}\n```\n```typescript\n// In InputPrompt.tsx, I added the key.shift check:\nif (key.ctrl || key.meta || key.shift || charBefore === '\\\\' || key.paste) {\n  // ... newline logic\n}\n```\n\n2. The Result: It Also Failed\nThis proof-of-concept did not work. To understand why, I used the `cat` command to see what my terminal was actually sending when I pressed `Shift+Down`.\nFinal Proof: The terminal sent `^[[B`, which is the standard escape code for a plain Cursor Down key.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis investigation leads to a definitive conclusion: the default macOS Terminal is more limited than anticipated. It appears to strip the `Shift` modifier information from both the `Enter` key and the arrow keys, making a code-only fix for a `Shift+Key` newline combination unfeasible on this specific platform, although i think this might work on other platforms which by default register shift + down as '\\x1b[1;2B' but i cant really test it.\n\nThis might explain why `Ctrl+J` is a common suggested alternative, as it sends a universal newline character (`\\n`) that doesn't rely on modifier key parsing.\n\nAs this is my first contribution, my analysis could be wrong, and I apologize for the detailed-but-failed attempt. Given these findings, what is the desired path forward? Any information from the internal `b.corp.google.com` link about how other terminals are supported would still be very helpful.\n\nThank you for your time and guidance.", "Just to add, I personally use the Warp Terminal on Mac.

This can result in a token length that exceeds the limits set by the system. Here are some steps you can take to address this issue:您在使用 Dify 中的 Volcengine 插件时遇到的 \"标记太长 \"错误可能与处理大数据输入（如转换为 base64 编码的图像）有关。这可能导致标记长度超出系统设置的限制。以下是解决此问题的一些步骤：\n> \n> 1. **Reduce Image Size**: Try reducing the size of the images before uploading them to Dify. This can help prevent the base64 encoded data from exceeding the token limit.**减小图片大小 **：在将图片上传到 Dify 之前，请尝试减小图片大小。这有助于防止 base64 编码数据超出令牌限制。\n> 2. **Check Token Limits**: Ensure that the token limits for your model and API requests are configured correctly. Dify imposes a generation length limit of 2k tokens for reasoning models, which might be relevant if your workflow involves such models [[1]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/17120).**检查令牌限制 **：确保正确配置模型和 API 请求的令牌限制。Dify 为推理模型规定了 2k 标记的生成长度限制，如果您的工作流涉及此类模型，则可能与此相关 [[1]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/17120) 。\n> 3. **Switch Model Provider**: If you're using the `openai_api_compatible` provider, consider switching to a different model provider that might handle larger token sizes more effectively [[2]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/18657).**切换模型提供程序 **：如果您正在使用 `openai_api_compatible` 提供程序，请考虑切换到不同的模型提供程序，这样可以更有效地处理更大的标记大小 [[2]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/18657) 。\n> 4. **Review Workflow Configuration**: Double-check your workflow configuration to ensure that all parameters and settings are optimized for handling the data sizes you're working with.**审查工作流程配置 **：仔细检查您的工作流程配置，确保所有参数和设置都经过优化，以处理您正在处理的数据大小。\n> \n> By implementing these suggestions, you should be able to mitigate the \"token too long\" error and improve the stability of your plugin operations.通过实施这些建议，您应该可以减少 \"标记太长 \"错误，并提高插件运行的稳定性。\n> \n> _To continue talking to [Dosu](https://dosu.dev), mention [@dosu](https://github.com/dosu).要继续与 [Dosu](https://dosu.dev) 通话，请提及 。_\n> \n> Help Dosu learn!

      "description" : "We are in the process of moving this repository to Read the Docs, and to do that we need to convert our pages from Markdown to RST. This issue is to transfer the Onboarding section: [https://contribute.mautic.org/on-boarding](https://contribute.mautic.org/on-boarding). You can also update and improve the content on these pages if you like - do check with the team leads first to ensure it's relevant.\r\n\r\nYou can do this in the current repo, as we've got a folder set up, `/docs`, which will be used for Read The Docs.\r\n\r\nYou can build this documentation locally by cloning this repository, and following these steps: https://github.com/mautic/user-documentation/tree/5.x?tab=readme-ov-file#build-documentation-locally. Change into the /docs folder and then (assuming you have DDEV and Docker/Colima installed) type `ddev config` and select `build/html `as the root folder when configuring DDEV. Then when complete, type `ddev start` and it'll give you the link to your local testing environment.\r\n\r\nIf you need to make a link file to add an external URL, please use the command line tool 'make link'. This will generate a reference macro and a link file for you.\r\n\r\nFor internal linking check the docs on using the [:ref: role](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/cross-referencing-with-sphinx.html#the-ref-role) for linking within the same document, and using [:doc: to link across pages](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/cross-referencing-with-sphinx.html#the-doc-role).\r\n\r\n**Please note: if you see folders called .revs these are old version control files from Grav. Ignore them! (they should be deleted) and instead work on the actual files.**\r\n\r\nWhen you've converted the file/s, **they need to live within the /docs folder**. We can create a structure using sub-folders to organise the sections. You also need to add the pages to the Table of Contents in the index.rst file for them to show on the menu. Docs on the ToC can be found [here](https://sublime-and-sphinx-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/indices.html).\r\nWe highly recommend that you use VS Code with Vale installed. Let us know if you have any problems.\r\n\r\nSome useful resources: \r\n- https://sublime-and-sphinx-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest guide to Sphinx/RST formatting\r\n- https://sublime-and-sphinx-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/references.html#use-the-external-links-extension how to do external links - always check the /docs/links directory first! You can use the terminal command '`make link`' to create the link file automagically.\r\n\r\nThere are many MD to RST tools out there which can help speed up the process, however you will still need to review your output to ensure it passes our Vale grammar rules. Headings must always be unique, as well.\r\n\r\nWe use the following for headings:\r\n\r\n```\r\nH1 ###\r\nH2 ***\r\nH3 ===\r\nH4 ---\r\nH5 ~~~\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease ask in #t-education on Slack if you get stuck with anything!",

I'm not sure what behavior clangd follows if there are different compile_flags.txt in subdirectories, but that could be a possible solution.\r\n\r\nThere's also the possibility of making a tool that generates compile_commands.json by traversing the specified source directories and creating entries with the proper arm7/arm9 flags, although something like [bear](https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear) could just be used instead (I've found it to be a bit finicky though).\r\n", "Personally, I just went for implementing `-MJ` in GCC; it's convenient but, again, this makes it incompatible with non-Wonderful toolchains, as it's a non-upstreamed patch." ],

Post a comment to this issue stating which package you're working on\n3. Do not just delete the package / function, do some research first\n   * find where (which PR) the function was introduced and what was using it & why\n   * ideally find the PR in which that usage was removed without removing the function itself\n   * post your findings in the comments to validate with maintainers that it's ok to delete\n",

      "description" : "# Background\n\n[crash](https://crash-utility.github.io/)'s command-oriented interface, while less flexible than drgn, has some distinct advantages:\n\n* For common operations, it is much more terse.\n* Many kernel developers are already comfortable with it.\n\nThere have also been requests for a crash-to-drgn translation guide. As a response, we are porting crash commands to drgn, adding a `--drgn` option to onboard users to drgn's more advanced functionality.\n\n# Contributing\n\nThe porting process is being tracked in https://github.com/users/osandov/projects/2. If you would like to work on a command, comment here (or reach out to @osandov) and we will create a new issue to track that command. Commands with many options can be split up further.\n\nCurrently, this work is in the `commands` branch, which is still a work in progress and will be rebased often. It will eventually be merged into the `main` branch.\n\n# Guidelines\n\n* The output format and behavior of each crash command should be recreated relatively closely in order to prioritize onboarding for crash users. However, we can deviate from crash if needed.\n* New functionality should be added as drgn helpers as much as possible. Ideally, commands should mainly call helpers and format output.\n* Every command should have a `--drgn` option that prints how to do the equivalent operation using drgn APIs.\n* Commands should be added to modules under `drgn/commands/_builtin/crash`. Feel free to create a new module if appropriate.\n* Test cases should be added under `tests/linux_kernel/crash_commands` for every command. Since most functionality should be in helpers with thorough unit tests, test cases for commands can be basic smoke tests.\n\nSee `_crash_cmd_mount()` in `drgn/commands/crash/_builtin/fs.py` and `TestMount` in `tests/linux_kernel/crash_commands/test_fs.py` for examples.",

      "description" : "### \uD83E\uDDED Epic\n\n**Title:** Configurable Connection-Retry Back-off for Database & Redis  \n**Goal:** Prevent gateway startup failures caused by slow-to-start services by making retry limits and intervals fully configurable. \n**Why now:** In containerised deployments Postgres (or any other SQL backend) and Redis often take several seconds to accept TCP connections. Today the gateway gives up on the first failure, crashing with `psycopg2.OperationalError: connection … refused`. Operators need a simple way—via environment variables, just like `DB_POOL_SIZE`, `CACHE_TYPE`, etc.—to tune how many times and how often the gateway retries before aborting.\n\n---\n\n### \uD83E\uDDED Type of Feature\n\n- [x] Enhancement to existing functionality\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDE4B‍♂️ User Story 1\n\n**As a:** DevOps engineer running MCP Gateway in Kubernetes  \n**I want:** to set `DB_MAX_RETRIES` and `DB_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS` for any SQLAlchemy-backed database  \n**So that:** the application patiently waits until the database container is ready, instead of crashing and restarting in a loop\n\n#### ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n```gherkin\nScenario: Database retries during startup\nGiven MCP Gateway starts with DB_MAX_RETRIES=10 and DB_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS=5000\nAnd the database is not yet ready\nWhen the first connection attempt fails\nThen the gateway should log \"DB connection failed (attempt 1/10), retrying in 5 s\"\nAnd it should retry every 5 s\nAnd after 10 failed attempts it should exit with a clear error message\n```\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDE4B‍♂️ User Story 2\n\n**As a:** Site Reliability Engineer using Redis caching  \n**I want:** analogous knobs `REDIS_MAX_RETRIES` and `REDIS_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS`  \n**So that:** the gateway’s cache layer behaves consistently with the database layer\n\n#### ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n```gherkin\nScenario: Redis retries respect custom settings\nGiven REDIS_MAX_RETRIES=15 and REDIS_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS=2000\nAnd Redis is unavailable\nWhen the cache subsystem initialises\nThen it must retry up to 15 times at 2 s intervals\nAnd surface a single aggregated error if all attempts fail\n```\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDE4B‍♂️ User Story 3\n\n**As a:** Platform administrator  \n**I want:** sensible defaults (3 retries × 2000 ms) so I don’t have to set anything for typical installs  \n**So that:** small deployments gain resilience out-of-the-box\n\n#### ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n```\n\nScenario: Defaults work when variables are unset\nGiven none of the four *_RETRIES or *_INTERVAL_MS variables are set\nWhen the gateway cannot reach the database\nThen it retries 3 times with 2 s between attempts\n\n```\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDCD0 Design Sketch (optional)\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\nsubgraph Settings\nENV[\".env / ENV vars\"]\nend\nENV --> Config[config.py load Settings]\nConfig -->|DB config| DBClient[SQLAlchemy Engine]\nConfig -->|Cache config| RedisClient[Redis Async Client]\n\nDBClient --> RetryLogic\nRedisClient --> RetryLogic\n\nRetryLogic{{\"Retry up to N timesnsleep(interval_ms)\"}}\nRetryLogic --> Logger\n```\n\n| Component | Change | Detail |\n|----------|--------|--------|\n| `config.py` | Add four `@env_settings` fields | `db_max_retries:int=3`, `db_retry_interval_ms:int=2000`, `redis_max_retries:int=3`, `redis_retry_interval_ms:int=2000` |\n| `db.py` | Wrap DB connect logic in retry loop | Use `asyncio.sleep()` for interval |\n| Redis cache init | Retry connect with same config | Applies if `CACHE_TYPE=redis` |\n| Logging | One log per retry attempt | Include attempt count and retry delay |\n| README | Add env var docs | Match style of existing DB/Redis config\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDD17 MCP Standards Check\n\n- [x] No protocol-level breaking changes\n- [x] Follows existing env var config conventions\n- [ ] Deviations: none\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDD04 Alternatives Considered\n\n| Alternative | Pros | Cons |\n|------------|------|------|\n| `docker-compose` healthcheck + `depends_on` | Simple for local dev | Doesn’t help bare-metal or k8s |\n| Exponential back-off | Faster in some cases | Adds complexity |\n| Gunicorn retry preload script | Works for some runners | Not general-purpose\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDCD3 Additional Context\n\n- Mirrors retry pattern used in `max_tool_retries`\n- Naming aligned with `DB_POOL_SIZE`, `CACHE_TYPE`, etc.\n- Ensure this is then changed in the helm chart.\n\nExample configuration:\n\n```bash\nexport DB_MAX_RETRIES=10\nexport DB_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS=5000\nexport REDIS_MAX_RETRIES=10\nexport REDIS_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS=5000\n```\n",

      "description" : "We are in the process of moving this repository to Read the Docs, and to do that we need to convert our pages from Markdown to RST. This issue is to transfer the Marketing team section: [https://contribute.mautic.org/marketing-team](https://contribute.mautic.org/marketing-team). You can also update and improve the content on these pages if you like - do check with the team lead (cc @sdoering and @tobsowo) first to ensure it's relevant.\r\n\r\nYou can do this in the current repo, as we've got a folder set up, `/docs`, which will be used for Read The Docs.\r\n\r\nYou can build this documentation locally by cloning this repository, and following these steps: https://github.com/mautic/user-documentation/tree/5.x?tab=readme-ov-file#build-documentation-locally. Change into the /docs folder and then (assuming you have DDEV and Docker/Colima installed) type `ddev config` and select `build/html `as the root folder when configuring DDEV. Then when complete, type `ddev start` and it'll give you the link to your local testing environment.\r\n\r\nIf you need to make a link file to add an external URL, please use the command line tool 'make link'. This will generate a reference macro and a link file for you.\r\n\r\nFor internal linking check the docs on using the [:ref: role](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/cross-referencing-with-sphinx.html#the-ref-role) for linking within the same document, and using [:doc: to link across pages](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/cross-referencing-with-sphinx.html#the-doc-role).\r\n\r\n**Please note: if you see folders called .revs these are old version control files from Grav. Ignore them! (they should be deleted) and instead work on the actual files.**\r\n\r\nWhen you've converted the file/s, **they need to live within the /docs folder**. We can create a structure using sub-folders to organise the sections. You also need to add the pages to the Table of Contents in the index.rst file for them to show on the menu. Docs on the ToC can be found [here](https://sublime-and-sphinx-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/indices.html).\r\n\r\nWe highly recommend that you use VS Code with Vale installed. Let us know if you have any problems.\r\n\r\nSome useful resources: \r\n- https://sublime-and-sphinx-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest guide to Sphinx/RST formatting\r\n- https://sublime-and-sphinx-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/references.html#use-the-external-links-extension how to do external links - always check the /docs/links directory first! You can use the terminal command '`make link`' to create the link file automagically.\r\n\r\nThere are many MD to RST tools out there which can help speed up the process, however you will still need to review your output to ensure it passes our Vale grammar rules. Headings must always be unique, as well.\r\n\r\nWe use the following for headings:\r\n\r\n```\r\nH1 ###\r\nH2 ***\r\nH3 ===\r\nH4 ---\r\nH5 ~~~\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease ask in #t-education on Slack if you get stuck with anything!",

This is not an acceptable UI, especially for core site functionality like upvoting.\n\n@ninakali Could you share which tool and setting you used to produce the screenshots? I've used a few over the years and would like to be certain we don't accidentally test with one that doesn't accurately reproduce your problem. The easiest way to ensure that would be to reuse.\n\nImplementor: If it's possible, I'd prefer not to change the 'brand' red upvoted color as it's core UI, though that's secondary to a functional UI. Or to say the reverse, maybe the best first approach would be to lighten the unvoted gray (though this may start looking like a disabled form element) or an outline.\n\n\nTo connect some context: \n\n#1494 is related and could be done with or separately from this fix. There is even an [insufficiently concerned](https://github.com/lobsters/lobsters/issues/1494#issuecomment-2740754925) comment from me that the proposal might not be accessible; I didn't consider the existing UI.\n\n#1090 is also about this UI but may be stale, I'll post more info there.", "I asked for help with this [in chat](https://lobste.rs/chat) and got a suggestion that's deploying now.

It is difficult to find the mode that would reflect my experience the best. In theory, I have protanomaly, that makes red shades appear less bright and \"green-ish\", but in practice, an image with \"protanomaly\" filter still looks somewhat different to an image without any filters. \"Achromatomaly\" mode looked right because I couldn't quite tell the difference between the image with this filter and without it under the light conditions I've had in my room at the moment. \n\nSide note: I feel like \"true tone\" setting set to \"On\" in MacOS might affect how I see colours. This is a default setting, so I prefer to keep it as is." ],

This increased use should bring more contributions as bug reports and feature proposals.\n\n### Regression test\n(Ensure the feature doesn't cause any regressions)\n- [ ] Write adequate test cases and submit test results\n- [ ] Test results should be reviewed by a person from the team\n\n### Links / references\n\n_Please note that this was taken from GitLab, to be changed accordingly_",

Please explain\n\n#6882 created a cache that sped up circuit construction if only \"append\" (or equivalent \"insert\" at end w/ EARLIEST strategy) was used. If other types of \"insert\", \"delete\", or any other circuit mutation was used (see instances of `_placement_cache = None`), the cache was simply deleted and subsequent mutations (including appends) fell back to the old \"check every moment\" algorithm.\n\n## Describe the solution you would prefer\n\nThere are probably some clever algorithms or data structures that could maintain the placement cache through more types of mutations. Or another option could be if the placement cache was deleted and subsequently the user calls a few \"appends\" in a row, to assume there are more coming and have some code that regenerates the placement cache a-priori.

      "description" : "## Background\r\n\r\nWhen debugging anything related to a device driver, the first step is often finding the `struct device` that represents the device in the kernel. One way to find a device is by its sysfs path. However, drgn doesn't currently have an easy way to do that. You can _kind of_ do it with something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> path = path_lookup(\"/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:06.0/0000:04:00.0/nvme/nvme0/nvme0n1\")\r\n>>> kn = cast(\"struct kernfs_node *\", path.dentry.d_inode.i_private)\r\n>>> kobject = cast(\"struct kobject *\", kn.priv)\r\n>>> device = container_of(kobject, \"struct device\", \"kobj\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this has a few issues:\r\n\r\n* Clearly it's not convenient at all.\r\n* `path_lookup()` walks the dentry cache, which may not be populated for a particular path depending on memory pressure.\r\n* `path_lookup()` doesn't resolve symlinks (yet, see #216), so you have to use the canonical path instead of a more convenient symlink like `/sys/block/nvme0n1`.\r\n\r\nInstead, we should improve our kernfs helpers and provide sysfs-specific helpers on top of those. This can be broken down into multiple smaller features.\r\n\r\n## kernfs\r\n\r\nsysfs is actually an instance of [kernfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernfs_(Linux)), which is generic infrastructure for pseudo file systems. A kernfs filesystem comprises a tree of [`struct kernfs_node`](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/include/linux/kernfs.h?id=1d227fcc72223cbdd34d0ce13541cbaab5e0d72f#n181), each of which represents a file or directory.\r\n\r\nWe already have a few basic helpers for inspecting kernfs: https://drgn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/helpers.html#kernfs. I would like two extensions to those:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add a `kernfs_children()` helper that returns an iterator over the children of a directory in kernfs. Children are represented by [`struct kernfs_node::dir::children`](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/include/linux/kernfs.h?id=1d227fcc72223cbdd34d0ce13541cbaab5e0d72f#n156).\r\n- [ ] Extend the `kernfs_walk()` helper to follow symlinks. These are represented by [`struct kernfs_node::symlink::target_kn`](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/include/linux/kernfs.h?id=1d227fcc72223cbdd34d0ce13541cbaab5e0d72f#n171). We should probably also have a `follow_symlinks` parameter that controls what we do if the last component of a path is a symlink, similar to the Python [`os`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#files-and-directories) module.\r\n\r\n## sysfs\r\n\r\nOnce we have the kernfs changes, we can add sysfs-specific helpers that use the new kernfs features.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add a `sysfs_lookup_node()` helper that returns the `struct kernfs_node *` at a given path.\r\n- [ ] Add a `sysfs_lookup()` helper that returns the actual object (e.g., `struct device *`, `struct bus *`, etc.) represented by a given path.\r\n- [ ] Add a `sysfs_listdir()` helper that lists the names of the children of a sysfs directory at a given path.",

It also provided ability for companies to run scripts on the EC2 machines securely using it's RunCommand feature. Adding SSM RunCommand Operator to the Amazon provider package will unlock migration to Airflow from legacy job scheduling frameworks like AutoSys\n\n### Use case/motivation\n\nI work with a few customers that are in the process of migrating jobs from AutoSys and other legacy frameworks to Airflow. For these customers, a lot of their existing jobs are in shell scripts running on EC2. When they migrate to Airflow, they are looking for an easy way to lift those scripts and run on Airflow. SSHOperator could be an option for this but in many corporate environments, SSH is disabled for security reasons. One of the secure ways AWS recommends executing a remote script on EC2 is by using SSM RunCommand.\n\n### Related issues\n\n_No response_\n\n### Are you willing to submit a PR?\n\n- [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n",

And seemingly it needs more symbols now, than it needed previously. \r\n\r\nWe ran into this today with the blender deps build (no fix as of yet), but this broke somewhere between 1.13.7.0 and the 1.14 beta \r\n\r\n", "Presumably caused by #1890.", "Potential fix in #1918, can someone check if it works?", "works\r\n ", "Okay sweet, and thanks. I will try pulling in the latest changes soon, and seeing if my CI completes it's build with that fix. How should I go about getting permission to push my commit with the updated CI? And I assume the one that uses the version of OpenImageIO that doesn't require boost, is the commit I should be pushing.", "Sorry for the wait on this. After getting the release version of the build setup and working, I moved onto the debug version but ran into some issues which came to a head at pybind11's debug build. This issue gave me a lot of trouble, and I meant to come back to it eventually for a better look later but got caught up in other work. \n\nAnyway I made mention of the issue in the commit I made on my own fork of the repo, but essentially a repeating error of \"IMPORTED_LOCATION not set for important target\" is given for a variety of targets such as: \"pybind11::module\", \"pybind11::thin_lto\", \"pybind11::windows_extras\", \"pybind11::pybind11\", etc.\n\nI believe the reason for this error may be resolved by editing the CMake code regarding pybind11, but if that is the solution then that is something I don't feel comfortable editing. Since all of my focus has been within the build_install directory, when I have had the time to work on this issue.\n\nI continued the debug build past pybind11 by removing it from the list of dependencies to build, and the other dependencies were able to build just fine including the final OSL build. There is one additional error regarding glut.h not being copied into the proper folder, but I gave a list of steps to follow regarding copying the file into it's correct folder (in the Readme). That file is needed by Partio, during it's build.\n\nBesides that I updated various versions of the dependencies, added IMath to build_osl.py, and updated the ReadMe for the build with this new information, including what dependencies needed to be installed by the user and which would automatically be installed by running the Release and Debug versions of the build_osl.bat script. Let me know if there's any other information you need, or anything regarding procedure In need to do for the commit of this issue.\n\nThanks,\nNate" ],

      "description" : "### Proposal summary\n\nWe like to extend the existing evaluation metrics to include a new metric called \"Trajectory Accuracy\". Esentially we are evaluating ReAct style agents by reasoning about the sequence of actions taken and their outcomes. Based on the paper “ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models” https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629. You can also see the Langchain implementation here:\n- https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/evaluation/langchain.evaluation.agents.trajectory_eval_chain.TrajectoryEvalChain.html\n- https://github.com/langchain-ai/agentevals/tree/main/python/agentevals/trajectory\n\nExample of an existing judge metric (Hallucination) is defined here:\n- Docs: https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/evaluation/metrics/hallucination\n- Docs Code: https://github.com/comet-ml/opik/blob/main/apps/opik-documentation/documentation/fern/docs/evaluation/metrics/hallucination.mdx\n- Python SDK: https://github.com/comet-ml/opik/tree/main/sdks/python/src/opik/evaluation/metrics/llm_judges/hallucination\n- Python Examples: https://github.com/comet-ml/opik/blob/main/sdks/python/examples/metrics.py\n- Frontend: https://github.com/comet-ml/opik/blob/main/apps/opik-frontend/src/constants/llm.ts\n\nIdeally this is implemented as an LLM-as-a-judge. Expectation is the new judge is added to the frontend for using LLM-as-a-judge from the UI (Online Evaluation tab) as well as in the Python SDK. The appropriate docs needs to be updated and a video attached of the metric working.\n\nReturn should be float (0-1), and if its using LLM as a eval then should also contain a \"reason/explanation\"\n\n### Motivation\n\nI would like to see more robust set of metrics and evaluations based on recent research.",

      "description" : "### Application\n\nOutline Manager\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nWhen using GCP option in \"ADD SERVER\" tab the app hangs on create server step. \nThe problem is connected to missing `projects/ubuntu-os-cloud/global/images/family/ubuntu-2004-lts` image that should be used when creating a compute engine instance. \n\nIn GCP logs for compute engine the following error message can be found:\n```\nThe resource 'projects/ubuntu-os-cloud/global/images/family/ubuntu-2004-lts' was not found\n```\nFor reference see [Operating system details](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/os-details#ubuntu_lts) section of Compute Engine Documentation. It clearly states that EOS and image deprecation date for tis image is May 2025. \n\nI suspect the error can be easily fixed by updating [this line](https://github.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-apps/blob/55d09c01704909e1142fd14e2a91d5525872efd0/server_manager/www/gcp_account.ts#L275), but I'm not sure what image is to be used (otherwise I could try to open a PR). \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. open Outline Manager\n2. connect to GCP account\n3. create a project using \"ADD SERVER\" tab\n4. create server using on of the locations (same behaviour is observed for multiple server locations)\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\nSuccessfully completed addition of new server as it was before.\n\n### What actually happened?\n\nI've tried to create a new GCP server using the respective option in \"ADD SERVER\" tab. \n\n### Outline Version\n\n1.17.2\n\n### What operation system are you using?\n\nmacOS\n\n### Operating System Version\n\nSonoma 14.6.1\n\n### Screenshots and Videos\n\n_No response_",

Still, there are things like the output files, the probes, data transfer between simulation -> post_process, and so on. \n\nThe code is not so hard to refactor, but there are some areas that are concerning. I suspect that #914 is a side effect of me or someone else's PR (I could be wrong). This case simply wasn't tested in CI appropriately.\n\nThere is a tango required to get decent tests without overfitting to specific computers or spending 10 hours in CI running (plus another 10 hours queuing in some cases). But I would rather have good tests so we can more confidently refactor and add features than be cavalier about merging quite important changes into the code. \n\nAn example is #907 from @XZTian64 or #855 (and similar) from @Malmahrouqi3 and #901 from me. I'm not fully confident that nothing will go wrong in merging these, despite the tests. The ones that involve writing probes or post_process are most concerning at the moment, I think." ],

Environment: Use Jaeger 2.3.0 with OpenTelemetry \n2.  using curl http://127.0.0.1:8888/metrics\n3.  on prometheus server, we have added in location /etc/prometheus/rules/jaeger.rules.yml  but it is not working .\n4.  root@virtplatform:~# cat /etc/prometheus/rules/jaeger.rules.yml\n```\ngroups:\n- name: jaeger_alerts\n  rules:\n    - alert: PromHttpMetricErrs\n      annotations:\n        message: |\n           {{ $labels.job }} {{ $labels.instance }} is experiencing {{ printf \"%.2f\" $value }}% HTTP errors.\n      expr: 100 * sum(rate(promhttp_metric_handler_errors_total[1m])) by (instance, job ) / sum(rate(http_server_duration_milliseconds_sum[1m])) by (instance, job)> 1\n      for: 15m\n      labels:\n        severity: warning\n\n    - alert: OtelReceiverRefusedSpans\n      annotations:\n        message: |\n          service {{ $labels.job }} {{ $labels.instance }} is dropping {{ printf \"%.2f\" $value }}% spans.\n      expr: 100 * sum(rate(otelcol_receiver_refused_spans_total[1m])) by (instance, job) / sum(rate(jaeger_reporter_spans[1m])) by (instance, job)> 1\n      for: 15m\n      labels:\n        severity: warning\n```\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nIt is should be expected like below sample.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac5dbf91-5e05-48d8-b24d-5a61d90c2713)\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```shell\n\n```\n\n### Screenshot\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Jaeger backend version\n\nv2.3.0\n\n### SDK\n\n_No response_\n\n### Pipeline\n\n_No response_\n\n### Stogage backend\n\n_No response_\n\n### Operating system\n\n_No response_\n\n### Deployment model\n\n_No response_\n\n### Deployment configs\n\n```shell\n\n```",

This causes:\n\n- Confusing validation errors\n- Two conflicting rollout sources\n- A broken mental model\n\n---\n\n### Proposed Fix (shown in the prototype)\n\n1. User adds a scheduled rollout via the **Schedule** tab.\n2. Only after selecting a date and time, the release condition fields appear (progressive disclosure).\n3. The **Overview** tab updates to clearly show the scheduled rollout date and percentage.\n\nThis makes the state clear, avoids user errors, and reinforces the schedule as the single source of truth.\n\nLet me know your thoughts! Happy to refine it!", "I like it! However, we don't allow editing a schedule. So after you click \"Schedule\", we should probably reset the state of the form so a person can schedule their next change should they so choose. Keeping the rollout field around is confusing." ],

The version is never disabled and the secret is not removed at the end of the packer run though and this has implication if the key vault is being backed up (500 version limit on backups and performance impacts).\n\nIt would be nice to have an option to delete the secret at the end to avoid the potential for hitting the limit and to avoid the performance impact that their documentation notes.\n\n#### Use Case(s)\n\nAllow for meeting company policy dictating key vault security and backup requirements without impact.\n\n#### Potential configuration\n\n```\nbuild_key_vault_secret_delete = true \n```\n\n#### Potential References\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/service-limits#backup-keys-secrets-certificates\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/service-limits#limits-on-count-of-keys-secrets-and-certificates\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/keyvault/secrets/delete-secret/delete-secret?view=rest-keyvault-secrets-7.4&tabs=HTTP\n",

      "description" : "### \uD83D\uDE80 The feature, motivation and pitch\n\nI want to add a unit test for AOTI testing if user_managed weights works with load_state_dict.\n\nIt can follow a similar test https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/test/inductor/test_aot_inductor.py#L5733-L5835, but the new test is supposed to be simpler. \n\nUser managed is the last bool passed into update_constant_buffer:\nhttps://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/d5d14ee823e70224a154884a5c2912643d648094/torch/_C/_aoti.pyi#L28\n\n# Motivation:\n\nAOTI will take in an eager (i.e. un-compiled)model and spit out a AOTI Model that is compiled. update_constant_buffer is an api to update the weights of such model. If we set user_managed=True, the new weights that we are passing in should just point to the tensors (i.e. no copy is done). So ideally, if we update the tensors we passed it, the changes should reflect on the AOTI model. This is already tested in test_update_user_managed_buffer.\n\nWhat I want to see tested is if we:\n1. pass in the model weights to AOTI model with user managed\n2. Update the eager model weights with load_state_dict\n3. Check if the update is reflected on the AOTI model.\n\n### Alternatives\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\ncc @chauhang @penguinwu @avikchaudhuri @gmagogsfm @zhxchen17 @tugsbayasgalan @angelayi @suo @ydwu4 @desertfire @chenyang78 @yushangdi @benjaminglass1",

Is it still relevant or not?", "From what I can tell, we could introduce a new configuration option to truncate large data fields within the ValueObject property. A good place to implement this might be here:\n\uD83D\uDC49 https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/blob/master/pkg/apis/application/v1alpha1/values.go#L34.\n\nIf the serialized data at this point (https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/blob/master/pkg/apis/application/v1alpha1/values.go#L20) is too large, we could truncate it accordingly.\n\nAdditionally, I'm considering introducing levels of truncation for deeply nested JSON structures. For this, we could add a --log-json-max-depth configuration flag. For example, if --log-json-max-depth=2, everything deeper than 2 levels would be replaced with a placeholder like \"...(truncated)\".\n\nGiven the following example:\n```\n{\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"name\": \"app\",\n    \"labels\": {\n      \"env\": \"prod\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"spec\": {\n    \"containers\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"nginx\",\n        \"resources\": {\n          \"limits\": {\n            \"cpu\": \"500m\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\nWith --log-json-max-depth=2, it would become:\n```\n{\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"name\": \"app\",\n    \"labels\": \"...(truncated)\"\n  },\n  \"spec\": {\n    \"containers\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"nginx\",\n        \"resources\": \"...(truncated)\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\nThis would allow users to control how much detail they want to include in logs, preventing overly verbose output while retaining useful context.
