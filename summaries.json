      "description" : "## \uD83D\uDCDD Issue Description\n\nThis issue aims to add `@DisplayName()` annotations for **every test method** in the test files of all **practice exercises** in the Java track.\n\n### \uD83D\uDD27 What You Need to Do\n\n1. **Skip unsynced exercises:**  \n   Before starting, make sure the exercise is **not** listed among the ones with unsynced tests in [issue #2959](https://github.com/exercism/java/issues/2959).\n\n2. **Locate the test file:**\n   - Go to the exercise folder inside `exercises/practice/<exercise-name>/src/test`.\n   - Open the Java test file (typically named `<ExerciseName>Test.java`).\n\n3. **Find the canonical source:**\n   - Navigate to the [problem-specifications](https://github.com/exercism/problem-specifications) repo.\n   - Open the corresponding exercise folder and locate `canonical-data.json`.\n\n4. **Match and annotate tests:**\n   - The test cases in the `.json` file are listed in a specific order.\n   - Match the tests in the Java file with the ones in `canonical-data.json`.\n   - For each test, copy the `\"description\"` and use it as a `@DisplayName(\"\")` annotation above the corresponding method in the Java test file.\n\n## ?????? Important Guidelines\n\n- **Max 15 exercises per PR:**  \n  To avoid large PRs, limit the number of exercises being updated in each PR to a maximum of 15 exercises (less is ok too). \n  \n- **Do not close this issue via PRs:**  \n  Avoid referencing this issue in your PR with terms like `Fixes #XXX` or `Resolves #XXX`, since this would automatically close the issue. \n\n- **Avoid reimplemented exercises:**  \n  Make sure you are not copying descriptions from tests that have been reimplemented.\n\n- **Need help?**  \n  If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the comments!\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDCCB Checklist of Practice Exercises\n\n- [ ] acronym\n- [ ] affine-cipher\n- [ ] all-your-base\n- [ ] allergies\n- [ ] alphametics\n- [ ] anagram\n- [ ] armstrong-numbers\n- [ ] atbash-cipher\n- [ ] bank-account\n- [ ] binary-search-tree\n- [ ] binary-search\n- [ ] bob\n- [ ] book-store\n- [ ] bottle-song\n- [ ] bowling\n- [ ] change\n- [ ] circular-2buffer\n- [ ] clock\n- [ ] collatz-conjecture\n- [ ] complex-numbers\n- [ ] connect\n- [ ] crypto-square\n- [ ] custom-set\n- [ ] darts\n- [ ] diamond\n- [ ] difference-of-squares\n- [ ] dnd-character\n- [ ] dominoes\n- [ ] dot-dsl\n- [ ] eliuds-eggs\n- [ ] error-handling\n- [ ] etl\n- [ ] flatten-array\n- [ ] flower-field\n- [ ] food-chain\n- [ ] forth\n- [ ] game-of-life\n- [ ] gigasecond\n- [ ] go-counting\n- [ ] grade-school\n- [ ] grains\n- [ ] grep\n- [ ] hamming\n- [ ] hangman\n- [ ] hello-world\n- [ ] high-scores\n- [ ] house\n- [ ] isbn-verifier\n- [ ] isogram\n- [ ] killer-sudoku-helper\n- [ ] kindergarten-garden\n- [ ] knapsack\n- [ ] largest-series-product\n- [ ] leap\n- [ ] ledger\n- [ ] linked-list\n- [ ] list-ops\n- [ ] luhn\n- [ ] markdown\n- [ ] matching-brackets\n- [ ] matrix\n- [ ] mazy-mice\n- [ ] meetup\n- [ ] micro-blog\n- [ ] nth-prime\n- [ ] nucleotide-count\n- [ ] ocr-numbers\n- [ ] palindrome-products\n- [ ] pangram\n- [ ] parallel-letter-frequency\n- [ ] pascals-triangle\n- [ ] perfect-numbers\n- [ ] phone-number\n- [ ] piecing-it-together\n- [ ] pig-latin\n- [ ] poker\n- [ ] pov\n- [ ] prime-factors\n- [ ] protein-translation\n- [ ] proverb\n- [ ] pythagorean-triplet\n- [ ] queen-attack\n- [ ] rail-fence-cipher\n- [ ] raindrops\n- [ ] rational-numbers\n- [ ] react\n- [ ] rectangles\n- [ ] relative-distance\n- [ ] resistor-color-duo\n- [ ] resistor-color-trio\n- [ ] resistor-color\n- [ ] rest-api\n- [ ] reverse-string\n- [ ] rna-transcription\n- [ ] robot-name\n- [ ] robot-simulator\n- [ ] roman-numerals\n- [ ] rotational-cipher\n- [ ] run-length-encoding\n- [ ] saddle-points\n- [ ] satellite\n- [ ] say\n- [ ] scrabble-score\n- [ ] secret-handshake\n- [ ] series\n- [ ] sgf-parsing\n- [ ] sieve\n- [ ] simple-cipher\n- [ ] simple-linked-list\n- [ ] space-age\n- [ ] spiral-matrix\n- [ ] square-root\n- [ ] state-of-tic-tac-toe\n- [ ] sublist\n- [ ] sum-of-multiples\n- [x] swift-scheduling\n- [ ] tournament\n- [ ] transpose\n- [ ] tree-building\n- [ ] triangle\n- [ ] twelve-days\n- [ ] two-bucket\n- [ ] two-fer\n- [ ] variable-length-quantity\n- [ ] word-count\n- [ ] word-search\n- [ ] wordy\n- [ ] yacht\n- [ ] zebra-puzzle\n- [ ] zipper\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDCA1 Reference Example\n\nTo understand how to properly add `@DisplayName` annotations based on `canonical-data.json`, you can refer to the test file in the [Swift Scheduling exercise](https://github.com/exercism/java/tree/main/exercises/practice/swift-scheduling/src/test/java).\n\nIt already includes correctly formatted `@DisplayName` entries matching the test case descriptions, making it a good template for how your test file should look after the changes.",

I understand the guidelines about:\n\n- Limiting to max 15 exercises per PR\n- Checking the unsynced exercises list in issue #2959 \n- Matching test descriptions from canonical-data.json\n- Not closing the issue via PR references\n\nI'm planning to start with a smaller batch (maybe 5-10 exercises) for my first PR to get comfortable with the workflow, then continue with additional PRs as needed.\nCould you please assign me to this issue? I'm excited to contribute and help improve the Java track's test documentation!\nThanks!", "Thanks for taking this on @EmmanuelBerkowicz! I have just assigned this one to you." ],

This would be consistent with how the Linux `cp` works.\n```\n% cp 0.json tmp/\ncp: directory tmp does not exist\n```\n\nInstead, this command creates a file called mydir with the contents of hello.txt.\n\nAnother option is to transparently create mydir. The Files API has the behaviour that it is supposed to create directories that don???t exist when uploading a file. \n\nThe cp should differentiate between whether the target is a file or a directory based on the trailing slash.\n\n### Is this a regression?\nNo",

No such file or directory. **But when using Redis Client directly it run successfully.** The problem just occur out of no where, last week I still using the `redis_hook.get_conn()` and normally call redis function just fine.\n\n`apache-airflow-providers-redis` and `redis` version\n\n```bash\nairflow@fb8a120ed440:/opt/airflow$ pip freeze | grep redis\napache-airflow-providers-redis==4.0.2\ngoogle-cloud-redis==2.18.1\nredis==5.2.1\n```\n\nredis connection configs:\n\nconnection_id: redis\nhost: redis\npassword: None\n\n```json\n{\n  \"db\": 0,\n  \"ssl\": false,\n  \"ssl_cert_reqs\": \"required\",\n  \"ssl_ca_certs\": null,\n  \"ssl_keyfile\": null,\n  \"ssl_certfile\": null,\n  \"ssl_check_hostname\": false\n}\n```\n\nWhat I have tried: \n1) Create a folder `/var/run/redis` inside the container https://github.com/redis/redis/issues/8081\n2) Try different versions of `apache-airflow-providers-redis` and `redis`\n  - upgrade the `apache-airflow-providers-redis` version to 4.1.0 while using `redis==5.2.1`\n  - upgrade the redis version to `redis==6.2.0`\n3) run `docker compose down -v` then `docker system prune`, rebuild the docker-compose and rerun anything again. problem still persists\n4) As stated earlier, I have tried using Redis Client directly it connect and excute successfully\n\nThe Test code:\n```python\n# Get Redis connection from Airflow connection\nredis_hook = RedisHook(redis_conn_id=\"redis\")\n\n# Get connection parameters for logging\nconn_params = redis_hook.get_connection(redis_hook.redis_conn_id)\nlogger.info(f\"Redis connection parameters: host={conn_params.host}, port={conn_params.port}, password {conn_params.password}\")\n\nlogger.info(\"Getting redis client using redis_hook.get_conn()\")\nredis_client = redis_hook.get_conn()\nlogger.info(\"Successfully connected to Redis\")\n# Test connection with ping\nlogger.info(\"Pinging Redis to test connection...\")\nping_result = redis_client.ping()\nlogger.info(f\"Redis ping result: {ping_result}\")\n```\n\nThe logs:\n\n```bash\n[2025-06-07, 19:00:46] INFO - DAG bundles loaded: dags-folder: source=\"airflow.dag_processing.bundles.manager.DagBundlesManager\"\n[2025-06-07, 19:00:46] INFO - Filling up the DagBag from /opt/airflow/dags/video_processing_dag.py: source=\"airflow.models.dagbag.DagBag\"\n[2025-06-07, 19:00:46] WARNING - /opt/airflow/dags/video_processing_dag.py:174: UserWarning: `multiple_outputs=True` is not supported in @task.bash tasks.

      "comments" : [ "# :wave: Important: PLEASE READ :wave:\n\nThis issue has been labeled as a **good first issue** and is available for anyone to work on.\n\nIf this is your first time contributing to an open source project, some aspects of the development process may seem unusual, arcane, or some combination of both.\n\n1.  **You cannot \"claim\" issues.** People new to open source often want to \"claim\" or be assigned an issue before beginning work. The typical rationale is that people want to avoid wasted work in the event that someone else ends up working the issue. However, this practice is not effective in open source, as it often leads to \"issue squatting\", in which an individual asks to be assigned, is granted their request, and then never ends up working on the issue. Accordingly, you are encouraged to communicate your intent to address this issue, ideally by providing a rough outline as to how you plan to address the issue or asking clarifying questions, but, at the end of the day, we will take running code and rough consensus in order to move forward quickly.\n2.  **We have a very high bar for contributions.** We have very high standards for contributions and expect all contributions???whether new features, tests, or documentation???to be rigorous, thorough, and complete. Once a pull request is merged into stdlib, that contribution immediately becomes the collective responsibility of all maintainers of stdlib. When we merge code into stdlib, we are saying that we, the maintainers, commit to reviewing subsequent changes and making bugfixes to the code. Hence, in order to ensure future maintainability, this naturally leads to a higher standard of contribution.\n\nBefore working on this issue and opening a pull request, please read the project's [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md). These guidelines and the associated [development guide](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/docs/contributing/development.md) provide important information, including links to stdlib's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), license policy, and steps for setting up your local development environment.\n\nTo reiterate, we **strongly** encourage you to refer to our contributing guides **before** beginning work on this issue. Failure to follow our guidelines significantly decreases the likelihood that you'll successfully contribute to stdlib and may result in automatic closure of a pull request without review.\n\nSetting up your local development environment is a critical first step, as doing so ensures that automated development processes for linting, license verification, and unit testing can run prior to authoring commits and pushing changes. If you would prefer to avoid manual setup, we provide pre-configured [development containers](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/tree/develop/.devcontainer) for use locally or in GitHub Codespaces.\n\nWe place a high value on consistency throughout the stdlib codebase. We encourage you to closely examine other packages in stdlib and attempt to emulate the practices and conventions found therein.\n\n-   If you are attempting to contribute a new package, sometimes the best approach is to simply copy the contents of an existing package and then modify the minimum amount necessary to implement the feature (e.g., changing descriptions, parameter names, and implementation).\n-   If you are contributing tests, find a package implementing a similar feature and emulate the tests of that package.\n-   If you are updating documentation, examine several similar packages and emulate the content, style, and prose of those packages.\n\nIn short, the more effort you put in to ensure that your contribution looks and feels like stdlib???including variables names, bracket spacing, line breaks, etc???the more likely that your contribution will be reviewed and ultimately accepted. We encourage you to closely study the codebase **before** beginning work on this issue.\n\n:sparkles: Thank you again for your interest in stdlib, and we look forward to reviewing your future contributions. :sparkles:\n" ],

In this issue, we want to improve the UI, add the company logos to it. We still want to maintain all functionality. \n\n<img width=\"1115\" height=\"487\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98396644-714d-42cb-80be-01e2c9a7b3be\" />\n\n## How to fix\n1. The settings page lives in `SettingsTab.tsx`. Each individual expandable card is a `ProviderSection.tsx` component. \n2. Refactor the UI of the card, while still maintaining its core functionality. Make the UI minimalist and simple to use. \n3. Add Claude / OpenAI logos to the cards (this is a nice plus) \n\n## First time contributing?\nPlease checkout our [CONTRIBUTIONS.md](https://github.com/MCPJam/inspector/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions on how to set up as a contributor.",

Luckily the AI search bot will provide a clue when prompting it \"loginWithToken\", linking to a guide page about sharing authentication using a new AccountsClient instance `accounts2.loginWithToken`, from which can be inferred that `Accounts.loginWithToken` exists.\n\nOne thing that isn't clear though is that it does not accept an expiry value. So what happens if calling that on multi clients in the same machine in the same browser. Will they all have differing expiration dates?\n\nFor example suppose I have two separate clients at ex.com and sub.ex.com and when one logs in I set `Meteor.loginToken` on the other using a temporary iframe, then the other detects the added token and calls `Accounts.loginWithToken`. I think they'll both be signed in, but Meteor will try to set a new expiry for the new login I'm guessing. \n\nPlaying with this right now...", "... oh cool, after playing with it, I noticed that Meteor is already polling local storage on the client for a `Meteor.loginToken`, so all I need to do is simply call `localStorage.setItem('Meteor.loginToken', '....')` and Meteor detects it, and I see that Meteor will have the same expiration value on both clients (guessing it must've got that from the server). Cool! That's real easy! Don't even need `Accounts.loginWithToken` for this (multi-client auth on differing subdomains).", "\uD83D\uDC4B @italojs This issue has been open for 60 days with no activity.

If you have a lot of vectors it can often be difficult / annoying to view since it's just a bunch of blue on your screen. I think having something like this, but making it toggleable could be very nice! You can view a before & after of my mockup below.\n\n<img width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/125bee13-1d3b-4280-86bd-d15e5c369cd3\" />\n<img width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d845cc2b-2673-46a3-9089-c4788611c4d7\" />\n\nin my opinion, my mockup makes it much nicer to view, and having this as an option instead of being required could be really beneficial.",

The stratify transformer's code naively reverses the circuit by reversing moments, but does not reverse the operations within moments, which does matter because multiple interactions with the same measurement key are allowed in a single moment, and they will be sequenced in the order that they're added to the moment. https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/a89f5b9f0875dcae419efc13790af078075fcb6b/cirq-core/cirq/transformers/stratify.py#L83-L90.\n\n#6899 fixed this for the `align_right` transformer, reversing the operations within each moment when it reversed the circuit. So the same fix should be applied here. It's probably worth creating a `Circuit.reverse()` method to avoid copy-paste, and to reduce the likelihood of this happening in the future.\n\nThe example attached to the issue produces a huge circuit after transforming. Here's a much simpler one. \n\n```python\n    q0, q1 = cirq.LineQubit.range(2)\n    circuit =  cirq.Circuit([\n        cirq.measure(q0, key='c'),\n        cirq.X(q1).with_classical_controls(\"c\"),\n        cirq.X(q0).with_classical_controls(\"c\"),\n        cirq.X(q1),\n    )\n    print(repr(circuit))\n    circuit = stratified_circuit(circuit)\n    print(repr(circuit))\n\n    simulator = cirq.Simulator()\n    simulator.run(circuit)\n```\n\nNote this bug has nothing to do with subcircuits.\n", "Hi, if no one else is currently working on this issue I'd like to pick it up.", "After creating a Circuit.reverse() method, would it be in scope for this issue to search for naive reversing of circuits and replace those with the new Circuit.reverse() method? Or would it be better to open a new issue for that refactoring?" ],

", "As far as I remember my concern was that unlike our polling, using the rpcwait option does not allow us to enforce a deadline of 60s, i.e., it just waits indefinitely. In LN we need to have access to the Bitcoin backend and the rpcwait option just waiting silently indefinitely is bad. We exit loudly (some refer to it as crash, but we make noise so operators are notified) if we can't talk to the Bitcoin backend.

It is a for loop that just waits indefinitely with a hard coded sleep(1). Adding a 60s deadline wouldn't be much of an issue with -rpcwait as well as without. In the meantime I propose the following:\n\n```c\nstatic void wait_and_check_bitcoind(struct plugin *p)\n{\n\tint in, from, status, ret;\n\tpid_t child;\n\tconst char **cmd = gather_args(bitcoind, \"-rpcwait\", \"getnetworkinfo\", NULL);\n\tchar *output = NULL;\n\n\tchild = pipecmdarr(&in, &from, &from, cast_const2(char **, cmd));\n\n\tif (bitcoind->rpcpass)\n\t\twrite_all(in, bitcoind->rpcpass, strlen(bitcoind->rpcpass));\n\tclose(in);\n\n\tif (child < 0) {\n\t\tif (errno == ENOENT)\n\t\t\tbitcoind_failure(p, \"bitcoin-cli not found.

      "description" : "### **Description**\nWhen using the Flow browser, resizing the **browser's own sidebar** triggers a chain of multiple favicon requests (`GET /favicon.ico`). These requests are visible in the server logs but **do not appear in the browser's Network tab** of the developer tools, suggesting they may be internal browser requests or handled differently by Flow browser.\n\n### **Environment**\n- **Browser**: Flow browser 0.8.3\n- **Framework**: Next.js application\n- **Observation method**: Server logs (not visible in browser DevTools Network tab)\n- **OS: macOS 15.5.0**\n\n### **Steps to Reproduce**\n1. Open the application in Flow browser\n2. Monitor server logs for favicon requests\n3. Resize the Flow browser's sidebar (the browser's native sidebar panel)\n4. Observe the server logs showing multiple consecutive favicon requests\n5. **Note**: These requests will NOT be visible in the browser's DevTools Network tab\n\n### **Expected Behavior**\nThe favicon should be requested once when the page loads, and browser sidebar resizing should not trigger additional favicon requests.\n\n### **Actual Behavior**\nMultiple consecutive favicon requests are triggered when resizing the Flow browser's sidebar, visible only in server logs:\n\n```\nGET /favicon.ico 200 in 27ms\nGET /favicon.ico 200 in 24ms\nGET /favicon.ico 200 in 26ms\nGET /favicon.ico 200 in 28ms\n[... dozens more requests ...]\n```\n\n**Important**: These requests are **not visible in the browser's Network tab** in developer tools, which suggests they may be:\n- Internal browser requests\n- Handled by a different network stack\n- Cached requests that still hit the server\n- Background requests not exposed to the page context\n\n### **Technical Details**\n\n**Favicon Configuration:**\n```typescript\n// app/layout.tsx\nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\n  title: \"app title\",\n  description: \"some description\", \n  icons: {\n    icon: \"/favicon.ico\",\n  },\n};\n```\n\n### **Investigation Notes**\nThe fact that these requests are invisible to the browser's Network tab is particularly concerning as it suggests:\n- Flow browser has internal processes making requests outside the normal page context\n- This could be a security/privacy concern if other resources are being requested invisibly\n- Standard web debugging tools cannot detect this behavior\n\n### **Impact**\n- Unnecessary server load from repeated favicon requests\n- Hidden network activity that developers cannot easily monitor\n- Potential impact on server costs for high-traffic applications\n- Debugging difficulty due to requests being invisible in standard tools\n",

      "description" : "### Goal\n\nSo far, Intlayer is only available for React environments.  \nHowever, Intlayer aims to support Vue and other frameworks as well.\n\nThe goal would be to implement the `vue-intlayer` package by using `react-intlayer` as a reference.\n\n`react-intlayer`: https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/tree/main/packages/react-intlayer\n`vue-intlayer`: https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/tree/main/packages/vue-intlayer\n\n### Code to implement:\n\n- An equivalent of `IntlayerProvider` to maintain the selected language in the app???s context:  \n  https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/blob/main/packages/react-intlayer/src/client/IntlayerProvider.tsx\n\n- An equivalent of the `useLocale` hook, allowing users to change the language:  \n  https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/blob/main/packages/react-intlayer/src/client/useLocale.ts\n\n- Equivalents of the `useDictionary` and `useIntlayer` hooks to access Intlayer dictionaries within Vue components:  \n  https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/blob/main/packages/react-intlayer/src/client/useDictionary.ts  \n  https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/blob/main/packages/react-intlayer/src/client/useIntlayer.ts\n   > For `getDictionary` and `getIntlayer` functions, skip implementation of plugins in a first time. \n\n### Example app to update\n\nIn the monorepo, at https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/tree/main/examples/vite-vue-app, you will find an basic app Vite+Vue for demo. The purpose would be to internationalise this app using the `vue-intlayer` package.\n\n### Doc\n\nIn the monorepo, at https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/tree/main/docs/en/intlayer_with_vite+vue.md, you will find the documentation to set up intlayer in a Vue application. This doc will then be accessible publicly on the [official Intlayer online documentation](https://intlayer.org/doc) \n\n---\n\n### Going further:\n\n- Reproduce an equivalent of the **IntlayerNode** to connect the visual editor to a Vue app:  \n  https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/blob/main/packages/react-intlayer/src/IntlayerNode.tsx\n\n- Reproduce the plugin to render **IntlayerNode** components:  \n  https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/blob/main/packages/react-intlayer/src/plugins.tsx\n\n- Reproduce the plugin to render **Markdown content**:  \n  https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/blob/main/packages/react-intlayer/src/plugins.tsx  \n  https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/tree/main/packages/react-intlayer/src/markdown\n\n- Adapt the plugin to work with Nuxt\n\n---\n\nContribution guidline :\n\n- Fork + Clone the repo\n- Follow [contributing instruction](https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/tree/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n- Subit your PR\n- Contact for any help (ay.pineau@gmail.com)",

This could be done through a progress bar, dots, or a step indicator, and the tracker should dynamically update as the user progresses through the form's pages/screens. The goal is to make the user's progress clear and easily understandable, ensuring a smooth experience.\n\n### Why Is This Important\n- A visual progress indicator helps users understand where they are in the form and how many steps remain, reducing confusion.\n- The progress UI needs to be accessible, ensuring all users, including those with disabilities, can easily understand and track their progress.\n- Clear tracking of progress increases user satisfaction by providing transparency and reducing anxiety about completing the form.\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Implement a visual indicator showing the user???s current step in the form (ex. progress bar, dots or step indicator).\n- [ ] Ensure the tracker dynamically updates as the user moves through application pages/screens.\n- [ ] Make the application progress UI accessible and easy to understand.\n- [ ] Design is consistent with [Techtonica's branding guidelines](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/sb8ppa0qxuuott515euei/h?rlkey=1ghfh6urkf2rakbonngk9z3bd&st=xcbpfn8v&dl=0), if the design is not yet existent\n     - make a proposal for design and behavior that is in keeping with the existing design choices\n     - document design choice decision in a comment on this issue as well as in https://github.com/Techtonica/techtonica.org/issues/505\n\n### Related Tickets\n- Main Issue:  #389 \n- #556\n\n### Additional Notes\nThe person working on this issue may need to collaborate with whoever is handling issue #556 to ensure that the progress tracker integrates smoothly with the multi-page UI and save progress functionality.\n\nthis work will need to be pulled from the `mvp` branch and merged into the `mvp` branch\n\n",

      "description" : "### Overview\n\nWhat is the problem we're solving? For very simple items, this can be encapsulated in the success criteria.\n\nElsewhere we convert our units from thousand of dollars to dollars, and thousands of lbs to lbs. We haven't done consistently with all fields however. Notably, these fields are still in \"thousands of\" units:\n\n- `fgd_sorbent_consumption_1000_tons` (to be transformed in the `_core_eia923__fgd_operation_maintenance` function in `pudl.transform.eia923.py`)\n- `max_steam_flow_1000_lbs_per_hour` (to be transformed in the `_core_eia860__boilers` function in `pudl.transform.eia860.py`)\n- `steam_load_1000_lbs` (should be converted in the `pudl.extract.epacems.py` module)\n\n### Success Criteria\n\nHow will we know that we're done?\n\n* [ ] `fgd_sorbent_consumption_1000_tons` -> `fgd_sorbent_consumption_tons`\n* [ ] `max_steam_flow_1000_lbs_per_hour` -> `max_steam_flow_lbs_per_hour`\n* [ ] `steam_load_1000_lbs` -> `steam_load_lbs`\n\n### Get set up\n- [ ] Fork the PUDL repository and follow the steps to set up the [PUDL development environment](https://catalystcoop-pudl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/dev_setup.html)\n- [ ] Activate the pudl-dev environment: mamba activate pudl-dev\n- [ ] Grab the latest raw data for any relevant tables - in this case, EIA 860, EIA 923 and EPACEMS. To do so, run `pudl_datastore --dataset eia923`, ` pudl_datastore --dataset eia860`, and `pudl_datastore --dataset epacems` (the last one pulls a large chunk of data, and might take a while).\n- [ ] For the first two variables: First, generate the raw assets upstream of the transform: follow the instructions to [open Dagster](https://catalystcoop-pudl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/run_the_etl.html#running-the-etl-via-the-dagster-ui), and in the left-hand menu find the \"raw_eia923\" asset group, e.g.. Click \"Materialize all\".\n\n### Next steps\n* [ ] For each field, identify the first `_core` or `core` table in which it is transformed (see pudl.metadata.resources`).\n* [ ] In the corresponding transform function, divide this field by one thousand.\n* [ ] Update the field description, units and name\n* [ ] Update the [alembic schema](https://catalystcoop-pudl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/run_the_etl.html#database-schema-migration)\n- [ ] For the last variable: CEMS processing happens all in one step. To test your implemented solution, you'll simply need to find the \"core_epacems__hourly_emissions\" asset in the \"Asset\" tab, and materialize it. For the other two variables, you can generate the affected assets (e.g., `_core_eia923__FGD_operation_maintenance`) and inspect them in `devtools/inspect_assets.ipynb`.\n",

For the Dagster portion of the set-up, I clicked \"Materialize All\" for raw_eia923, but it looks like the run is queued and I am not sure how to complete it. Do I need to run etl_fast or something first? I am new to dagster, so I am not 100% sure what I need/will need to do.

I found the following tables that correspond to the three columns, `_core_eia923_fgd_operation_maintenance`, `core_eia860__scd_boilers`, and `core_epacems_hourly_emissions`, respectively. Would my next step be to create the draft PR and add the transform for the respective transform/extract.py you have listed above? \n3.

I'm here to assist you with any bugs, questions, or becoming a contributor. Let's tackle this together! \uD83E\uDD16\n\n<!-- Answer -->\nThe `local` provider does not perform font metric optimization because the current implementation does not support reading font metrics. This is indicated by a TODO comment in the code:\n\n```ts\n// TODO: support reading font metrics\n```\n\nThis means that while the `local` provider can register and resolve font files, it does not have the capability to optimize font metrics, which is why local fonts like Pretendard are not optimized. In contrast, fonts from Google, like Inter, are likely optimized because the Google provider includes font metric optimization <sup>[[1]](https://github.com/nuxt/fonts/blob/main/src/providers/local.ts)</sup><sup>[[2]](https://github.com/nuxt/fonts/blob/main/test/providers/local.test.ts)</sup>.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To continue talking to [Dosu](https://dosu.dev), mention @dosu.*\n", "Any ETA?", "In the meantime, is it recommended to use @nuxtjs/fontaine in addition to this module?" ],

      "comments" : [ "<!-- Answer -->\nYou're correct???there are significant mismatches between the datasets API documentation and the actual implementation, especially around the `weights` parameter. The backend expects `weights` to be a structured object (not a float), specifically a `WeightModel` with fields like `weight_type`, `vector_setting` (which itself includes `vector_weight`, `embedding_provider_name`, and `embedding_model_name`), and `keyword_setting` (with `keyword_weight`). The docs either omit this, describe it as a float, or provide no schema or example payload, making it hard to use advanced retrieval features without reading the code directly [[code reference 1]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/blob/f2f6e958805aaf90f2a1b70cc6eac4c4628c4383/api/services/entities/knowledge_entities/knowledge_entities.py) [[code reference 2]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/blob/f2f6e958805aaf90f2a1b70cc6eac4c4628c4383/api/controllers/service_api/dataset/dataset.py).\n\nNo recent docs or PRs address this gap, and there are no official workarounds documented. For now, the only way to use these features reliably is to follow the code's structure for your payloads. If you need a concrete example of the expected JSON structure for `weights`, let me know and I can provide one based on the implementation.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

      "description" : "As user, I can refine entry's data using a DOI. See https://docs.jabref.org/finding-sorting-and-cleaning-entries/getbibtexdatafromdoi#completing-information-based-on-doi-or-isbn for an example.\n\nThen, for any field, it could be possible that information is existing locally (\"Original entry\") and from the DOI (\"Entry from DOI\").\n\nExample:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30b445ac-c3e7-440f-a9da-6fdcdf36f616)\n\nHowever, sometimes, the local data is really wrong. In this example, the \"year\" (`1109`) and the \"Entrytype\" (`Misc`).\n\nThe dialog should select the data which could be more right. Here, \"Entrytype\" and \"Year\" should be selected from \"Entry from DOI\":\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c866899-9745-4b55-852d-dd1d8b27bfe4)\n\n### Task\n\n1. Find out how the Merge Entries Dialog is called\n2. Modify it to know that it knows that is called from \"get bibliographic data from DOI\" (or not)\n3. If called from \"get bibliographic data from DOI\", then it should go through all fields existing in both entries and select the ones more \"right\". Implement it for entry type (misc; != misc) and year. - Also use \"DOI\" from the \"DOI\" fetcher (if code-wise clean enough)\n4. Implement a class \"FieldValueValidityComparator\" implementing a comparator. The score returned is -, +, 0 depending if the left,, right value are \"better\" and 0 if the fields are equal or the comparator cannot tell\n5. Inherit from it for `YearFieldValueValidityComparator`.\n6. Use these comparators in the Merge Entries Dialog\n\n### Details\n\nThe dialog currently prioritizes the entry from the library. Sometimes, the data from the library is really wrong.\n\nExample:\n\n```bibtex\n@Misc{,\n  year      = {1109},\n  doi       = {10.1109/IPDPSW55747.2022.00093},\n  publisher = {IEEE},\n}\n```\n\n1. Wrong entry type\n2. Wrong year\n\nWhen the merge entries dialog is started, it should select the more propriate entry type (everything else as MISC is better) and the better year (if year differs more than 10 years, the \"new\" year should be taken)\n\n",

This flag could live next to the Wrap option\r\n\r\nThis could toggle from:\r\n```\r\n[2023-01-13, 21:01:12 UTC] {taskinstance.py:1284} INFO - Starting attempt 2 of 2\r\n[2023-01-13, 21:01:12 UTC] {taskinstance.py:1285} INFO - \r\n[2023-01-13, 21:01:12 UTC] {taskinstance.py:1304} INFO - Executing <Task(PythonOperator): group.task> on 2023-01-13 20:21:21+00:00\r\n[2023-01-13, 21:01:12 UTC] {taskinstance.py:1511} INFO - Exporting the following env vars:\r\n[2023-01-13, 21:01:20 UTC] {taskinstance.py:1322} INFO - Marking task as SUCCESS. dag_id=dag, task_id=group.task, execution_date=20230113T202121, start_date=20230113T210112, end_date=20230113T210120\r\n[2023-01-13, 21:01:21 UTC] {taskinstance.py:2582} INFO - 1 downstream tasks scheduled from follow-on schedule check\r\n```\r\nTo this:\r\n```\r\n- Starting attempt 2 of 2\r\n- \r\n- Executing <Task(PythonOperator): group.task> on 2023-01-13 20:21:21+00:00\r\n- Exporting the following env vars:\r\n- Marking task as SUCCESS. dag_id=dag, task_id=group.task, execution_date=20230113T202121, start_date=20230113T210112, end_date=20230113T210120\r\n- 1 downstream tasks scheduled from follow-on schedule check\r\n```\r\n\r\n****\n\n### Use case/motivation\n\nThere are times you have no need to see the timestamp nor the file source. The ability to hide them would let the logs take up less horizontal space and reduce the need to scroll horizontally. It would also allow you copy clean log lines without having to edit out the prefixes in a code editor. \n\n### Related issues\n\n_No response_\n\n### Are you willing to submit a PR?\n\n- [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n",

This may lead to situations where e.g. in PRs the CI is green, but new flaky tests get introduced, or existing tests get more flaky.\n\n## Goal\n\nTo avoid this we should increase visibility of flaky tests in PRs to make the author and reviewer more aware and ask them to check whether their PR contributes to the flakiness (and fix that if true). This could be done e.g. with in-place updated PRs comment(s) for flaky tests like demonstrated in https://github.com/camunda/camunda/pull/28834\n\nWe should aim to keep noise as low as possible.\n\n",

I can't argue with that u need to learn a lot u don't know how to write code yet this will be my last comment for the discussion", "**In short:**\n\n* **Use `async/await`** in production code ??? it's better for readability, maintainability, and handling complex asynchronous flows.\n* **Promises** are still the underlying mechanism, and sometimes useful directly (e.g., `Promise.all()`), but `async/await` is preferred for most use cases.\n\n### Why `async/await` is better:\n\n* Cleaner and more readable, especially for sequential logic.\n* Easier to write and debug than chained `.then()` calls.\n* Works well with `try/catch` for error handling.\n\n### When to use raw Promises:\n\n* When you need parallel execution (e.g., `Promise.all`, `Promise.race`).\n* In lower-level libraries or utility functions.\n\n??? **Recommendation for production**: Use `async/await` by default; use Promises directly only when it makes the code clearer or more efficient.\n\n\nI think i also said same but someone recommend me to revise my basics , Thankyou for your time and i am also busy in making personal project .", "@cipherravi  I know when i see a LLM using kid thats why I told u to read again ... find me a documentation that says \n```Use async/await in production code ??? it's better for readability, maintainability, and handling complex asynchronous flows.```\nwhat you are doing here is bending the context and saying that everytime u use the promise it will result in a complex unreadable code so use async await.\nRead the following docs and have a open mind towards programming approaches u will go a long way instead of using LLM to prove your point\n\npoint 1: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Async_JS/Promises#summary no where in this MDN doc they say u use async await instead of Promise\n\npoint 2: In the End of official MDN docs there is a article https://pouchdb.com/2015/05/18/we-have-a-problem-with-promises.html, In this article this guy explains how people like you don't understand the programming patterns and say that Promise are not good\n\nSo again @cipherravi  GO READ SOME DOCUMENTATIONS BEFORE ARGUING ON THE FORUMS IT WILL MAKE U LOOK LIKE A CHILD AND DO NOT USE LLM TO PROVE YOUR POINTS \n\nALSO FROM THE DOCS\n```Keep in mind that just like a promise chain, await forces asynchronous operations to be completed in series. This is necessary if the result of the next operation depends on the result of the last one, but if that's not the case then something like Promise.all() will be more performant.```", "@rogdevil \nFirst of all i can see in your eyes you are defeating here that is why you are using term like Kid for me you cannot prove it that promises are better for production if there is not need of promise.all or settle ... \n\nAnd LLM are built on dataset which you can't read even if you give your whole life so they are more accurate than you in theory.\n\nAnd the text book which you refer eloquent javascript , here are some lines from it \n\n```\nEven with promises, this kind of asynchronous code is annoying to write.\nPromises often need to be tied together in verbose, arbitrary-looking\nways. To create an asynchronous loop, Carla was forced to introduce a\nrecursive function.\n\nFor most asynchronous code, this notation is more convenient than\ndirectly using promises. You do still need an understanding of promises,\nsince in many cases you???ll still interact with them directly. But when\nwiring them together, async functions are generally more pleasant to\nwrite than chains of then calls.\n```\n## so by your one reference i gave you your answer and we were debating about readability and clean code\n\nAnd the doc you attach by saying i should see that is of year 2015 when async await is about to come and the author talks about benefits of Promises against callback not against async await but you lol miss the part . So childish at least do some research before telling anything \n\n## In the end i would say that accept that you were wrong about the fact that in terms of clean code , readability Async await is much better than Promises\n\n\n# All your sources were bullshit and Childish", "Well life will teach you nevermind .. there is a difference between word \"convenient\" and \"better\" and I will still say ...

This is using promises because it's an old implementation. Other new modules are written using async / await.\n\nIt's good to see some discussion regarding this subject, but yeah, we found out that promises chained can be a little messy as they become increasingly chained, and we are moving to async / await.\n\nBut you don't have to do this now. First, let's migrate only the top-level function to use native promises, and we can have this refactoring in another issue.", "> Just simple question why Async await came if everything was going good with Promises\n> \n> Give mature answer only\n\nit came coz people fell into the trap of long promise chains so it was hard for them to debug so JS guys introduced  async await  but the definition clean code is still subjective to who is coding  \nfor example - python is easier to learn and does a lot of abstraction for you to write simple code what will take u 8 lines of code in C u can do that with 1 line in python but when u need C u will use C not the python. You cannot say C is bad to use and one should only use Python it depends on the usecase ( I used this example because under the hood python uses C written libraries )\nmy first comment was in the same context I said none of them are superior \n```Using async await or promise are dependent on how you want the flow to be if u want blocking flow u use async await if u want parallel execution u can use promise```\nI never said that one is better than the other u need to see the situation to use one and if your only reason to hate Promise based approach is its difficult to understand then u need to brush up the basics, I use async await all the time but that does not make promise a bad choice\ndoes that clear it @cipherravi  ?\n", "I also said as python cannot do C work same when talking about parallel execution we should prefer Promises not all time we should use async await as much as possible . \n\nAnd i know my basics and when i face situation where Promise is necessary i will use that , i am not fan of any language or tool .

      "description" : "# \uD83D\uDCCC What is this about?\n\nBack In Time is a [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) (aka [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software)) backup tool. It finally needs a proper logo!\nThis is a follow-up to [Issue #215](https://github.com/bit-team/backintime/issues/215), where some ideas and early drafts were shared.\n\nWe???re looking for a designer who can help us create a strong application icon and possibly extending to tray icons and a banner image.\n\nWe know this is a big ask, so we want to be transparent about everything from the start.\n\n# \uD83C\uDFA8 What we're looking for\n- A main application icon. This is the first priority. Think of how it appears in the [About Dialog](https://translate.codeberg.org/media/screenshots/bit_aboutdlg_english.png).\n- The icon should also work as a tray icon in light and dark themes.\n  - Minimum supported size: 22??22 px\n- Bonus: a banner image (1500??500 px) for our [Mastodon presence](https://fosstodon.org/@backintime) would be lovely.\n- We would also like access to the source file (e.g. SVG), in addition to rendered formats (PNG, ICO, ...).\n- Creative freedom: We have a few ideas and sketches (see below), but we???re open to new, fresh concepts!\n- Inspiration and further resources:\n  - [Gnome Icon Guidelines](https://developer.gnome.org/hig/guidelines/app-icons.html)\n  - [AppIconPreview](https://flathub.org/apps/org.gnome.design.AppIconPreview) ??? useful tool for previewing icons\n  - [Blogpost: Designing a GNOME App Icon](https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/2019/12/30/designing-an-icon-for-your-app/)\n  - [SVG favicons + dark mode](https://css-tricks.com/svg-favicons-in-action/)\n  - Also consider this comment https://github.com/bit-team/backintime/issues/215#issuecomment-1646945614 .\n\n# ?????? Legal & Licensing\nWe know this is the boring part, but it???s important.\n\nIf you're familiar with licensing creative work, feel free to propose your own approach. If not, here???s what we suggest:\n- You remain the copyright holder.\n- The logo, including its source file, should be released under a license that???s compatible with GPL-2.0-or-later (the project???s license).\n- Preferred license: GPL-2.0-or-later, but we???re open to other free licenses that work well for artwork.\n- Important: We don???t own a trademark or plan to register one. That means it???s theoretically possible for others to re-use the logo under the license terms. But we???re not worried about that in practice.\n\nSome related discussions and resources:\n- [Open Source Design ??? Logo Licensing](https://discourse.opensourcedesign.net/t/how-to-licence-a-project-specific-software-logo)\n- [Debian Legal Discussion](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2024/08/msg00013.html)\n\nPlease don???t waste your resources and start creating the logo before we???ve agreed on licensing.\n\n# \uD83D\uDCA1 Sketches & Previous Ideas\nThese are just ideas. You???re free to ignore or remix them.\n\n## \uD83D\uDD18 Discs\n- A stack of 3 discs, representing storage space and backups.\n- An arrow wrapped around to symbolize backup or time.\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/acd97349-5d4f-4c51-b638-9f0862f3022e)\n\n## \uD83D\uDCC1 Hardlink Visualization\n- Three backup levels (discs), with vertical \"file\" columns.\n- Visualizes how files change across backups:\n  - Cuts = modified files\n  - Solid blocks = unchanged\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c0a7b6e-5a5a-4db1-850f-904710a72a73)\n\n## \uD83D\uDD24 \"BIT\" Abbreviation\n- Using the acronym B-I-T, with an arrow motif.\n- Concern: might be confused with Bitcoin.\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6085190-980f-4bdb-84f6-9c37aab0fa9f)\n\n## \uD83D\uDD04 The Arrow\n- An arrow circling the logo, symbolizing time or backup.\n- Can go counter-clockwise to emphasize the \"back\" in Back In Time.\n- Starts thin and gets thicker: suggests motion and time travel.\n\n## \uD83D\uDD17 Related Threads\n- [Issue #215: Old Logo Discussion](https://github.com/bit-team/backintime/issues/215)\n- [Forum post on Inkscape.org](https://inkscape.org/forums/cafe/open-source-project-back-in-time-looking-for-an-artist-creating-a-logo/)\n\n# \uD83E\uDD1D What We Offer\nWe can???t pay you, but:\n- You will be clearly credited in the project (e.g. README, website).\n- Your work will be seen and used by thousands of users.\n- You???ll help improve the visual identity of a long-standing FOSS project.\n\n# \uD83E\uDDF5 Want to contribute?\nComment here. If you have questions or suggestions, especially around licensing, let???s talk!\n\n# ?????? Feedback welcome!\nWe want this process to be transparent and respectful. If you???re a designer reading this and think we could improve how we???re approaching this: please tell us. We're open to honest feedback.",

      "description" : "### \uD83D\uDD0D Motivation\n\nCitation count provides a useful indicator of the academic impact of a publication. Automating the population of this field from Semantic Scholar saves manual effort and enhances bibliographic data quality in JabRef.\n\n### \uD83D\uDCCC Goal\n\nExtend the existing `SemanticScholarCitationFetcher` to retrieve the **citation count** for a given paper using the Semantic Scholar API and store it in a new BibTeX field `citationcount`.\n\n### \uD83D\uDEE0??? Tasks\n\n1. **Integrate citation count fetching**\n\n   * Implement logic in `org.jabref.logic.importer.fetcher.citation.semanticscholar.SemanticScholarCitationFetcher` using\n     `PaperDetails#getCitationCount()` from\n     `org.jabref.logic.importer.fetcher.citation.semanticscholar.PaperDetails`.\n\n2. **Add a new field**\n\n   * Define a new field `citationcount` in `org.jabref.model.entry.field.StandardField` (under JabRef-specific fields).\n   * Ensure that the field is recognized and included in citation fetcher updates.\n\n3. **Write tests**\n\n   * Add unit tests in\n     `org.jabref.logic.importer.fetcher.citation.semanticscholar.SemanticScholarCitationFetcherTest`\n     to verify that citation count is fetched and set correctly.\n   * Additonally, Mock or simulate Semantic Scholar API responses with citation counts.\n\n4. **UI integration**\n\n    * Add a new FieldEditor `CitationCount` (inspired by IdentifierEditor) and integrate it into the UI by modifying FieldEditors#getForField(...).\n    * Add an update button, which uses the SemanticScholarFEtcher to update the citation cound.\n\n### ??? Acceptance Criteria\n\n* When the fetcher is run on an entry with a DOI or title, and Semantic Scholar returns a citation count, the value is written to the `citationcount` field.\n* The value is stored as an integer.\n* Field appears in the entry editor in tab \"General\"\n\n\n### \uD83D\uDCDA Helpful resources\n\n* [[Semantic Scholar API](https://api.semanticscholar.org/)](https://api.semanticscholar.org/)\n* [`[PaperDetails](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/src/main/java/org/jabref/logic/importer/fetcher/citation/semanticscholar/PaperDetails.java)`](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/src/main/java/org/jabref/logic/importer/fetcher/citation/semanticscholar/PaperDetails.java)\n* [`[SemanticScholarCitationFetcher](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/src/main/java/org/jabref/logic/importer/fetcher/citation/semanticscholar/SemanticScholarCitationFetcher.java)`](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/src/main/java/org/jabref/logic/importer/fetcher/citation/semanticscholar/SemanticScholarCitationFetcher.java)\n* [[How to contribute to JabRef](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n* [[Developer Docs](https://devdocs.jabref.org/)](https://devdocs.jabref.org/)\n\n",

I noticed on the class that you share that when the request is sent in the `getApiUrl` , you pass a citation count in de query param and papares are return here `citationDataItem.getCitingPaper() ` are you expecting like a sum of all citation count or like a list of counts?  and that filed will be included  here `StandardField ` and that will be the response of the fetcher? something like `org.jabref.model.entry.field.StandardField.CitationCount getCitationCount`?", "@SalvadorRomo I have no clue yet \uD83D\uDE05", "General hints on Fetchers: https://devdocs.jabref.org/code-howtos/fetchers.html", "well, I think I can work for the next weeks, please assign it to me.

Instead of passing `stream=True` as a parameter, xAI uses a `.stream()` method on the chat object that returns tuples of `(response, chunk)`.\n\nExample from xAI docs:\n```python\nfor response, chunk in chat.stream():\n    print(chunk.content, end=\"\", flush=True)\n```\n\n## What needs to be done\n\n1. Implement streaming support in `instructor/client_xai.py` for both sync and async clients\n2. Handle the conversion from xAI's streaming format to the format expected by instructor's streaming infrastructure\n3. Add comprehensive tests in `tests/llm/test_xai/test_stream.py` covering:\n   - `create_iterable` for multiple object extraction\n   - `create_partial` for partial object streaming\n   - Both JSON and TOOLS modes\n   - Both sync and async operations\n\n## Technical considerations\n\n- The implementation needs to yield response chunks in a format compatible with instructor's `process_response` function\n- For JSON mode: chunks should be extracted from the content\n- For TOOLS mode: chunks need to be extracted from tool calls\n- The streaming generator should yield chunks as they arrive, not accumulate all content first\n\n## References\n\n- [xAI Streaming Documentation](https://docs.x.ai/api/streaming-response)\n- Current xAI implementation: `instructor/client_xai.py`\n- Example streaming implementations: See OpenAI or Anthropic providers\n\nThis would be a great first contribution for someone familiar with async generators and streaming APIs\\!",

      "url" : "https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/36978",
      "repositoryName" : "huggingface/transformers",
      "description" : "## Community contributions: Add Fast Image Processors\n\nFast image processors have been rolling out progressively for a while. Now that the [BaseImageProcessorFast](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/image_processing_utils_fast.py#L292), from which all fast image processors inherit, is in a more stable state, I'm opening this issue to encourage contributors to add fast image processors for models that still only have a \"slow\" image processor.\n\n### How to implement a Fast Image Processor\n\nThe core principle of fast image processors is to use `torch` and `torchvision` functions for image transformations instead of `PIL` or `numpy`. Among other performance benefits, this enables processing images on GPU, significantly improving inference speed.\n\nAnother key difference compared to slow image processors is that, unlike `BaseImageProcessor`, which provides only a minimal skeleton, `BaseImageProcessorFast` includes all the fundamental functionalities needed for a basic image processor. This allows optimizations made in BaseImageProcessorFast to propagate to its inherited classes. Additionally, most repetitive logic for image loading and argument handling is managed within BaseImageProcessorFast. Except in rare cases, inherited classes do not need to handle image loading, conversion, or retrieving arguments from class attributes in the call/preprocess function, this is all handled in `BaseImageProcessorFast`.\n\n#### Getting Started\n\nRun the following command:\n```bash\ntransformers-cli add-fast-image-processor --model-name model_name\n```\nwhere `model_name` is the name of the model (as found in its folder under `transformers/src/transformers/models`) for which you're adding the fast image processor.\n\nThis command will handle all necessary imports and generate a basic fast image processor, which will look similar to this example for Beit:\n\n```python\n# coding=utf-8\n# Copyright 2025 The HuggingFace Inc. team.

The class attributes, such as `resample` and `image_mean`, are automatically parsed from the slow image processor when running the script above. However, you should verify their correctness and check for any missing or incorrectly assigned values.\n\n### Customizing the Image Processor\n\nIf the image processor requires additional functionalities beyond the basic augmentations, you will need to override the `_preprocess` function in `BaseImageProcessorFast`. Check the `_preprocess` implementation in `BaseImageProcessorFast` for reference. Notably, it leverages `group_images_by_shape` and `reorder_images` to enable batch processing, significantly increasing processing speed, particularly on GPUs. If you create new image processing functions, ensure they support batch processing by utilizing `group_images_by_shape` and `reorder_images` where possible.\n\nIf your image processor requires additional kwargs not present in [`DefaultFastImageProcessorKwargs`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/image_processing_utils_fast.py#L172), you must create a `ModelNameFastImageProcessorKwargs` class that inherits from `DefaultFastImageProcessorKwargs` and defines the new kwargs. Additionally, you should document the added kwargs in the class and the `preprocess` function using `add_start_docstrings`. (This documentation process may be simplified soon, but is necessary for now to get a correct documentation).\n\nFor an example of handling custom kwargs and documentation, refer to [LlavaNextImageProcessorFast](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/models/llava_next/image_processing_llava_next_fast.py).\n\n### Important Notes\n\n- In nearly all cases, `_preprocess` is the only function in `BaseImageProcessorFast` that needs to be overridden.\n- The `_preprocess` function does not require default values for its arguments, as they are automatically derived from class attributes if not explicitly provided.\n- Even if `PIL` images or `numpy` arrays are passed to the image processor, the `images` argument in `_preprocess` will always be a list of tensors, with the channel dimension first.\n\n### Handling Edge Cases\n\n- **Nested Images:** If images are provided as nested lists (e.g., `[[image1, image2], [image3]]`), they will be flattened to `[image1, image2, image3]` by default before being passed to `_preprocess`. This behavior can be modified by overriding `_prepare_images_structure`, though flattening is generally recommended.\n- **Formatting Custom  Kwargs:** If any custom kwargs require formatting before `_preprocess`, override `_further_process_kwargs`.\n- **Validating Custom Kwargs:** If additional validation is needed for custom kwargs or existing ones, override `_validate_preprocess_kwargs`.\n\n### Testing\n\nIn the case where the model already has a `test_image_processing_model_name.py` file under `transformers/tests/models/model_name`, the script ran before should have imported the fast image processor to the file, and added it as a `fast_image_processing_class` class attribute to the `ModelNameImageProcessingTest` class.\nHowever this is not enough to get all the tests to run on the fast image processor. For all the test functions under `ModelNameImageProcessingTest`, you need to replace `image_processing = self.image_processing_class(**self.image_processor_dict)` with a loop over `self.image_processor_list`.\n\nFor example, the `test_image_processor_properties` test in `test_image_processing_beit.py` which looks like this:\n\n```python\n    def test_image_processor_properties(self):\n        image_processing = self.image_processing_class(**self.image_processor_dict)\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"do_resize\"))\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"size\"))\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"do_center_crop\"))\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"center_crop\"))\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"do_normalize\"))\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"image_mean\"))\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"image_std\"))\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"do_reduce_labels\"))\n```\nshould be changed to this:\n\n```python\n    def test_image_processor_properties(self):\n        for image_processing_class in self.image_processor_list:\n            image_processing = image_processing_class(**self.image_processor_dict)\n            self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"do_resize\"))\n            self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"size\"))\n            self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"do_center_crop\"))\n            self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"center_crop\"))\n            self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"do_normalize\"))\n            self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"image_mean\"))\n            self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"image_std\"))\n            self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"do_reduce_labels\"))\n```\n\nIn the case where no image processing test file is present, now is a great time to add one! You can have a look at the[ CLIP image processing test file](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/ad5d40de9c4d4899d5b79243f63e22c72e8b3669/tests/models/clip/test_image_processing_clip.py) to use as a simple starting point.\n\nDon't hesitate to add model-specific tests if you feel like there are some non-standard image processing techniques in the processor :).\n\nTo run the tests, use this command:\n```bash\nRUN_SLOW=1 python -m pytest tests/models/model_name/test_image_processing_model_name.py\n```\n\n\n### Choosing an Image Processor to Implement\n\nThe difficulty of implementing a fast image processor varies by model.

Good task for this week..!", "@edgarriba I love kornia! But for image processors at inference time, it might be a bit overkill since 90% of the time, we only need a mix of resizing, normalizing, padding, and cropping, combined with some model-specific logic. I???ve found that `torch`/`torchvision` functional transforms usually cover these needs well, and pipelines like kornia `ImageSequential` or torchvision `Compose` aren???t always a good fit because some models require additional processing steps or custom logic in between. We also wanted to avoid adding an extra dependency to Transformers for fast image processors.\n\nThat said, I do think kornia could be valuable down the line, especially for batch processing. I'm still exploring how to optimize batch processing performance on both GPU and CPU, and kornia likely handles this more efficiently than our current approach.", "The core of the library is pure functional -- that has been always the scope.

      "comments" : [ "Hi @puzpuzpuz  / QuestDB Team,\r\n\r\nWith the plans to fix this issue, I did some troubleshooting and reproducing attempts. Below were the observations.\r\n\r\n**Observations** \r\n\r\n- This issue can be seen for tables with symbol cast easily (when row count is huge)\r\n\r\n- This issue can be reproduced for tables without symbol cast as well (but We cannot reproduce all the times).\r\n\r\n- If the row count is less, this issue cannot be reproduced (above ~100,000) \r\n\r\n- If We create a table and waits for some mins (before querying the data) to query the data, We can see the results \r\n\r\n**Analysis and Debugging** \r\n\r\nAs per my understanding of this issue,\r\n\r\nThe problem starts at https://github.com/questdb/questdb/blob/master/core/src/main/java/io/questdb/cairo/TxReader.java#L437\r\n\r\n`partitionSegmentSize` always becomes  zero when we see empty results. \r\n\r\nAs QuestDB uses the memory mapping technique, it seems that _txn file was mapped to the address of _txn file correctly. But When it read the data, they were not correct(eg: `partitionSegmentSize`).\r\n\r\n\r\n**Thread dumps**\r\n\r\nI created a table at ~21:24 and _txn file was lastly modified at **21:24**\r\n\r\n```\r\ncreate table abc30 as (\r\n select x::symbol s,\r\n        timestamp_sequence('2023-11-17T10', 1000000L) ts\r\n from long_sequence(1000000)\r\n) timestamp(ts) partition by day;\r\n```\r\n\r\nI didn???t query the data immediately after table creation instead I took thread dumps at different times. I noticed that the **_wal-apply_0** thread was in  runnable state_.\r\n\r\nWal-apply_0 ???s stack traces and observations \r\n\r\n| Time         |  State |  Stack trace |\r\n|-----------|-------------|-------|\r\n|21:24:43   | Runnable      | at io.questdb.cairo.SymbolMapWriter.lookupPutAndCache(io.questdb@7.3.6-SNAPSHOT/SymbolMapWriter.java:292)<br>at io.questdb.cairo.SymbolMapWriter.put(io.questdb@7.3.6-SNAPSHOT/SymbolMapWriter.java:217)<br>at io.questdb.cairo.SymbolMapWriter.put(io.questdb@7.3.6-SNAPSHOT/SymbolMapWriter.java:203)<br>at io.questdb.cairo.TableWriter.createWalSymbolMapping(io.questdb@7.3.6-SNAPSHOT/TableWriter.java:3529)|\r\n|21:24:56   | Runnable      | at io.questdb.std.Chars.equals(io.questdb@7.3.6-SNAPSHOT/Chars.java:215)<br>at io.questdb.cairo.SymbolMapWriter.lookupAndPut(io.questdb@7.3.6-SNAPSHOT/SymbolMapWriter.java:284)<br>at io.questdb.cairo.SymbolMapWriter.lookupPutAndCache(io.questdb@7.3.6-SNAPSHOT/SymbolMapWriter.java:292)<br>at io.questdb.cairo.SymbolMapWriter.put(io.questdb@7.3.6-SNAPSHOT/SymbolMapWriter.java:217)<br>at io.questdb.cairo.SymbolMapWriter.put(io.questdb@7.3.6-SNAPSHOT/SymbolMapWriter.java:203)<br>at io.questdb.cairo.TableWriter.createWalSymbolMapping(io.questdb@7.3.6-SNAPSHOT/TableWriter.java:3529)  |\r\n|21:27:52   | Runnable      | at io.questdb.std.Chars.equals(io.questdb@7.3.6-SNAPSHOT/Chars.java:215)<br>at io.questdb.cairo.SymbolMapWriter.lookupAndPut(io.questdb@7.3.6-SNAPSHOT/SymbolMapWriter.java:284)<br>at io.questdb.cairo.SymbolMapWriter.lookupPutAndCache(io.questdb@7.3.6-SNAPSHOT/SymbolMapWriter.java:292)<br>at io.questdb.cairo.SymbolMapWriter.put(io.questdb@7.3.6-SNAPSHOT/SymbolMapWriter.java:217)<br>at io.questdb.cairo.SymbolMapWriter.put(io.questdb@7.3.6-SNAPSHOT/SymbolMapWriter.java:203)<br>at io.questdb.cairo.TableWriter.createWalSymbolMapping(io.questdb@7.3.6-SNAPSHOT/TableWriter.java:3529)           |\r\n|21:29:03  | Runnable  | at io.questdb.std.Chars.equalsChars(io.questdb@7.3.6-SNAPSHOT/Chars.java:1130)<br>at io.questdb.std.Chars.equals(io.questdb@7.3.6-SNAPSHOT/Chars.java:219)<br>at io.questdb.cairo.SymbolMapWriter.lookupAndPut(io.questdb@7.3.6-SNAPSHOT/SymbolMapWriter.java:284)<br>at io.questdb.cairo.SymbolMapWriter.lookupPutAndCache(io.questdb@7.3.6-SNAPSHOT/SymbolMapWriter.java:292)<br>at io.questdb.cairo.SymbolMapWriter.put(io.questdb@7.3.6-SNAPSHOT/SymbolMapWriter.java:217)<br>at io.questdb.cairo.SymbolMapWriter.put(io.questdb@7.3.6-SNAPSHOT/SymbolMapWriter.java:203)<br>at io.questdb.cairo.TableWriter.createWalSymbolMapping(io.questdb@7.3.6-SNAPSHOT/TableWriter.java:3529)  |\r\n|21:30:21   | Runnable  | at io.questdb.std.Chars.equals(io.questdb@7.3.6-SNAPSHOT/Chars.java:215)<br>at io.questdb.cairo.SymbolMapWriter.lookupAndPut(io.questdb@7.3.6-SNAPSHOT/SymbolMapWriter.java:284)<br>at io.questdb.cairo.SymbolMapWriter.lookupPutAndCache(io.questdb@7.3.6-SNAPSHOT/SymbolMapWriter.java:292)<br>at io.questdb.cairo.SymbolMapWriter.put(io.questdb@7.3.6-SNAPSHOT/SymbolMapWriter.java:217)<br>at io.questdb.cairo.SymbolMapWriter.put(io.questdb@7.3.6-SNAPSHOT/SymbolMapWriter.java:203)<br>at io.questdb.cairo.TableWriter.createWalSymbolMapping(io.questdb@7.3.6-SNAPSHOT/TableWriter.java:3529)  |\r\n|21:32:49  | Timed Waiting  |  \tat java.lang.Thread.sleep(java.base@11.0.21/Native Method)<br>at io.questdb.std.Os.sleep(io.questdb@7.3.6-SNAPSHOT/Os.java:171)<br>at io.questdb.mp.Worker.run(io.questdb@7.3.6-SNAPSHOT/Worker.java:176) |\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAfter 21:32:49, I queried the table and got non-empty results.  As per the above observation, it seems that We get empty results unless we wait QuestDB to write all the data to disk.  However, this observation doesn't explain why `TxReader` cannot read `_txn` file(mapped space).  I'll continue my analysis.

I know it's hard to come up with good rules on what constitutes a heavy operation worth wrapping in an `if` and what doesn't.\nBut I still think the logic could be tuned a bit better with some heuristics.\n\nE.g. this is an excessive change:\n```diff\n-  project.getLogger().info(\"Creating??build??directory:??{}\",??buildDir.getAbsolutePath());\n+  if??(project.getLogger().isInfoEnabled())??{\n+     project.getLogger().info(\"Creating??build??directory:??{}\",??buildDir.getAbsolutePath());\n+  }\n```\nAnd there's plenty of similar ones.\n\n## Describe the solution you'd like\n\nMaybe skip wrapping if all method calls in the expression are getters?\n(which I know they could be expensive operations, but in most of the cases they are not)\n",

This would enable users to quickly remove unwanted or outdated workloads from the view\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Navigate to **Deployed Workloads**.\n2. View the nodes in the **Tree View** layout.\n3. Attempt to find the **Delete** option for any node.\n4. Observe that the **Delete** button is missing.\n\n### Additional Context/Logs\n\n```shell\n\n```",

For example, a user with the zh_CN locale would expect the Chinese date format, not a globally set server format. So it???s probably better to detect the user???s locale from their device or IP.  I'll have to check how others handled this when locale is changed...\n\nWe already have this functionality in dev mode for the user panel, which converts date/time based on the browser locale:\n<img width=\"384\" height=\"104\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51eae2f5-948c-4632-956b-d8303dc57924\" />\n\nIt's not perfect: for me, it shows Chrome's default *en_US* format even though I'm in Europe.\n\nBut it???s certainly better than the existing format, we can definitely reuse it.\n\nWe simply need to add these CSS classes:\n\n* `.time_ago` ??? displays relative time like `X seconds/minutes/days ago`\n* `.time_readable` ??? displays the timestamp formatted according to the user???s browser locale, e.g., `04/28/2025, 04:00:01 PM` or `28.04.2025, 16:00:01`\n\nexample:\n\n```\n<p class=\"text-xs text-gray-500 time_ago\" x-text=\"date\">{{date}}</p>\n```\n\nneeds to be edited to:\n\n```\n<p class=\"text-xs text-gray-500 time_ago\" x-text=\"date\">{{date}}</p>\n```\n\nso in browser it transforms to:\n```\n<p class=\"text-xs text-gray-500 time_ago\" x-text=\"date\" title=\"04/28/2025, 04:00:01 PM\">70 days ago</p>\n```\n\n@GHANGHASASHWANI, if you can, please navigate through the user and admin interfaces and update every instance of timestamps to use these classes accordingly, im happy to assist with finding the appropriate templates, just share the page link.", "@stefanpejcic \nValid points! \nBut I think IP shouldn't be considered, as I could be using a VPN and that would mess up my dates. Or if I'm an American on the EU, the dates on my panel would be messed up according to where I am so it is not good for UX.\n\nBrowser locale seems better, although the perfect solution for user flexibility would be to have the possibility of having it both as a global server setting + user setting.\n\nI can set my global server to always display date in `DD/MM/YYYY H:i:s` but for a specific user, he can set his account to `YYYY-MM-DD h:i:s A`\n\nFor now I feel like yes, adding those classes as of right now will already be an upgrade, since the date is barely readable by the common user, but we could think of this in the future.\n\nIt should be something like Localization Options, where besides choosing language, we could chose the format wanted for this fields display.\n\nWhat do you think? If you think this would be a good feature just add it to the roadmap or for the future, as I believe this would require some time to be implemented, and for sure it's not High Priority.\n\n_Also I believe you have a typo on your previous comment, because all the lines are using `time_ago` and I believe it should be `time_readable`._" ],

      "description" : "It has come to my attention that many people want the badguy counter added back\n\nThere is a conflict of interest between level designers at the moment:\n\n- Some level designers have said that they don't appreciate the badguy statistic feature\n- Some level designers do appreciate the badguy statistic feature\n\nRecently, a change has occured where the badguy statistic is removed by default. This is **not** a compromise. It is a removal of an entire feature.\n\n- Admittedly, some people want to use enemies without needing to necessarily kill them in order to hit 100% goal. Example: the high, out of reach owls in \"In Flanders Ice Field\". This is understandable.\n- Yet, sometimes, it's not difficult to accommodate it. Example: placing ladders or ways to get on the roof to hit owls with fire bullets, or etc in \"In Flanders Ice Field\".\n- However, there are still some edge cases where inaccessible badguys might be warranted. And it should be appreciated that some level designers might not want to use certain elements to give access to certain enemies.\n- Regardless - Badguys should still aim to not be in out-of-reach areas (physically trapped, i.e., a cave level where theres a hole with fish in it), as players might attempt to kill them, and spend time trying to figure out how, only to waste time. **They might think there are secret paths to an additional region of gameplay because of the presence of badguys, when there is not.**\n- There are some levels which are air flower only, and contain spiky enemies only killable via snails. But it is not as fun to carry around snails everywhere for each badguy, back and fourth. This is understandable.\n\nTherefore there has to be a compromise, not a complete deletion of an entire feature.\n\nA perfect solution would be:\n\n- add badguy statistic ON by default\n- EITHER: let players set a specific badguy to be slightly transparent/look different, to let the player know it doesnt count to statistics (This could also integrate well with dispenser enemies, which do not count to the statistic)\n- OR: let players set the badguy limit manually, so that some out of reach badguys can be accounted for, should it not be reasonable for them to be killed. (And find some other solution for the dispenser badguys ... probably a separate issue)\n\nThe latter example should aim to be for edge cases and not poor design choices. That way some designers who don't appreciate the mechanic can chose their playstyle(s) appropriately to focus less on this mechanic.\n\nIMO badguy statistic feature still has a place in the game, and there are interesting design practices you can encorporate as a level designer, to make some more unique scenarios where the badguy statistic needs to be reached. Unique and inventive Enemy utilisation is a declining principle as of recent, and deserves to be revived, as it encourages a different yet valued playstyle, which can provide more intruige and depth to a level should a designer want to do so. It was a feature before. It should still exist in some capacity today.\n</div>",

It clearly states that EOS and image deprecation date for tis image is May 2025. \n\nI suspect the error can be easily fixed by updating [this line](https://github.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-apps/blob/55d09c01704909e1142fd14e2a91d5525872efd0/server_manager/www/gcp_account.ts#L275), but I'm not sure what image is to be used (otherwise I could try to open a PR). \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. open Outline Manager\n2. connect to GCP account\n3. create a project using \"ADD SERVER\" tab\n4. create server using on of the locations (same behaviour is observed for multiple server locations)\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\nSuccessfully completed addition of new server as it was before.\n\n### What actually happened?\n\nI've tried to create a new GCP server using the respective option in \"ADD SERVER\" tab. \n\n### Outline Version\n\n1.17.2\n\n### What operation system are you using?\n\nmacOS\n\n### Operating System Version\n\nSonoma 14.6.1\n\n### Screenshots and Videos\n\n_No response_",

\n\n Explicitly imported certain dependencies to support the  `sm.GLF ` approach. \n\n### Impact - \n\nImproved the addressing capabilities for type checking, patsy error and categoricalDtype issue \n\n### Change - \n\n Instead of using formula based interface (`f\"{variable} ~ 1\" or f\"{variable} ~ {' + '.join(parents)}`) relying on patsy, I replaced it with sm.GLM for constructing the design matrix mannually\n\n### Impact - \n\n Eliminates PatsyError caused by patsy failing to parse numeric or ambiguous column names (e.g., \"0\", \"1\").\n\n### Change - \n\n Added comprehensive validation for `self.data`, `variable` and `parents`.\n\n### Impact - \n\n Prevents typeError and categorical errors fixing runtime failures \n\n### Overall impact - \n \n **New test file for validating overall impact ** - \n\n```\n\n`import unittest\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom pgmpy.estimators import LogLikelihoodGauss\nfrom pgmpy.models import DiscreteBayesianNetwork\n\nclass TestLogLikelihoodGaussFix(unittest.TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        # Create a small Gaussian dataset with alphanumeric column names\n        self.data_alpha = pd.DataFrame({\n            \"A\": np.random.randn(100),\n            \"B\": np.random.randn(100),\n            \"C\": np.random.randn(100)\n        })\n        # Create a dataset with numeric column names (to test PatsyError fix)\n        self.data_numeric = pd.DataFrame({\n            \"0\": np.random.randn(100),\n            \"1\": np.random.randn(100),\n            \"2\": np.random.randn(100)\n        })\n        # Create a dataset with non-numeric data for error testing\n        self.data_invalid = pd.DataFrame({\n            \"A\": [\"x\", \"y\", \"z\"],\n            \"B\": np.random.randn(3),\n            \"C\": np.random.randn(3)\n        })\n        # Create a dataset with NaNs for error testing\n        self.data_nans = pd.DataFrame({\n            \"A\": np.random.randn(100),\n            \"B\": np.random.randn(100),\n            \"C\": np.array([np.nan] + [np.random.randn() for _ in range(99)])\n        })\n        self.model_alpha = DiscreteBayesianNetwork([(\"A\", \"C\"), (\"B\", \"C\")])\n        self.model_numeric = DiscreteBayesianNetwork([(\"0\", \"2\"), (\"1\", \"2\")])\n\n    def test_local_score_alphanumeric(self):\n        \"\"\"Test local_score with alphanumeric column names.\"\"\"\n        scorer = LogLikelihoodGauss(self.data_alpha)\n        ll_a = scorer.local_score(\"A\", parents=[])\n        self.assertIsInstance(ll_a, float, \"Log-likelihood should be a float\")\n        self.assertFalse(np.isnan(ll_a), \"Log-likelihood should not be NaN\")\n        ll_c = scorer.local_score(\"C\", parents=[\"A\", \"B\"])\n        self.assertIsInstance(ll_c, float, \"Log-likelihood should be a float\")\n        self.assertFalse(np.isnan(ll_c), \"Log-likelihood should not be NaN\")\n\n    def test_local_score_numeric(self):\n        \"\"\"Test local_score with numeric column names (fixes PatsyError).\"\"\"\n        scorer = LogLikelihoodGauss(self.data_numeric)\n        \n        ll_0 = scorer.local_score(\"0\", parents=[])\n        self.assertIsInstance(ll_0, float, \"Log-likelihood should be a float\")\n        self.assertFalse(np.isnan(ll_0), \"Log-likelihood should not be NaN\")\n                ll_2 = scorer.local_score(\"2\", parents=[\"0\", \"1\"])\n        self.assertIsInstance(ll_2, float, \"Log-likelihood should be a float\")\n        self.assertFalse(np.isnan(ll_2), \"Log-likelihood should not be NaN\")\n\n    def test_score_model(self):\n        \"\"\"Test score method with both alphanumeric and numeric column names.\"\"\"\n        \n        scorer_alpha = LogLikelihoodGauss(self.data_alpha)\n        score_alpha = scorer_alpha.score(self.model_alpha)\n        self.assertIsInstance(score_alpha, float, \"Model score should be a float\")\n        self.assertFalse(np.isnan(score_alpha), \"Model score should not be NaN\")\n        \n        scorer_numeric = LogLikelihoodGauss(self.data_numeric)\n        score_numeric = scorer_numeric.score(self.model_numeric)\n        self.assertIsInstance(score_numeric, float, \"Model score should be a float\")\n        self.assertFalse(np.isnan(score_numeric), \"Model score should not be NaN\")\n\n    def test_invalid_dtype(self):\n        \"\"\"Test error handling for non-numeric data.\"\"\"\n        scorer = LogLikelihoodGauss(self.data_invalid)\n        with self.assertRaises(ValueError, msg=\"Should raise ValueError for non-numeric variable\"):\n            scorer.local_score(\"A\", parents=[\"B\"])\n\n    def test_missing_values(self):\n        \"\"\"Test error handling for NaN values.\"\"\"\n        scorer = LogLikelihoodGauss(self.data_nans)\n        with self.assertRaises(ValueError, msg=\"Should raise ValueError for missing values\"):\n            scorer.local_score(\"C\", parents=[\"A\", \"B\"])\n\n    def tearDown(self):\n        \"\"\"Clean up test data.\"\"\"\n        del self.data_alpha\n        del self.data_numeric\n        del self.data_invalid\n        del self.data_nans\n        del self.model_alpha\n        del self.model_numeric`\n\n\n```\n  ### Results of the 5 tests  -

Information Processing Letters. 110 (8???9): 279???281. doi:10.1016/j.ipl.2010.02.001.\n\nIt says that:\nWe have shown that during the execution of the Floyd???\nWarshall algorithm exponentially large numbers may occur, if the input graph contains negative cycles. Theorem 2\nimplies that even for graphs with less than 30 vertices and\n60 edges with weight ???1 it may happen that during the\nexecution of the Floyd???Warshall algorithm numbers with\nabsolute value larger than 2^64 occur. This shows that for\nlarger graphs it can be quite likely to have subgraphs causing an overflow.\nOf course, there is a simple way to avoid this pitfall:\nInstead of checking for negative cycles at the end of the\nalgorithm one can include lines 8 and 9 in Fig. 1 in the forloop in line 6 without increasing the worst-case runtime.\nAnother possibility is to first use the Bellman???Ford algorithm [8] to detect negative cycles in O(mn) and to start\nthe Floyd???Warshall algorithm only if the input graph has\nno negative cycles. Most implementations of the Floyd???\nWarshall algorithm we have seen apply neither of these\ntwo solutions and therefore might fail if negative cycles\nexist in the input graph. With this note we want to make\naware of this potential pitfall.\n\nSo, do we need to add some lines in the usual Floyd algorithm to prevent overflow from happening? I'm not sure on how to construct a counter-example, sorry.",

      "description" : "## What problem are you trying to solve?\r\n\r\n> \r\n> From : https://www.bouncycastle.org/latest_releases.html\r\n> \r\n> With the arrival of Java 15. jdk15 is not quite as unambiguous as it was. The jdk18on jars are compiled to work with anything from Java 1.8 up. They are also multi-release jars so do support some features that were introduced in Java 9, Java 11, and Java 15. If you have issues with multi-release jars see the jdk15to18 release jars below.\r\n> \r\n> Also\r\n> \r\n> BC 1.71 changed the jdk15on jars to jdk18on so the base has now moved to Java 8. For earlier JVMs, or containers/applications that cannot cope with multi-release jars, you should now use the jdk15to18 jars.\r\n\r\n> Further Note (users of Oracle JVM 1.7 or earlier, users of \"pre-Java 9\" toolkits): As of 1.63 we have started including signed jars for \"jdk15to18\", if you run into issues with either signature validation in the JCE or the presence of the multi-release versions directory in the regular \"jdk18on\" jar files try the \"jdk15to18\" jars instead. Please also note the JCE certificate in the public access versions of Oracle Java 6 (6u45) and Oracle Java 7 (7u80) is expired on the 20th April 2021. We still counter sign the jdk15to18 jars with this certificate for compatibility reasons, but Oracle does distribute JVMs for Java 6 and Java 7 with a newer, and stronger, certificate to holders of Java Support Contracts.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What precondition(s) should be checked before applying this recipe?\r\n\r\n- groupId `org.bouncycastle`  \r\n- artifactId `*-jdk15on`\r\n- Project is using Java 8 and up\r\n\r\n\r\n## Describe the situation before applying the recipe\r\n```xml\r\n\r\n             <dependency>\r\n            <groupId>org.bouncycastle</groupId>\r\n            <artifactId>bcprov-jdk15on</artifactId>\r\n           <version>1.70</version>\r\n        </dependency>\r\n        <dependency>\r\n            <groupId>org.bouncycastle</groupId>\r\n            <artifactId>bcpkix-jdk15on</artifactId>\r\n           <version>1.70</version>\r\n        </dependency>\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Describe the situation after applying the recipe\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n\r\ndiff --git a/pom.xml\r\nindex 1579251e4..2519c4a40 100644\r\n--- a/b/pom.xml\r\n+++ b/c/pom.xml\r\n@@ -215,12 +215,12 @@\r\n         <dependency>\r\n             <groupId>org.bouncycastle</groupId>\r\n-            <artifactId>bcprov-jdk15on</artifactId>\r\n+            <artifactId>bcprov-jdk18on</artifactId>\r\n-          <version>1.70</version>\r\n+          <version>1.76</version>\r\n         </dependency>\r\n         <dependency>\r\n             <groupId>org.bouncycastle</groupId>\r\n-            <artifactId>bcpkix-jdk15on</artifactId>\r\n+            <artifactId>bcpkix-jdk18on</artifactId>\r\n-          <version>1.70</version>\r\n+          <version>1.76</version>\r\n         </dependency>\r\n         <dependency>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Additional context \r\n\r\n\r\nUsing the `*jdk15on` packages puts projects at risk as this package is no longer updated with these coordinates (ie : tools like dependabot can't help here) \r\n\r\nSee  : \r\n\r\nhttps://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-33201\r\nhttps://github.com/github/advisory-database/commits/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/07/GHSA-hr8g-6v94-x4m9/GHSA-hr8g-6v94-x4m9.json\r\nhttps://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hr8g-6v94-x4m9",

That should help when you run the recipe periodically as well, instead of as a one-off migration." ],

      "description" : "### Is there an existing issue already for this feature request/idea?\n\n- [x] I have searched for an existing issue, and could not find anything. I believe this is a new feature request to be evaluated.\n\n### What problem is this feature going to solve? Why should it be added?\n\nRight now, the `Database` CRD only manages the `owner` of the schema.\n\nPostgreSQL provides two privileges as part of the `GRANT` command on schemas: `CREATE` and `GRANT`. See [\"SQL Grant\"](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-grant.html).\n\nUsers are now using the post initialization scripts for this, making it imperative, one-off and thus fragile.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nProviding usage permissions on managed schema objects as part of the `Database` CRD.\n\nThe `GRANT` SQL command in Postgres has the following syntax:\n\n```sql\nGRANT { { CREATE | USAGE } [, ...] | ALL [ PRIVILEGES ] }\n    ON SCHEMA schema_name [, ...]\n    TO role_specification [, ...] [ WITH GRANT OPTION ]\n    [ GRANTED BY role_specification ]\n```\n\nBoth `GRANTED BY` and `WITH GRANT OPTION` are not suitable for a declarative environment typical of CloudNativePG, so we will focus only on `CREATE` and `USAGE`.\n\nA possible implementation could be:\n\n```yaml\n# ...\nspec:\n  schemas:\n  - name: app\n    owner: app\n    create:\n    - name: angus\n      type: grant\n    - name: brian\n      type: revoke\n    usage:\n    - name: angus\n      type: grant\n    - name: brian\n      type: grant\n# ...\n```\n\nThe default `type` is `grant`.\n\nFor example, the above will check that `angus` hasn't got yet the `create` privilege for the `app` database and run the required `GRANT CREATE ON app TO angus`. Similarly, if `brian` has `create` usage on the same `app` schema, it will run `REVOKE CREATE ON app FROM angus`.\n\nSee: [`REVOKE`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-revoke.html).\n\nPlease feel free to change the above proposal if you have a better idea.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nWe could do nothing, and delegate this operation to another tool.\n\nHowever, I personally think that this is a good responsibility for the `schema` management feature in the `Database` CRD.\n\n### Additional context\n\nN/A\n\n### Backport?\n\nNo\n\n### Are you willing to actively contribute to this feature?\n\nYes\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct",

This class is responsible for executing requests at the transport layer (usually HTTP).\r\n- `NClient.Resilience.Attempt.*` events should be added in the same class, but in an other [method](https://github.com/nclient/NClient/blob/9debf7d46b5d434195bc79f09d965eb61116a5de/src/NClient/NClient.Standalone/Client/TransportNClient.cs#L263).\r\n- `NClient.Exceptions.*` events should be added in `ClientInterceptor` class. All client requests begin and end with this class, so all exceptions are intercepted [there](https://github.com/nclient/NClient/blob/9debf7d46b5d434195bc79f09d965eb61116a5de/src/NClient/NClient.Standalone/ClientProxy/Generation/Interceptors/ClientInterceptor.cs#L136).\r\n\r\nThus, it is enough to focus on just two classes: `ClientInterceptor` and `TransportNClient`.

The operator is designed to accept a `parameters` argument,\nbut it seems that this argument is [not being utilized](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/providers/neo4j/src/airflow/providers/neo4j/operators/neo4j.py#L65) when [executing the query](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/providers/neo4j/src/airflow/providers/neo4j/hooks/neo4j.py#L113).

For example by serializing the object on one end - feeding it to JRPC and then deserializing it at the other end.\r\n\r\nMy use case for moving a lot of data is very real, it's not farfetched at all and I believe it's pretty common.

What I currently do is use `TextEncoder/TextDecoder` to serialize the data as a single char-per-byte string (using windows-1252 encoding) and deserialize it in Node on the other side which is fast (since passing strings is much faster). \r\n\r\nPuppeteer can implement a similar serialize/deserialize strategy which would make passing typed arrays much faster.

It will be available at window.buffer.Buffer.\r\nawait this.page!.addScriptTag({content:  readFileSync('test/assets/buffer-5.4.3.min.js').toString() })\r\n\r\n// store a file as a Buffer in window.fileContents3 global variable \r\n// (simulates the image array buffer view extracted from canvas)\r\nawait this.page.evaluate((s) =>\r\n  window.fileContents3 = window.buffer.Buffer.from(s, 'binary')\r\n  , readFileSync('test.mov').toString('binary'))\r\n\r\n// get data as Node.js Buffer\r\nconst fileContents = Buffer.from(await this.page.evaluate(() =>\r\n  window.fileContents3.toString('binary')\r\n), 'binary')\r\nconsole.timeEnd('c')\r\n\r\nwriteFileSync('tmp_test.mov', fileContents)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNumbers aprox are : \r\n * 1.5 mb jpeg : 300ms\r\n * 13mb mov : 2600ms\r\n\r\n(More or less a linear relationship between time+size?)\r\n\r\nAlthough I will keep researching around this, these are some Notes / questions I have. In my particular problem which is passing a HTMLCanvasElement image (both supporting ImageData and encoded images as jpeg, png):\r\n\r\n * It would make any difference to use ` page.exposeFunction()` instead page.evaluate() here in terms of performance ? \r\n * I didn't want to use asDataUrl since string encoding sounds extra overhead that I don't need, but I will give it a try.\r\n * Is it possible to use a node.js Worker consumable from the browser ? (or access a socket using devtools protocols / APIs) ? \r\n + or in general, is it possible to share memory somehow (not copying) perhaps using a devtools protocol API or just posting the data to a local named pipe or net.Server listening at some local addrress/port ? (I know the later is possible but I wonder if it's worthwhile to try)\r\n\r\nBTW I'm building a camera capture node.js library / CLI https://www.npmjs.com/package/camera-capture which is something that currently doesn't exists in npm or very hard to install - and puppeteer makes this job pretty easy . Optionally I can record the video using MediaRecorder (or desktop / audio) .... so so far I'm happy besides this little speed detail . \r\n\r\nIn my case the goal is to pass frames to node.js as fast as possible so they can be processed and rendered \"real-time\" using native libraries in native surfaces (let's say opencv & cairo based application). My best times are 480x320 20fps (but encoded as jpg / webp while Ideally I would like to have the raw image data since the app doesn't need to decode each frame for processing / rendering. \r\n\r\nThanks", "What I ended up doing is either using the filesystem for this or a Node HTTP server I POST to.", "yeap I was thinking on posting to a named pipe or socket and see what happen - but that will complicate code so it must really worth it.  I'm also tempted to postMessage to a native Node.js Worker but I now It won't work just because both things are call workers :) \r\n\r\nI was looking at the sources and the implementation for this issue seems to be not hard - assuming the changes are only in the .js files. since I'm not familiar with the code I wonder if it also should imply modifying C++ ?  thanks  And if designed I think the proper structure to transfer should be ArrayBuffer and not ArrayBufferView what do you say?\r\n\r\nFinally I was thinking about return String.fromCharCode.apply(null, new Uint8Array(buffer)); not about using it since it fails for large arrays, but made me think about the fact that the Uint8Array spreads like number[] arg in that call - I wonder If puppeteer + exposeFunction cannot be cheated in a similar fashion - perhaps sing spread args", "It's actually pretty simple and fast with http:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n          const server = createServer((req, res) => {\r\n            if (req.url.includes('session')) { // \r\n              res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');\r\n              // can parse the body stream here easily and read data from the browser\r\n              res.end(JSON.stringify(DATA_I_WANT_TO_SEND_BACK_FROM_NODE));\r\n              server.close();\r\n            }\r\n          });\r\n          await new Promise(resolve => server.listen(0, resolve));\r\n          const result = await page.evaluate(async (port) => {\r\n            const session = await fetch(`http://localhost:${port}/session`).then(x => x.json());\r\n            // session now available here, we passed a lot of data to puppeteer\r\n            // the other direction is just POSTing it\r\n            return doSomeAction(session);\r\n          }, server.address().port);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe single-width-byte encoding trick was mostly useful when that was hard. \r\n\r\n", "aja I already have an http server for the index.html -   my problem is passing data form browser to node\r\n\r\nI will give a try also using websockets and another experiment I will perform  sharing a webrtc session between node and browser which I think is totally possible and probably optimal for streaming video from pptr to node.js...  in my case (camera capture) that could imply not read/write image data at all and just read the stream in node, If I make it work I will update here. thanks.", "> ```js\r\n> res.end(JSON.stringify(DATA_I_WANT_TO_SEND_BACK_FROM_NOD\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nwhy are you using JSON - I I though you were dealing with array buffer and binary data iin which case could you just write the buffer directly and consume it as array buffer in the browser ?

      "description" : "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nThere's currently no way to manually trigger db compaction. Compactions are only scheduled/executed by the compactor thread/process. Manual compaction triggering would be useful for a few different reasons:\r\n- An administrator may want to schedule a compaction to address a performance problem like high read amplification or poor cache hit rate (due to high space amplification requiring lots of space to cache the working set). For this use case it's probably useful to support both specifying specific SRs to compact, and triggering a major compaction (compact the whole db)\r\n- A user may want to compact the db as a way to detach a clone from it's parent db, once #278 is implemented. In this case we'd want to schedule a major compaction.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nAn extension to the admin tool that lets the user trigger compaction, e.g.:\r\n```\r\nslatedb compact --major # trigger a major compaction\r\nslatedb compact --sources [sst.<L0 ID>] [sst.<L0 ID>] ... [sr.<SR ID>] [sr.<SR ID>] # trigger a compaction of specific SSTs/SRs.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n](https://github.com/slatedb/slatedb/issues/151) has some discussion on how this should actually be implemented. We'd need to address:\r\n1. Where the compaction job actually runs. We want to support running the CLI from a short-lived session, so we probably want to be able to have compaction execute elsewhere - most likely in the compactor process\r\n2. Related to the above, we need some way for the admin to coordinate with the compactor process about the running compaction.  ",

      "comments" : [ "As discussed in the threads of issue https://github.com/slatedb/slatedb/issues/151, I was thinking of designing the CLI based manual compaction based on the following principles:\n\n1. Manifest-based requests: Store compaction requests in manifest for persistence\n2. Compactor polling: Compactor periodically checks for external requests\n3. Status tracking: Request lifecycle from pending ??? in-progress ??? completed/failed\n4. Request Timeout and Cancellation: Provide mechanism for the CLI based client to `Cancel` an externally triggered manual compaction using request.\n\nI would like to capture some of my thoughts below on the structure of the `external_compaction_request` struct and pseudo-code for end to end CLI based manual compaction flow.\n\nI have also added a few Open questions I have addressed below\n\nThe structure of the `external_compaction_request` field to be added to manifest:\n```\n\npub(crate) struct Manifest {\n    pub(crate) external_dbs: Vec<ExternalDb>,\n    pub(crate) core: CoreDbState,\n    pub(crate) writer_epoch: u64,\n    pub(crate) compactor_epoch: u64,\n    pub(crate) external_compaction_requests: Vec<ExternalCompactionRequest>,\n}\n\npub struct ExternalCompactionRequest {\n    /// Unique identifier for the compaction request\n    pub id: Uuid,\n    \n    /// List of source SSTs/SRs to compact (empty for major compaction)\n    pub sources: Vec<SourceId>,\n    \n    /// Optional destination sorted run ID (auto-assigned if None)\n    pub destination: Option<u32>,\n    \n    /// Whether this is a major compaction (compact entire database)\n    pub is_major: bool,\n    \n    /// Current status of the compaction request\n    pub status: ExternalCompactionStatus,\n    \n    /// Timestamp when request was created (seconds since epoch)\n    pub created_at: i64,\n    \n    /// Timestamp when request was last updated (seconds since epoch)\n    pub updated_at: i64,\n    \n    /// Optional timeout in seconds (None = no timeout)\n    pub timeout_seconds: Option<u32>,\n    \n    /// Internal compaction ID for tracking (set when compaction starts)\n    pub compaction_id: Option<Uuid>,\n    \n    /// Optional error message for failed compactions\n    pub error_message: Option<String>,\n    \n    /// Optional progress information\n    pub progress: Option<CompactionProgress>,\n}\n\npub enum ExternalCompactionStatus {\n    /// Request is pending execution\n    Pending,\n    \n    /// Request is currently being executed\n    InProgress,\n    \n    /// Request completed successfully\n    Completed,\n    \n    /// Request failed with error\n    Failed(String),\n    \n    /// Request was cancelled by user\n    Cancelled,\n}\n\npub struct CompactionProgress {\n    /// Total estimated bytes to process\n    pub total_bytes: u64,\n    \n    /// Bytes processed so far\n    pub processed_bytes: u64,\n    \n    /// Estimated completion percentage (0-100)\n    pub completion_percentage: u8,\n    \n    /// Number of SSTs being compacted\n    pub source_sst_count: u32,\n    \n    /// Number of output SSTs created so far\n    pub output_sst_count: u32,\n}\n```\n\nBelow is a rough \n\n### CLI Command Processing\n```\nALGORITHM: ProcessCompactionCommand\nINPUT: command_type, sources[], timeout_seconds\nOUTPUT: request_id\n\n1. GENERATE unique request_id\n2. VALIDATE command parameters:\n   - IF command_type == \"major\": \n     - SET sources = [] (will be populated later)\n   - ELSE IF command_type == \"sources\":\n     - VALIDATE each source ID format (sst.ULID or sr.ID)\n     - IF invalid format: RETURN error\n3. CREATE external_compaction_request:\n   - id = request_id\n   - sources = sources\n   - is_major = (command_type == \"major\")\n   - status = PENDING\n   - created_at = current_timestamp\n   - timeout_seconds = timeout_seconds || default_timeout\n4. CALL Admin.trigger_compaction(request)\n5. RETURN request_id\n```\n\n### Admin API Request Submission\n```\nALGORITHM: Admin.trigger_compaction\nINPUT: external_compaction_request\nOUTPUT: success/failure\n\n1. LOAD latest manifest from object store\n2. VALIDATE request against current DB state:\n   - IF is_major: RETURN success (always valid)\n   - ELSE:\n     - FOR each source in request.sources:\n       - VERIFY source exists in L0 or sorted_runs\n       - IF not found: RETURN validation_error\n     - CHECK for conflicts with ongoing compactions\n     - IF conflicts found: RETURN conflict_error\n3. ADD request to manifest.external_compaction_requests\n4. WRITE updated manifest to object store\n5. RETURN success\n```\n\n###  Compactor Processing Loop\n```\nALGORITHM: CompactorEventHandler.process_external_requests\nINPUT: none\nOUTPUT: none\n\n1. LOAD current manifest\n2. GET pending external compaction requests\n3. FOR each request in pending_requests:\n   - IF max_concurrent_compactions reached: BREAK\n   - VALIDATE request against current state\n   - IF validation fails:\n     - UPDATE request.status = FAILED\n     - CONTINUE to next request\n   - CONVERT external request to internal compaction:\n     - IF request.is_major:\n       - sources = all_l0_ssts + all_sorted_runs\n     - ELSE:\n       - sources = request.sources\n   - SUBMIT internal compaction for execution\n   - UPDATE request.status = IN_PROGRESS\n   - STORE internal_compaction_id mapping\n4. WRITE updated manifest\n```\n### Status Tracking and Updates\n```\nALGORITHM: CompactorEventHandler.handle_compaction_completion\nINPUT: internal_compaction_id, result\nOUTPUT: none\n\n1. FIND external_request_id by internal_compaction_id\n2. IF external_request_id found:\n   - IF result == SUCCESS:\n     - UPDATE external_request.status = COMPLETED\n   - ELSE:\n     - UPDATE external_request.status = FAILED\n   - UPDATE external_request.updated_at = current_timestamp\n3. WRITE updated manifest\n4. CLEAN up internal_compaction_id mapping\n```\n### Timeout and Cancellation Handling\n```\nALGORITHM: CompactorEventHandler.check_timeouts_and_cancellations\nINPUT: none\nOUTPUT: none\n\n1. LOAD current manifest\n2. current_time = get_current_timestamp()\n3. FOR each request in external_compaction_requests:\n   - IF request.status == CANCELLED:\n     - IF internal_compaction_id exists:\n       - CANCEL internal compaction\n       - CLEAN up resources\n   - ELSE IF request.status == IN_PROGRESS:\n     - IF (current_time - request.updated_at) > request.timeout_seconds:\n       - UPDATE request.status = FAILED(\"Timeout\")\n       - CANCEL internal compaction if exists\n4. WRITE updated manifest if changes made\n```\n###  CLI Status Checking\n```\nALGORITHM: ProcessStatusCommand\nINPUT: request_id\nOUTPUT: status_info\n\n1. LOAD latest manifest\n2. FIND request by request_id in external_compaction_requests\n3. IF not found: RETURN \"Request not found\"\n4. RETURN status_info:\n   - request_id\n   - status (PENDING/IN_PROGRESS/COMPLETED/FAILED/CANCELLED)\n   - created_at, updated_at\n   - error_message (if FAILED)\n   - progress_info (if available)\n```\n### Cancellation Command\n```\nALGORITHM: ProcessCancelCommand\nINPUT: request_id\nOUTPUT: success/failure\n\n1. LOAD latest manifest\n2. FIND request by request_id\n3. IF not found: RETURN \"Request not found\"\n4. IF request.status NOT IN [PENDING, IN_PROGRESS]:\n   - RETURN \"Cannot cancel completed request\"\n5. UPDATE request.status = CANCELLED\n6. UPDATE request.updated_at = current_timestamp\n7. WRITE updated manifest\n8. RETURN success\n```\n\n### Open Questions\n1. Should the CLI have a mechanism to be able to cancel manual compactions. The use-case I can think of is manual compactions triggered by mistake\n2. Manual Cancellations might lead to inconsistent states of L0 SSTs and SR. I think this can be handled by gracefully completing the merges in hand and then halting.\n3. Another possible way around cancellations is to cancel the triggered command before it is picked by the executor. In this way, we might get away with any possible inconsistencies in the state.\n\nWdyt?" ],

Manual compaction triggering would be useful for a few different reasons: An administrator may want to schedule a compaction to address a performance problem like high read amplification or poor cache hit rate (due to high space amplification requiring lots of space to cache the working set). A user may want to compact the db as a way to detach a clone from its parent db, once #278 is implemented. In this case, we'd want to schedule a major compaction. The solution would be an extension to the admin tool that lets the user trigger compaction, e.g., slatedb compact --major # trigger a major compaction slatedb compact --sources [sst.<L0 ID>] [sst.<L0 ID>] ... [sr.<SR ID>] [sr.<SR ID>] # trigger a compaction of specific SSTs/SRs.",

However, `docker-compose` interprets `$(...)` as a variable interpolation expression, which leads to the following error:\n\n```bash\nERROR: Invalid interpolation format for \"command\" option in service \"airflow-init: ...\"\n```\n\n<img width=\"940\" height=\"400\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13878911-5cfa-47b6-ae1d-14b763cae6c1\" />\n\n\n\nThis breaks the execution of `docker-compose up airflow-init`, especially when using Docker Compose v2+.\n\n\n### What you think should happen instead?\n\nThe command line should be updated to escape the dollar sign, like this:\n\n```sh\nexport AIRFLOW_UID=$$(id -u)\n```\n\nThis ensures the expression is evaluated in the container shell instead of being interpreted by Docker Compose.\n\nAlternatively, the documentation can recommend using an .env file to predefine AIRFLOW_UID.\n\n### How to reproduce\n\n1. Download the official docker-compose file:\n```bash\ncurl -LfO 'https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/3.0.2/docker-compose.yaml'\n```\n\n2. Run the initialization command:\n```bash\ndocker-compose up airflow-init\n```\n\n3. Observe the interpolation format error in the terminal.\n\n### Operating System\n\nUbuntu 24.04.2 LTS (AWS EC2)\n\n### Versions of Apache Airflow Providers\n\napache/airflow:3.0.2\n\n### Deployment\n\nDocker-Compose\n\n### Deployment details\n\ndocker-compose\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Are you willing to submit PR?\n\n- [x] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n",

We don't want to add probes that give a false sense of security.\r\nWe have these on the webhook where it makes sense as it is an actual HTTPS endpoint serving traffic, which has services relying on it reporting it's state so endpoints can be controlled.\r\n\r\nI took a look at how other Kubernetes operators do this and all ones I use also don't have these probes.\r\nFeedback welcome!", "We actually ran into this too just now and were surprised that there is no health check.\r\n\r\nThere is a metrics endpoint available (https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/blob/master/deploy/charts/cert-manager/templates/deployment.yaml#L106), so a possibility would be to scrape that endpoint to check if the container is up & running. There's quite a few tools that do it like that afaik.\r\n\r\nIn the case we just had, the metrics-endpoint stopped serving traffic when the controller went into some kind of busy-loop. We noticed sometime later and killed / restarted the pod, which resolved the issue. It would be nice if this was handled by the probes instead.\r\n\r\nMaybe it's not possible to distinct between ready & alive, but maybe that's also not needed.", "interesting idea, i never had CM lock up before so couldn't probe it.

Suggest to create a http tx submission API\n\n### Suggested solution\n\nSuggested to create an API for http transaction submit with same behaviour as any L1 provider tx submission (like [blockforst](https://docs.blockfrost.io/#tag/cardano--transactions/POST/tx/submit)). Hydra specific suggestion:\n- Return a `txHash` as response if the transaction is `TxValid` and accepted to the mempool\n- Not exactly have to wait for snapshot confirm\n\n### Alternative\n\nIt is also possible to:\n- Return a `txHash` as response if the transaction is `TxValid` + `SnapshotConfirmed`\n- While it might not be commonplace for L1 provider as it takes long time to be included in blocks in general, it has much faster response on confirming in snapshot of hydra technically, so make this alternative possible\n\nIf that's evaluated to be also a good idea, suggest to provide both options:\n- http tx submit, response on `TxValid`\n- http tx submit, response on `SnapshotConfirmed`\n\nSo for different users, they can choose which one to use.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

For example using a [previous ADR draft](https://hydra.family/head-protocol/adr/25):\n\n- Handle requests to `POST /head/ledger/transactions` like the `NewTx` command on the websocket\n  - Require `application/json` request body containing the JSON encoded [`Transaction` envelope](https://hydra.family/head-protocol/api-reference#schema-Transaction)\n  - The handler blocks for a configurable maximum time until either of the following happens:\n    - Respond with `400 Bad Request` upon seeing a `TxInvalid` with the transaction and validation errors in the response body\n    - Respond with `200 OK` upon seeing the transaction in a `SnapshotConfirmed` with at least the snapshot number in the response body\n    - Respond with `202 Accepted` if only a `TxValid` but no `SnapshotConfirmed` was seen within the configurable time limit\n\n- Add a `--api-transaction-timeout 10s` command line option that configures the maximum time to wait for a snapshot confirmed and before only yielding the Accepted response\n\n@HinsonSIDAN Any opinions on verb, path and responses?", "The spec looks pretty good. One quick question I have, what is the lowest possible time to configure at `--api-transaction-timeout`? For example, one use case we have is we want the `202` as long as there is `TxValid`. Should we just set it as `0s`? Related question, can we set as `ms` but not `s`?", "Both possible. If the \"async variant\" of only waiting on `TxValid` is major use case we can also make it more of a first class request. Maybe through a query parameter or so. By making it a timeout (which can be also `0.001s` if you want) I thought we could encourage users to rely on the `SnapshotConfirmed`, for the `TxValid` alone is **unsafe** and cannot be considered \"done\"." ],

      "comments" : [ "<!-- Greeting -->\nHi @DoItEric! I'm [Dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot) and I???m helping the dify team.\n\n<!-- Answer -->\nThis error happens because the agent node backend expects certain parameters (like arrays of tools or objects) to be passed as a list of dictionaries, but when you select a variable or output that is just a string, it tries to call .get on each item and fails???since strings don???t have a .get method. This is a type mismatch in the workflow parameter binding logic, not an intentional design, and is best described as a bug or missing validation in Dify v1.5.1. When LLM auto-fill is enabled, the UI ensures the correct type is passed, so you don???t see the error.\n\nTo avoid this, make sure that when you bind a parameter that expects an array of objects (like tools), the variable or output you select is actually a list of dicts, not a string. If your workflow only produces strings, you???ll need to adjust it so the output matches the expected structure, or keep LLM fill-in enabled for those parameters. There???s also recent work to support more flexible variable selection and type validation for parameters (see [this PR](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/18558)), which may help in future versions.\n\nFor now, the safest workaround is to use LLM fill-in for these parameters, or ensure your variables/outputs are structured as lists of dicts when required. Improving backend validation and UI restrictions would help prevent this error in the future.  \nRelevant code reference: [_generate_agent_parameters expects a list of dicts, not a string_](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/blob/51f6095be7da87cbf0f49f24dd0c2f0a84944939/api/core/workflow/nodes/agent/agent_node.py).\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

      "description" : "Hi, I'm looking to perhaps migrate from glob to fdir and one big blocker for me is that glob allows you to inject a custom \"fs\" implementation like so:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// in-memory filesystem module, which works in the browser\r\nimport memfs from 'memfs';\r\n\r\nglob('**/*.json', { fs: memfs });\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be cool if the node builtin modules could be optionally substituted, e.g. `path-unified` is an NPM package which is just a `node:path` clone that works in the browser out of the box, and `memfs` would be a good `node:fs` replacement.\r\n\r\nThe path replacement is basically always a good idea because that module has no reason not to work in a browser env, the fs module is slightly harder because browser doesn't have filesystem access by default, you either need to use an in-memory replacement or an adapter which makes it interact with the browser's filesystem access API (bit more complicated). memfs allows doing both, fortunately.\r\n\r\nYou can use package entrypoints for example to internally do this in your package:\r\n```js\r\nimport fs from 'fdir/fs';\r\n```\r\nusing:\r\n```json5\r\n{\r\n  \"exports\": {\r\n    \"./fs\": {\r\n      \"node\": \"./lib/fs-node.js\", // re-exports \"node:fs\"\r\n      \"default\": \"./lib/fs-browser.js\", // re-exports an empty variable \"export let fs;\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nso when not in a Node env, this lib would require the user to pass \"fs\" as an option to any fdir calls, similar to how you do it in glob, since there isn't a default fallback. You could also set a default fallback -> `memfs` instead of \"empty variable\", up to you.\r\n\r\nIf you're at all interested in this approach to make this lib work in browser out of the box without any bundler shenanigans, I'd be happy to investigate this and open a PR",

      "description" : "## Please help us translate Ghost to your language!\n\n### General needs\n- Contribute new languages (provided you speak them fluently or near-fluently)\n- Help complete languages that are only partially translated\n- Improve the quality of existing translations\n- Fix errors (see below)\n\n### Notes & tips\n\n\uD83D\uDD16 For help getting started, see https://forum.ghost.org/t/help-translate-ghost-beta/37461 - the original directions were only for portal, but can be generalized to any language file.\n\n\uD83E\uDD16 **NO AI translations, please**. Native/very fluent speakers only.\n\n??? **Read your email!**  Please make sure you have your Github notifications sent somewhere you will see them.  Most PRs need at least one round of adjustment before merging.  \n\n\uD83C\uDD95 New Github users are welcome!  When you submit your PR, please make sure that the \"files changed\" tab shows only the changes you intended to make.  If you have questions, please leave a comment and I'll try to help get you sorted out. \n\n\uD83D\uDC4B **Formality**: Ghost's brand has a friendly and fairly informal tone.  If your language has both formal and informal form, choose one or the other and use it consistently.  Most languages are using the informal version, but if the informal version might be considered rude, then choose the formal.\n\n\uD83E\uDD17  All kinds of people use Ghost.  When possible, prefer gender-neutral language.\n\n\uD83D\uDC4D Translations should work for a variety of Ghost sites.  Choose translations that will make sense for both personal blogs/newsletters and news publications.  \n\n\uD83D\uDC49 Please @ cathysarisky if you add a language PR.  Thanks!\n\n### Common issues to avoid & other notes:\n- Please give your PR a descriptive title that includes the language you are working on.\n- Check before starting that there isn't another PR for the same language.  If there is, please review it rather than duplicating work.\n- Consult the [context.json](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/main/ghost/i18n/locales/context.json) file if you aren't sure how a string will be used.  \n- We use *\"Jamie Larson\"* for a placeholder in any field that needs a name.  Please do not transliterate.  Please do not replace with \"Name\".  Instead, choose a name that will be recognized as a name in your language.  Choose something uncontroversial and common.  If possible, choose a non-gendered name.\n- Do not translate variables (inside {}).  Do not add variables.  If you remove a variable, leave a note (see \"Known Errors\" below).\n- Watch out for \"You are receiving this because you are a <strong>%%{status}%% subscriber</strong> to {site}.'\", which takes the \"free\", \"trialing\", \"paid\", and \"complimentary\" strings in the %%{status}%% field.  These strings need to work together.\n- If you are changing existing translations, please leave an explanation of why. \n\n### Completion status (last generated 7/4/2025):\n\n| Language | Need translation | Completion % | Invalid Variables | Missing Variables | Intentional Overrides |\n|----------|------------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------|\n| Hungarian (hu) \uD83E\uDD47 | 0 | 100% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Punjabi (pa) \uD83E\uDD47 | 0 | 100% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Russian (ru) \uD83E\uDD47 | 0 | 100% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Spanish (es) \uD83E\uDD48 | 5 | 99% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Bulgarian (bg) \uD83E\uDD48 | 8 | 98% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Italian (it) \uD83E\uDD48 | 9 | 98% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Vietnamese (vi) \uD83E\uDD48 | 8 | 98% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Mongolian (mn) \uD83E\uDD49 | 13 | 97% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Polish (pl) \uD83E\uDD49 | 13 | 97% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Danish (da) \uD83E\uDD49 | 14 | 96% | 1 ??? | 0 | 0 |\n| German (de) \uD83E\uDD49 | 14 | 96% | 0 | 0 | 1 ??? |\n| Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR) \uD83E\uDD49 | 14 | 96% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Turkish (tr) \uD83E\uDD49 | 15 | 96% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Swiss German (de-CH) | 26 | 93% | 2 ??? | 3 ??? | 0 |\n| Norwegian Bokm??l (nb) | 28 | 93% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Slovenian (sl) | 27 | 93% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Catalan (ca) | 31 | 92% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Scottish Gaelic (gd) | 30 | 92% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Croatian (hr) | 30 | 92% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Latvian (lv) | 31 | 92% | 1 ??? | 0 | 0 |\n| Dutch (nl) | 29 | 92% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Chinese (Traditional) (zh-Hant) | 30 | 92% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Slovak (sk) | 34 | 91% | 0 | 1 ??? | 0 |\n| French (fr) | 37 | 90% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Arabic (ar) | 43 | 89% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Hebrew (he) | 41 | 89% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Korean (ko) | 41 | 89% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Swedish (sv) | 41 | 89% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Hindi (hi) | 65 | 83% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Indonesian (id) | 65 | 83% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Tamil (ta) | 65 | 83% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Ukrainian (uk) | 65 | 83% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Czech (cs) | 78 | 79% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Romanian (ro) | 81 | 78% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Portuguese (pt) | 85 | 77% | 0 | 1 ??? | 0 |\n| Estonian (et) | 101 | 73% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Chinese (Simplified) (zh) | 102 | 73% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Japanese (ja) | 108 | 71% | 0 | 2 ??? | 0 |\n| Serbian (Cyrillic) (sr-Cyrl) | 111 | 70% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Bosnian (bs) | 121 | 68% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Greek (el) | 121 | 68% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Persian (fa) | 121 | 68% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Kazakh (kz) | 121 | 68% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Lithuanian (lt) | 121 | 68% | 0 | 1 ??? | 0 |\n| Afrikaans (af) | 123 | 67% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Macedonian (mk) | 125 | 67% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Swahili (sw) | 125 | 67% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Bengali (bn) | 126 | 66% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Sinhala (si) | 128 | 66% | 2 ??? | 0 | 0 |\n| Thai (th) | 127 | 66% | 1 ??? | 0 | 0 |\n| Finnish (fi) | 135 | 64% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Urdu (ur) | 140 | 63% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Icelandic (is) | 192 | 49% | 1 ??? | 1 ??? | 0 |\n| Norwegian Nynorsk (nn) | 192 | 49% | 0 | 2 ??? | 0 |\n| Malay (ms) | 196 | 48% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Albanian (sq) | 204 | 46% | 0 | 2 ??? | 0 |\n| Nepali (ne) | 217 | 42% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Serbian (sr) | 234 | 38% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Esperanto (eo) | 295 | 22% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Uzbek (uz) | 295 | 22% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n\n#### Known errors\nSome existing translations in ghost/i18n/locales/**/*.json may have errors in usage of variables.  Variables, surrounded by { } (always a single set, not doubles) should match in the key (left side) and value (right side). They should never translated.  New variables should *never* be added to the right side, as they will not be correctly substituted.  If a variable is not present on the right side, one should generally suspect an error, although a few may be deliberate.\n\nIf your language has any \"Invalid Variables\" listed above, these need to be corrected.  Your strings will not display correctly.  If your theme has \"Missing variables\", these might or might not be intentional.  You can edit the error tracking file below to update anything intentional to explain your choice.\n\nErrors are tracked in [ghost/i18n/test/i18n-ignores.json](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/main/ghost/i18n/test/i18n-ignores.json) .  If you correct an error, you can also delete the override.\n\n\n\n",

Some pages in the Launchpad manual have broken internal links because they have been recently migrated from another site and are yet to be correctly linked to each other. Launchpad's docs are now hosted on Read the Docs and are written in restructured text or markdown. When linking these docs, it is recommended that the [:ref: method](https://canonical-starter-pack.readthedocs-hosted.com/latest/reference/style-guide/#internal-references) described in the style guide be used. Using :ref: instead of a file path makes it less likely that the link will break if a file is renamed or moved to a different folder.\n\nTask\n-------\nThe page linked below has one or more broken internal links. Direct the links to the correct pages within the docs using the :ref: method mentioned above. You may need to add a target to a file you're linking to if one is not already present.\n\n[your-launchpad-account](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/launchpad/en/latest/user/explanation/your-launchpad-account/)",

[(utils._set_output.py)](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/main/sklearn/utils/_set_output.py)\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef _auto_wrap_is_configured(estimator):\r\n    \"\"\"Return True if estimator is configured for auto-wrapping the transform method.\r\n\r\n    `_SetOutputMixin` sets `_sklearn_auto_wrap_output_keys` to `set()` if auto wrapping\r\n    is manually disabled.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    auto_wrap_output_keys = getattr(estimator, \"_sklearn_auto_wrap_output_keys\", set())\r\n    return (\r\n        hasattr(estimator, \"get_feature_names_out\")\r\n        and \"transform\" in auto_wrap_output_keys\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n To have **'get_feature_names_out'** attr, estimator should inherit OneToOneFeatureMixin as I think.

", "> When I was debugging this, I did not find a way to hide the method from Sphinx.\n\ntechnically one case use the exclude-members option to hide certain methods\n\nhttps://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html#directive-option-autoclass-exclude-members", "/take", "I???ve looked into this, and indeed the root of the problem is how the [@available_if](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/543092020dc1bfa42b7722c9245b53cf277fe1b4/sklearn/utils/_available_if.py#L57) decorator works, as even though it makes `LabelEncoder().set_output` raise AttributeError, `set_output` is still in `dir(LabelEncoder)`, and `LabelEncoder.set_output` does give back the `_SetOutputMixin.set_output` method. So sphinx will find it as a member of the class to be documented ([see here](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/blob/ca043c3ccdc88ae5d30e4527382fe0c8bd5e2a88/sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py#L1968)).\n\nI see a few possible ways to remove the documentation:\n\n- I think the best solution would be to separate [`TransformerMixin`](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/543092020dc1bfa42b7722c9245b53cf277fe1b4/sklearn/base.py#L801) and [`_SetOutputMixin`](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/543092020dc1bfa42b7722c9245b53cf277fe1b4/sklearn/utils/_set_output.py#L347) (and expose the latter too), so have the `set_output` method opt-in instead of opt-out, but that would be a breaking change.\n\n- Adding `:exclude-members: set_output` to the [doc template](scikit-learn/doc/templates/base.rst) as @Remi-Gau suggested, but then it's never documented (maybe would be good as a temporary solution?).\n\n- For classes that don???t want to implement `set_output`, we could override it by one raising NotImplementedError (and having a docstring that makes sphinx skip it, by adding `:meta private:`), although that kind of goes against the magic using the `available_if` decorator and the `auto_wrap_output_keys` param. (Other such classes are LabelBinarizer, MultiLabelBinarizer, HashingVectorizer and TfidfTransformer.)\n\nWays that don???t work (currently):\n\n- In sphinx, one can connect a method to call back when autodoc is deciding wether a member should be documented or skipped [like here](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/bde701db13cebd5d5ed0bc049fb0bc9693c6c5dc/doc/conf.py#L848), but unfortunately (as of 8.1.3), is only gets the member method and not the parent class, so it???s not really possible to distinguish the `set_output` method of a class that has it or not, because it still exists in the cases when it???s not callable, and it???s the same function object (except maybe using inspect???).\n\n- Trying to remove the method with `delattr(LabelEncoder, \"set_output\")` raises AttributeError.\n\nAre there any preferences?", "There is a similar issue with linked PRs in https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/28558. In particular https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28749 was on a good trajectory to solving this but then the original PR creator closed it. Maybe worth restarting that PR\n\nThe issue solves a different, but I think, related problem: the fact that tab completion and `dir(some_estimator)` will list methods that don't exist because the default `__dir__` implementation doesn't understand the `available_if` decorator" ],

      "description" : "## Motivation\n\nThe [ICORE (International CORE Conference Rankings)](https://www.core.edu.au/home) is a ranking of computer science conferences (A*, A, B, C). In JabRef, we want to add a new field that stores the ICORE ranking of a given conference. Users often want to know how highly ranked a paper's venue is. You can search conferences manually via the [ICORE website](https://portal.core.edu.au/conf-ranks/), but this should be automated.\n\nExample search result\n\n<img width=\"1280\" height=\"246\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2f0efc5-f6ef-48b8-8e81-929e54cb9b3d\" />\n\n## \uD83D\uDCCC Goal\n\nWhen a BibTeX entry includes a conference title like:\n\n`ACIS Conference on Software Engineering Research, Management and Applications (SERA)`\n\nThe tool should:\n\n- Extract the acronym in parentheses ??? SERA.\n- Search the ICORE rankings for this acronym.\n- If a match is found (e.g. SERA has rank C), populate the new icoreranking field with that value.\n- If no exact match is found, fall back to fuzzy matching using similarity scoring (> 0.9).\n\n## \uD83D\uDEE0??? Tasks\n\n- [ ] Move DuplicateCheck#similarity from org.jabref.logic.database to a new utility class: org.jabref.logic.util.strings.StringSimilarity.\n- [ ] Add ICORE.csv to src/main/resources/\n- [ ] Create a class that loads and indexes the ICORE data at instantiation.\n- [ ] Implement the logic to detect and return the ranking from a full conference name.\n- [ ] Create a new field: ICORANKING ('icoranking') and add it to org.jabref.model.entry.field.StandardField at the // JabRef-specific fields section.\n- [ ] Create a new field editor ICoreRankingEditor (inspired by IdentifierEditor) and integrate it into the UI by modifying FieldEditors#getForField(...). - Tghe lookup button (like DOI lookup) to lookup the ranking in the `CSV` file\n- [ ] Write unit tests for acronym matching and similarity fallback.\n\nTest end-to-end behavior via TDD.\n\n##  \uD83D\uDCDA Helpful resources\n\n[How to contribute to JabRef](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing)\n\n[JabRef Developer Documentation](https://devdocs.jabref.org/)\n\nICORE Rankings CSV: https://portal.core.edu.au/conf-ranks/ ???

\n\nSorry for the late reply.\nFor the implementation now, certificate will include NF ID, which is generated when the NF start. \nSo each time you restart the NF, the new NF ID is used, so the NRF will generate new certificate and each registered NF as well. \n\nAs the result, if the pre generated certificate required, the implementation should be modify for NRF and each NF. \n\nYou can keep this issue open since this is good first issue (feature/improvement) for free5gc. \n\nThanks!" ],
