These stories need improving.\n\nHow can you find these ones that need more states?\n\nIf you run make frontend-test from the root of the repo you'll see it prints out some code coverage.\n`cd frontend && npm run test -- --coverage`\n\nFrom that you could see if there's any more major code paths that might need covering with more story states.\n(There's a html report in coverage/index.html as well with more details)\n\n\n## Where should the stories go?\n\nA good example to look at is `src/components/common/ActionButton`.\n\nThe preferred layout is the folder layout like this:\n\n```\nComponent/Component.tsx, main place where the component goes. Named after the component.\nComponent/index.tsx, This should export things from Component.tsx\nComponent/Component.stories.tsx, contains the component shown in different states.\nComponent/__snapshots__ , where the story shot files are.\n```\n\n## Presentational VS container (logic) components\n\nSee [documentation here](link-to-story-js). In short, the logic should be separated so mainly the component can be tested without dependencies on other things. An example of logic that could be separated is API calls.\n\nSome refactoring is probably needed to implement stories:\n\n- to place components in a folder, with filenames the same name as the component\n- to separate the presentational \"pure\" parts\n\n## viewing the stories, and running the tests\n\nTo view the storybook:\n\n```bash\ncd frontend\nnpm install\nnpm run storybook\n```\n\nTo run the tests, and generate the snapshot files (rendered html):\n\n```bash\ncd frontend\nnpm install # not needed if you've done it already.\nnpm run test -- --coverage\n```\n\nYou can also run the tests without the interactive test runner like this:\n```bash\nCI=true npm run test -- --coverage\n```\n",

It also provided ability for companies to run scripts on the EC2 machines securely using it's RunCommand feature. Adding SSM RunCommand Operator to the Amazon provider package will unlock migration to Airflow from legacy job scheduling frameworks like AutoSys\n\n### Use case/motivation\n\nI work with a few customers that are in the process of migrating jobs from AutoSys and other legacy frameworks to Airflow. For these customers, a lot of their existing jobs are in shell scripts running on EC2. When they migrate to Airflow, they are looking for an easy way to lift those scripts and run on Airflow. SSHOperator could be an option for this but in many corporate environments, SSH is disabled for security reasons. One of the secure ways AWS recommends executing a remote script on EC2 is by using SSM RunCommand.\n\n### Related issues\n\n_No response_\n\n### Are you willing to submit a PR?\n\n- [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n",

      "description" : "### What's the problem this feature will solve?\n\nOur efforts in adopting MLIR within the MQT have been steadily progressing.\n#880 is the first PR that adds interoperability with an external framework, namely Xanadu's Catalyst and their `Quantum` dialect.\nTo connect the ecosystem further and to extend the compatibility of the MQT, this issue aims to add support for NVIDIA's `quake` dialect that is used within CUDA-Q. See https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-quantum/blob/main/Overview.md for a brief overview.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nSimilarly to the solution currently being pursued in #880, it should be possible to translate MLIR programs using the Quake dialect to our internal `mqtopt` or `mqtdyn` (see comment below for more details) dialect and back.\nThe conversion itself can probably borrow quite a few of the implementation details from #880.\nThe intriguing aspect is the packaging aspect in the sense that it is still an open question how to best add these translations without adding an unconditional dependency on cuda-q. Ideally, the integration is set up similar to how we currently handle Qiskit as an optional plugin of the mqt-core Python package: https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/core/tree/main/src/mqt/core/plugins/qiskit",

      "comments" : [ "We currently have two MLIR dialects: `mqtopt` and `mqtdyn`. \n`mqtopt` uses value semantics, i.e. each operation \"consumes\" a quantum state and returns an updated state.\n`mqtdyn` uses memory semantics. Here, each operation is performed on a reference to a qubit, similar to e.g. OpenQASM's `x q[0]`.\n\nAs Quake supports memory semantics (`!quake.ref`) *and* value semantics (`!quake.wire`), this makes conversions a bit more complex. We would rather not have a mix between `mqtopt` and `mqtdyn`, so the Quake operations should be converted to only one of the two dialects. I can see both of them making sense:\n\n- *Convert to `mqtdyn`*: `!quake.ref` operations can be converted directly to `mqtdyn` qubits. For `!quake.wire` operations, search the reference it was originally pulled from through the `quake.unwrap` operation and use that information to translate the wire into a `mqtdyn` qubit.\n- *Convert to `mqtopt`*: `!quake.wire` operations can be converted directly to `mqtopt` qubits and their corresponding `quake.wrap`/`quake.unwrap` calls roughly align with `mqtopt.extractQubit` and `mqtopt.insertQubit` calls. For `!quake.ref` operations, `mqtopt` qubits can be extracted from a register using `mqtopt.extractQubit`. Here, we have to keep track in detail what qubit comes from what `mqtopt`-register-index and from what `quake.ref` to make sure different operations do not interfere with each other.\n\nBoth approaches seem reasonable, but the first one (converting to `mqtdyn`) seems a bit simpler and may therefore be the better solution, intuitively." ],

Display formatting logic\n- `/modules/core/domain/value_objects/phone/formatter_test.go` - Test coverage\n- `/components/base/phone/phone.templ` - Phone display component\n- `/components/base/phone/phone_templ.go` - Generated templ file\n\n**Modified Files**:\n- Update existing templates to use the new phone component\n- Add phone component to component registry if needed\n\n### 5. **Testing Strategy**\n- **Unit Tests**: Format validation for different countries\n- **Integration Tests**: Component rendering with various props\n- **Template Tests**: Verify anchor tag generation and tel: links\n\n### 6. **Benefits**\n- **Leverages Existing Infrastructure**: Uses current phone value object and country detection\n- **Consistent Formatting**: Centralized formatting logic across all templates\n- **Accessibility**: Proper tel: links for mobile devices\n- **Extensible**: Easy to add new formatting styles\n- **Type Safe**: Follows Go and templ best practices\n\nThis implementation provides a complete phone display component that transforms raw phone numbers into user-friendly, clickable links while maintaining the existing robust phone number infrastructure.\n\n**Implementation Status**: ✅ **Plan Complete** -

Create Landing Page with AutoEDA Introduction\nDescription:\nDesign a visually appealing React+ Vite landing page that introduces the purpose of AutoEDA. Include a headline, and a subheadline. Implement animations to look more techy.\n\n### 3. Add File Upload UI for CSV Files\nDescription:\nImplement a drag-and-drop file upload area (with a fallback button). Ensure only .csv files are accepted, and show the filename once a file is selected.\n\n### 4. Display Success Message After File Upload\nDescription:\nAfter a CSV file is uploaded, display a success toast or modal with a confirmation message. Also include basic feedback for invalid file formats.\n\n**Advice:-**\n\n1. Use TailwindCSS, ShadCN UI, Material UI, or similar for a clean and impactful design.\n2.

Would be very handy for those cases :smile: \n\n### Alternatives\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional information\n\nThis is a duplicate of https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/issues/918, which unfortunately was closed by the author",

Would be very handy for those cases \uD83D\uDE04\n> \n> ### Alternatives\n> _No response_\n> \n> ### Additional information\n> This is a duplicate of [#918](https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/issues/918), which unfortunately was closed by the author\n\nHi is this issue still existing and open? I would love to look into this as I have worked on something like this before", "hey @devpool007 \uD83D\uDC4B \n\nThis still happens, feel free to take a look into it :) ", "> hey [@devpool007](https://github.com/devpool007) \uD83D\uDC4B\n> \n> This still happens, feel free to take a look into it :)\n\nThanks for the reply! Ok I try to look into it :) \nAlso from what I understood, you encounter this issue on linux right? Could you let me know what OS you are using btw?", "I'm on CachyOS (arch-linux on wayland) with Hyprland as the DE. I believe the issue is platform-agnostic though, but I might be wrong." ],

      "url" : "https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy/issues/9094",
      "repositoryName" : "aquasecurity/trivy",
      "description" : "## Description\n\nThis is a feature request to add SHA-512 hash algorithm support to Trivy's SBOM parsing capabilities. Currently, Trivy only supports SHA-1, SHA-256, and MD5 hash algorithms when processing SBOM files.\n\nSome tools, particularly NPM's SBOM generation (`npm sbom`), use SHA-512 hashes for package integrity verification. Adding SHA-512 support would enable Trivy to fully process these SBOMs and preserve important security metadata.\n\n### Current limitations:\n- **CycloneDX**: SHA-512 hashes are ignored and the hashes field becomes `null`\n- **SPDX**: SHA-512 checksums are completely omitted from the output\n\n\n## Current Behavior\n\n### CycloneDX\nIn `pkg/sbom/cyclonedx/unmarshal.go:251-268`, the `unmarshalHashes` function only supports:\n- SHA1\n- SHA256\n- MD5\n\nAny other algorithm (including SHA-512) logs a warning but still creates a digest with an empty algorithm prefix (e.g., `:hashvalue` instead of `sha512:hashvalue`), resulting in malformed digest strings.\n\n### SPDX\nIn `pkg/sbom/spdx/marshal.go:501-522`, the `spdxChecksums` function has the same limitation, returning `nil` for unsupported algorithms.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe limitation stems from `pkg/digest/digest.go` which only defines three algorithms:\n```go\nconst (\n    SHA1   Algorithm = \"sha1\"\n    SHA256 Algorithm = \"sha256\"\n    MD5    Algorithm = \"md5\"\n)\n```\n\n## Desired Behavior\n\nTrivy should support SHA-512 hash algorithm alongside the existing SHA-1, SHA-256, and MD5 support. This would enable Trivy to:\n- Preserve SHA-512 hashes when processing SBOMs from NPM and other tools\n- Generate SBOMs with SHA-512 hashes when appropriate\n- Maintain full compatibility with CycloneDX and SPDX specifications\n\n\n## Impact\n\n- Loss of package integrity verification data\n- Generated SBOMs may be invalid or incomplete\n- Affects tools that rely on SHA-512 for security validation\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n1. Add SHA512 constant to `pkg/digest/digest.go`:\n   ```go\n   const (\n       SHA1   Algorithm = \"sha1\"\n       SHA256 Algorithm = \"sha256\"\n       SHA512 Algorithm = \"sha512\"\n       MD5    Algorithm = \"md5\"\n   )\n   ```\n\n2. Add SHA-512 calculation support in the digest package\n\n3. Update `unmarshalHashes` in CycloneDX:\n   ```go\n   case cdx.HashAlgoSHA512:\n       alg = digest.SHA512\n   ```\n\n4. Update `spdxChecksums` in SPDX:\n   ```go\n   case digest.SHA512:\n       alg = spdx.SHA512\n   ```\n\n## References\n\n- NPM SBOM documentation: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npm-sbom\n- CycloneDX hash algorithm specification: https://cyclonedx.org/docs/1.6/json/#components_items_hashes\n- SPDX checksum specification: https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/package-information/#79-package-checksum-field\n\n## Test Data\n\n### CycloneDX Example\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"http://cyclonedx.org/schema/bom-1.5.schema.json\",\n  \"bomFormat\": \"CycloneDX\",\n  \"specVersion\": \"1.5\",\n  \"components\": [\n    {\n      \"bom-ref\": \"lodash@4.17.21\",\n      \"type\": \"library\",\n      \"name\": \"lodash\",\n      \"version\": \"4.17.21\",\n      \"hashes\": [\n        {\n          \"alg\": \"SHA-512\",\n          \"content\": \"bf690311ee7b95e713ba568322e3533f2dd1cb880b189e99d4edef13592b81764daec43e2c54c61d5c558dc5cfb35ecb85b65519e74026ff17675b6f8f916f4a\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### SPDX Example\n```json\n{\n  \"spdxVersion\": \"SPDX-2.3\",\n  \"packages\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"lodash\",\n      \"SPDXID\": \"SPDXRef-Package-lodash-4.17.21\",\n      \"checksums\": [\n        {\n          \"algorithm\": \"SHA512\",\n          \"checksumValue\": \"bf690311ee7b95e713ba568322e3533f2dd1cb880b189e99d4edef13592b81764daec43e2c54c61d5c558dc5cfb35ecb85b65519e74026ff17675b6f8f916f4a\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Discussed in https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy/discussions/9082\n",

This option is _only_ available on the dashboard. So to start an instant meeting while in a conversation, one first has to drop to the dashboard to then create the meeting. (and understand, that the option is only there)\n\nI think we should consider adding this option to the \"add\" menu as well, so it is reachable even outside the dashboard.",

This launch task can be set to have upstream dependencies, however no matter what the launch task will not wait on any dependencies to execute, executing as soon as the dag run starts.\nThis keeps us from using any parameters defined as part of a task that is intended to run before the task group initializes, for example setting parameters in the task group definition.\n\n\n### What you think should happen instead\n\nThis task should instead wait on prior tasks to finish as aligned with the trigger_rule assigned to that specific task. As the trigger_rule by default for the launch task is set to all_success, the task should NOT run until all upstream dependencies have finished.\n\n<img width=\"674\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83abb3ce-1d36-4e12-b485-b0855a0caf2b\" />\n<img width=\"982\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/836fcfe2-21c4-4784-b470-ac2d2dca2e54\" />\n\n### How to reproduce\n\n```from airflow.models import DAG\nfrom airflow.operators.dummy import DummyOperator\nfrom airflow.providers.databricks.operators.databricks_workflow import (\n    DatabricksWorkflowTaskGroup,\n)\nwith DAG(\n    dag_id=\"example_dag\",\n    schedule_interval=f\"0 0 * * *\",\n) as dag:\n    start_task = DummyOperator(task_id=\"end\", trigger_rule=\"none_failed\")\n\n    task_group = DatabricksWorkflowTaskGroup(\n        group_id=\"tg\",\n        databricks_conn_id=\"FILL IN DBX CONNECTION ID\",\n        job_clusters={\n            \"job_cluster_key\": \"test_cluster\",\n            \"new_cluster\": {\n                \"cluster_name\": \"\",\n                \"spark_version\": \"15.4.x-scala2.12\",\n                \"node_type_id\": \"r4.2xlarge\",\n                \"num_workers\": 1,\n                \"autoscale\": {\"min_workers\": 2, \"max_workers\": 8},\n                \"aws_attributes\": {\n                    \"availability\": \"SPOT_WITH_FALLBACK\",\n                    \"ebs_volume_count\": 1,\n                    \"ebs_volume_size\": 100,\n                    \"ebs_volume_type\": \"GENERAL_PURPOSE_SSD\",\n                    \"first_on_demand\": 1,\n                    \"spot_bid_price_percent\": 100,\n                    \"zone_id\": \"auto\",\n                },\n            },\n        },\n    )\n\n    with task_group:\n        pass\n```\n### Anything else\n\n_No response_\n\n### Are you willing to submit PR?\n\n- [x] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n",

      "description" : "### Summary\n\nAt the login screen, sometimes we need to enter a verification code received by email, likely when we sign up on a new device. This email verification input field appears after providing the correct username and password. \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Freshly install the Commons App\n2. Open the app and try to log in with your username and password\n3. An email verification input field should appear\n4. Make sure email verification input field is focused\n5. Tap on the `Enter` button in the software keyboard of Android\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nThe **IME Action** for the email verification input field should be either `Done` or `Go`. Also, the input field's height shouldn't increase when pressing the `Enter` button.\n\n### Actual behaviour\n\nThe `Enter` **IME Action** is displayed in the Android's soft keyboard, and tapping that increases the input field's height.\n\n### Device name\n\nPixel 6\n\n### Android version\n\nAndroid 14\n\n### Commons app version\n\nMain Branch\n\n### Device logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### Screen-shots\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7177768-7721-405e-a838-90b12a1a6a9c\n\n### Would you like to work on the issue?\n\nPrefer not",

The following sections will be managed by moderators only._\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n\n* When module settings are being saved, after CTA has been clicked and CTA enters in progress state, only spinner icon should be showing, text shouldn't be changing to the `Saving` and ellipsis should not show `...`\n\n## Implementation Brief\n\n* [x] Update `assets/js/components/settings/SettingsActiveModule/FooterPrimaryAction.js`\n  * Remove https://github.com/google/site-kit-wp/blob/4946f1a5df79dfac2ac8f94c6a03283a163241a1/assets/js/components/settings/SettingsActiveModule/FooterPrimaryAction.js#L75 and conditional wrapper around it.\n  * Spinner is already integrated, so no further change is needed\n\n### Test Coverage\n\n* No updates expected\n\n## QA Brief\n\n1. Open any module's settings in `Site Kit > Settings`.\n\n2. Make any changes to the module, when the settings are being saved, the button text should stay as `Confirm changes` and not `Saving...`. Refer attached screenshots.\n\n#### Before\n\n<img width=\"538\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bb85e75-191a-445f-aa63-a17394d88c44\" />\n\n#### Latest change\n\n<img width=\"685\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55bcc527-4db0-4535-bdd5-a93952abfa30\" />\n\n## Changelog entry\n\n* <!-- One sentence summarizing the PR, to be used in the changelog. -->\n",

I've tried to analyze the macOS compatibility issues in the Nebraska development scripts and I would like to point out thefollowing potential problems:\n\n1. **Bash version incompatibility**:\n  - `backend/tools/check_pkg_test.sh` uses `mapfile` (line 11), which was introduced in bash 4.0\n  - [macOS ships with bash 3.2 because they have licensing problems](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255353799?answerId=259964001022&sortBy=rank#259964001022)\n\n2. **GNU vs BSD utilities**:\n  - `backend/tools/setup_local_db.sh` and `backend/tools/run-all.sh` use GNU getopt with `--longoptions`\n  - macOS ships with BSD getopt which doesn't support long options like `--longoptions`\n  - This is a fundamental difference between BSD and GNU implementations\n\n3. **There might be other similar compatibility issues, e.g. in**:\n  - backend/tools/run-all.sh - uses GNU getopt with long options and bash arrays\n\n### Potential fix for check_pkg_test.sh\n\nReplace lines 10-11:\n```bash\noutput_lines=()\nmapfile -t output_lines < <(go list -f '{{.Dir}} - {{.TestGoFiles}} {{.XTestGoFiles}}' ./...)\n```\n\nWith this bash 3.2 compatible version:\n```bash\noutput_lines=()\nwhile IFS= read -r line; do\n    output_lines+=(\"$line\")\ndone < <(go list -f '{{.Dir}} - {{.TestGoFiles}} {{.XTestGoFiles}}' ./...)\n```\n\n### Workaround for GNU Utilities\n\nInstall GNU versions via Homebrew:\nbrew install coreutils gnu-getopt\n\n### Add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bash_profile:\nexport PATH=\"/usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin:$PATH\"\nexport PATH=\"/usr/local/opt/gnu-getopt/bin:$PATH\"\n\n### Testing Help Needed\n\nI don't have access to macOS to test these changes. Could someone please:\n\n1. Test if the modified check_pkg_test.sh works with the change above\n2. Verify if the GNU utilities installation resolves issues with other scripts\n3. Try running make and make run-backend after installing dependencies (the gnu utility, docker etc.)\n4. Report any other script failures and their error messages\n\nOnce confirmed working, we should create a PR with:\n- The script compatibility fix\n- Updates to the main README\n\nAny macOS developers willing to help test? \uD83D\uDE4F\n" ],

      "description" : "### Feature description\r\n\r\nMany of our existing algorithm files have little to no unit testing. This is problematic because this can easily let bugs slip through. We want some assurance that the code we currently have is correct and functional. We welcome all contributors to open PRs to help us add tests to our codebase.\r\n\r\n### How to find low-coverage files\r\n\r\nGo to the Actions tab in this repository and find the most recent **build** workflow run. Open the logs under \"Run Tests\" and scroll down until you find the section on code coverage:\r\n```\r\n---------- coverage: platform linux, python 3.12.0-final-0 -----------\r\nName                                                                          Stmts   Miss  Cover   Missing\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nquantum/q_fourier_transform.py                                                   30     30     0%   14-93\r\nscripts/validate_solutions.py                                                    54     54     0%   2-94\r\nstrings/min_cost_string_conversion.py                                            78     75     4%   20-57, 61-75, 79-129\r\n...\r\n```\r\nThe \"Cover\" column tells you what percentage of the lines in that file are covered by tests. We want to increase this percentage for existing files. Find a file with low coverage percentage that you wish to write tests for, add doctests for each function, and open a PR with your changes. You do not need to have a perfect coverage percentage, but all functions should have doctests.\r\n\r\nSome files will naturally be hard to write tests for. For example, the file may be poorly written because they lack any functions. Other files might be how-tos, meaning they simply demonstrate how to use an existing library's functions rather than implementing the algorithm themselves. Ignore these kinds of files, as they will need to be rewritten eventually. Furthermore, ignore files in the `web_programming` and `project_euler` directories. Web programming files are inherently hard to test and Project Euler files have their own validation workflow, so don't worry about their test coverage.\r\n\r\n_**When you open your PR, put \"Contributes to #9943\" in the PR description.**_ Do not use the word \"fixes\", \"resolves\", or \"closes\". This issue is an ongoing one, and your PR will not single-handedly resolve this issue.\r\n\r\n### How to add doctests\r\n\r\nA doctest is a unit test that is contained within the documentation comment (docstring) for a function. Here is an example of what doctests look like within a docstring:\r\n```py\r\ndef add(a: int, b: int) -> int:\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Adds two non-negative numbers.\r\n    >>> add(1, 1)\r\n    2\r\n    >>> add(2, 5)\r\n    7\r\n    >>> add(1, 0)\r\n    1\r\n    >>> add(-1, -1)\r\n    Traceback (most recent last):\r\n    ...\r\n    ValueError: Numbers must be non-negative\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n```\r\nFor every function in the file you choose, you should write doctests like the ones shown above in its docstring. If a function doesn't have a docstring, add one. Your doctests should be comprehensive but not excessive: you should write just enough tests to cover all basic cases as well as all edge cases (e.g., negative numbers, empty lists, etc).\r\n\r\nDo not simply run a function on some example inputs and put its output as the expected output for a doctest. This assumes that the function is implemented correctly when it might not be. Verify independently that your doctests and their expected outputs are correct. **Your PR will not be merged if it has failing tests.** If you happen to discover a bug while writing doctests, please fix it.\r\n\r\n_**Please read our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before you contribute.**_",

      "comments" : [ "Although it isn't specified in the RFC (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-3.4) many libraries allow passing the same query parameter multiple times, e.g. `somequery?key=3&key=4`. If Seastar doesn't mess this up (e.g., by using a map instead of a list), this can be a way to specify two key components without needing to invent yet another serialization format.\r\n", "According to https://support.datastax.com/s/article/HOW-TO-Specify-composite-partition-keys-for-SSTable-utilities, the colon is expected to work - although this isn't officially specified in the nodetool getendpoints documentation so I'm note sure we should follow this bad advice:\r\n\r\nThe reason why this is a bad syntax is that it makes keys like \"a:b\" ambiguous - is it one component with the \":\" character, or two components? It's not an issue of implementation, it's a bug in nodetool syntax that makes this case ambiguous and nodetool has no idea what the user intended.\r\n\r\n> Since the key is passed over an http-based interface I suggest to allow encoding `:` characters using the standard http encoding as `%3A` substrings (`seastar::http::internal::url_decode` can be used to decode such strings).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if that was your intention, but such encoding (which obviously has to happen when building the REST API URL), will not help to differentiate whether \"a:b\" is two components or one with a colon. Also, if the nodetool API is already ambgious (what does the \"a:b\" the user passed mean?) there is no way that additional encoding can fix it.\r\n\r\nIf you change anything in this area, please don't forget to add tests.", "From the api standpoint what I had in mind is to pass `key=a%3Ab` if the non-composite key (or one of its components) contains `:`.\r\nThe user can pass that to nodetool as well.\r\n\r\nThat said, allowing passing multiple components as request parameters is possible too, though with the current interface it is not intuitive to assume that the multiple key parameters indicate multiple components of a composite key rather than multiple keys, if the API supported returning the natural endpoints for multiple keys.\r\n\r\nNote that `%3A` is supported for `keyspace:table` \"tuples\" when passed as a single parameter or as a comma-separated list of `keyspace:table`, to support keyspace or table names containing `:`.", "> From the api standpoint what I had in mind is to pass `key=a%3Ab` if the non-composite key (or one of its components) contains `:`. The user can pass that to nodetool as well.\r\n\r\n`key=a%3Ab` is the url-encoded form of setting key to `a:b`. But now that Scylla receives it, how does it know if this was intended to be a string key `a:b` or two components?\r\n\r\nMaybe you were thinking of encoding **twice**? If that's the case, the first layer of encoding doesn't need to be URL encoding. Just the outer layer of encoding must be.\r\n\r\nAre you sure about what you said about `keyspace:table` allowing real \":\"? Last time I checked, I found that at least in one context, you are only allowed to have colons in the table name, not keyspace name (e.g., in Alternator GSI), and what happens is simply that Scylla splits only on the first colon, so `xyz:abc:qwe` means that `xyz` is the keyspace, `abc:qwe` is the table. That's a different thing that what you are hoping to do here.", "Can't we use key:\"value:has:colons\"? ", "> Can't we use key:\"value:has:colons\"?\r\n\r\nOf course, that's one way to represent it (with taking care of escaping `\"` characters within the string if needed).\r\nBut we need to be consistent, and the proposal to use %3A to encode column characters is consistent with an http-based REST API.\r\n\r\nIntroducing a new option for composite keys, e.g. `ckey`, that can be given multiple times to build the key is also an elegant option that is consistent with REST API.\r\n\r\nLike @nyh said, we still need to fix the nodetool layer to support composite keys containing `:`.\r\nThere, one could use string quoting or even hex encoding to represent binary key values.", "> Of course, that's one way to represent it (with taking care of escaping `\"` characters within the string if needed). But we need to be consistent, and the proposal to use %3A to encode column characters is consistent with an http-based REST API.\r\n\r\nBut it won't be \"consistent\" - you'll need to run the URL encoding **twice**, which is possible, but not something traditionally done in HTTP. So we gain nothing by making the \"inner\" encoding also another invocation of the URL encoding, it can be something else like quotes or backslashing colons or something. Whatever this inner encoding is, it will need to be documented.\r\n \r\n> Introducing a new option for composite keys, e.g. `ckey`, that can be given multiple times to build the key is also an elegant option that is consistent with REST API.\r\n\r\nYes, this is similar to what I suggested above, although theoretically you don't even need to change the existing option \"key\" if you just allow it to be given multiple times - unless giving a key multiple times has another meaning in the API (maybe an OR of several different keys)? @amnonh would know.\r\n", "> > Of course, that's one way to represent it (with taking care of escaping `\"` characters within the string if needed).

Test in test/rest_api that checks the REST API request in two cases: single-partition-key-column-and-colon-in-the-key and two-partition-key-column-and-colon-used-as-separator. Perhaps we already have a test for the latter case?\n2. Test in dtest or test/nodetool (I'm not up to date on what's right) that checks the nodetool command, not rest api. What we change in the REST API **should** translate also to the nodetool command but it's not obvious that it does and should be tested. Some ideas raised in this issue required even more explicit changes to nodetool that would need to be tested.\n\nPlease also see my recommendation in https://github.com/scylladb/scylladb/pull/24720 to improve the commit message to say exactly what we're fixing and what we aren't, and also consider which documentation we need to update to explain the situation with the colon.\n\n> \n> [@denesb](https://github.com/denesb) should review\n\n", "We should fix for non-singular keys too, otherwise we are just kicking the can down the road.", "> We should fix for non-singular keys too, otherwise we are just kicking the can down the road.\n\nIt's unlikely we can fully resolve this for non-singular (composite) keys, especially when text columns are involved. Regardless of the delimiter used, there's always a risk of collision - either with actual characters in the key or encoded sequences such as `%3A`.\n\nAs for the alternative of specifying the ckey option multiple times (e.g., --ckey=\"part1\" --ckey=\"part2\"), that approach is also problematic. While nodetool might be able to parse such input reliably, we still need to pass it to our API. This would require merging the parts into a single string, which again reintroduces the possibility of ambiguous delimiters or collisions." ],

We need to add more to cover all the code in vllm-ascend, and there are several principles to follow:\n\n1. The overall file tree should be consistent with `vllm_ascend`\n2. The file name should be the original file name with a prefix `test_`\n3. Use `unittest` framework, make good use of mock\n4. The UTs are all running on cpu node, mock the function related to device to host\n\nPlease refer to the official doc on [contributing](https://vllm-ascend.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide/contribution/index.html) and [testing](https://vllm-ascend.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide/contribution/testing.html) to develop, thanks!\n### Unit tests need to add\n\n- [ ] |-- test__version.py\n- [x] |-- test_ascend_config.py\n- [ ] |-- test_attention\n- [ ] |   |-- test_attention.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_attention_v1.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_mla_v1.py\n- [ ] |-- compilation\n- [ ] |   `-- test_piecewise_backend.py\n- [ ] |-- core\n- [ ] |   |-- test_schedule_config.py @nuclearwu\n- [ ] |   `-- test_scheduler.py\n- [ ] |-- device_allocator\n- [ ] |   `-- test_camem.py\n- [ ] |-- distributed\n- [ ] |   |-- test_communicator.py @FieeFlip\n- [ ] |   |-- test_device_communicators @Agonixiaoxiao #1601\n- [ ] |   |   |-- test_pyhccl.py\n- [ ] |   |   `-- test_pyhccl_wrapper.py\n- [x] |   |-- kv_transfer @Agonixiaoxiao \n- [x] |   |   |-- test_simple_buffer.py https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1531\n- [x] |   |   |-- test_simple_connector.py https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1531\n- [x] |   |   |-- test_simple_pipe.py https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1531\n- [ ] |   |   `-- test_utils.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_llmdatadist_connector.py\n- [x] |   `-- test_parallel_state.py   @wangyanhui-cmss https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1460\n- [ ] |-- test_envs.py\n- [ ] |-- lora\n- [ ] |   `-- punica_wrapper @hongfugui\n- [ ] |       `-- test_punica_npu.py @hongfugui\n- [ ] |-- models\n- [ ] |   |-- test_deepseek_dbo.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_deepseek_mtp.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_deepseek_v2.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_qwen2_5_vl.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_qwen2_5_vl_without_padding.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_qwen2_vl.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_qwen3_moe.py\n- [ ] |-- multistream\n- [ ] |   |-- test_base.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_context.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_decorator.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_layers.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_metadata.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_ms_split.py\n- [ ] |-- ops\n- [ ] |   |-- test_activation.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_attention.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_cache.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_common_fused_moe.py\n- [x] |   |-- test_expert_load_balancer.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_fused_moe.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_layernorm.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_rotary_embedding.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_vocab_parallel_embedding.py\n- [ ] |-- patch\n- [ ] |   |-- platform\n- [ ] |   |   |-- patch_0_9_1\n- [ ] |   |   |-- patch_common\n- [ ] |   |   |   `-- test_test_patch_distributed.py\n- [ ] |   |   `-- patch_main\n- [ ] |   `-- worker\n- [ ] |       |-- patch_0_9_1\n- [ ] |       |-- patch_common\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_distributed.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_eagle.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_minicpm.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_multi_step_worker.py\n- [x] |       |   |-- test_patch_sampler.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_spec_decode_worker.py\n- [ ] |       |   `-- test_patch_utils.py\n- [ ] |       `-- patch_main\n- [x] |-- test_platform.py @zhanghw0354 https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1476\n- [ ] |-- quantization\n- [ ] |   |-- test_func_wrapper.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_quant_config.py @nuclearwu\n- [ ] |   |-- test_quantizer.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_w8a8.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_w8a8_dynamic.py\n- [ ] |-- sample\n- [ ] |   |-- ops\n- [ ] |   `-- test_rejection_sampler.py\n- [x] |-- test_utils.py\n- [ ] `-- worker \n- [ ] |-- test_cache_engine.py @machenglong2025\n- [ ] |-- test_draft_model_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_model_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_model_runner_v1.py\n- [ ]  |-- test_mtp_proposer_v1.py @machenglong2025\n- [ ] |-- test_multi_step_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_multi_step_worker.py\n- [ ] |-- test_pooling_model_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_worker.py @zhanghw0354\n- [ ] `-- test_worker_v1.py @zhanghw0354\n",

      "description" : "### Describe the feature or idea you want to propose\n\nwe would like to increase the use of type hints, and a good first issue is to add them for the simplest case when arguments are primitives (int, float, bool) or strings. Pick a package, look through the code and add type hints. Just for primitives for now, more complex types need a bit of thought. Many have npt.ArrayLike types, but we have not decided on standardising on that, so leave these alone. Dont feel you have to do them all, this is a good first issue to get you started. \n\n### Describe your proposed solution\n\nfor example, the constructor for the anomaly detection algorithm STRAY has these type hints\r\n\r\n```\r\n    def __init__(\r\n        self,\r\n        alpha: float = 0.01,\r\n        k: int = 10,\r\n        knn_algorithm: str = \"brute\",\r\n        p: float = 0.5,\r\n        size_threshold: int = 50,\r\n        outlier_tail: str = \"max\",\r\n    ):\r\n ```\r\nbut the segmentation algorithm CLASP does not\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef _is_trivial_match(candidate, change_points, n_timepoints, exclusion_radius=0.05):\r\n    \"\"\"Check if a candidate change point is in close proximity to other change points.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered, if relevant\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

For example:\n```\nX_train : np.ndarray or list of np.ndarray\n        Train data in a 2d or 3d ndarray or list of arrays.\n```\nhere X_train can type hinted as Union, but I think using `ArrayLike` will be user friendly\n\nSimilarly, should I write `random_state: Optional[Union[int, np.random.RandomState, np.random.Generator]]=None`\nas in the parameter `random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None` is given. Or should we simply write `random_state: Optional[int]`. I think in this case we must write the expanded form for support of all random states.", "We do not accept all arraylikes though is my issue with that, only specific formats. If a parameter accepts multiple types you should include them all. Fine to look at other packages and make suggestions based on how they do it if you wish.", "As per the docstring, it is accepting `np.ndarray` or list of `np.ndarray`.\nSo, I think adding `np.ndarray | list[np.ndarray]` will work.\nShould I go forward and make the changes?", "Hi @TonyBagnall  @MatthewMiddlehurst, I'd love to contribute to this issue but I’m still getting familiar with the project.

Which was beneficial when all I wanted was to perform a quick restore (or inspect if restore is even possible).\r\nI mainly used the restore button sub-menu's \"Restore to...\" functionality (which acted as described in the main window \"https://backintime.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mainwindow.html#files-toolbar\").\r\n\r\nWhy was it deemed necessary:\r\nThe main use case was to correct for user mistakes. Be it deletion (using ``rm``, so no trash for me) or accidental overwritten the wrong file.\r\nWhen that happens I usually already was at the filesystem location of interest or could quickly arrive there since most programs allow for \"open file explorer at location from last save\".\r\nFrom there on it was a simple CLI call to backintime or a custom action from the file-explorer. Which was easier to do than opening the backintime main window and navigating to the path of interest.\r\n\r\nThe file-explorer custom action is another benefit of the \"call binary and supply path routine\". This is something a user can \"easily\" implement for it's file-explorer of choice without the need for backintime to supply plugins for multiple known file-explorers.\r\n\r\nHope this explanation is of help.", "Thanks for explaining. You mean you used `$ backintime foobar` (not `backintime-qt`) and then a GUI window came up?", "No problem, after all I did raise the issue :wink:\r\n\r\nFrom a history dive it turned out I was using the following commands (as stored in thunar's `uca.xml`)\r\n```xml\r\n<action>\r\n\t<icon>$someArbitraryIcon</icon>\r\n\t<name>Previous Versions</name>\r\n\t<unique-id>$someUniqueNumber</unique-id>\r\n\t<command>/usr/bin/backintime-qt4 -s %f</command>\r\n\t<description>Restore previous (file) versions using backintime.</description>\r\n\t<patterns>*</patterns>\r\n\t<directories/>\r\n\t<audio-files/>\r\n\t<image-files/>\r\n\t<other-files/>\r\n\t<text-files/>\r\n\t<video-files/>\r\n</action>\r\n<action>\r\n\t<icon>$someArbitraryIcon</icon>\r\n\t<name>Previous Versions (root)</name>\r\n\t<unique-id>$someUniqueNumber</unique-id>\r\n\t<command>pkexec '/usr/bin/backintime-qt4' -s %f</command>\r\n\t<description>Restore previous (file) versions using backintime (as root).</description>\r\n\t<patterns>*</patterns>\r\n\t<directories/>\r\n\t<audio-files/>\r\n\t<image-files/>\r\n\t<other-files/>\r\n\t<text-files/>\r\n\t<video-files/>\r\n</action>\r\n```\r\nWhere `%f` inserts the path to the first selected file/directory.\r\nFor the `pkexec` command I created a custom polkit rule (in case you were wondering why it was there)\r\n", "Thanks for the reply.\r\n\r\nIt is a nice to have feature.

I would give the following ordered list of preference.\n\n1. Don't care which profile, show timestamps from all profiles and only start worrying about a specific profile once a user selected a specific date/timestamp which to inspect further (or restore).\n    * Even if this means 'duplicate' timestamps, although i believe this to be a very rare occurrence given the shown fidelity (image shows seconds).\n3. If the caller (script) did not provide a specific profile use the oldest one (first profile?). Or the main one, in case there exist a concept of profiles with different levels of importance.\n    * This point outsources the responsibility for selecting the correct profile to the system maintainer. Under the assumption that if a maintainer is 'qualified' enough to specify multiple overlapping profiles it becomes their responsibility to maintain 3rd party scripts/callers (the essence of this functionality).\n3. Provide a GUI (or adapt the snapshot one) for selecting the profile to query.\n\nPlease note: This is just a *wish* list, without any regards to the difficulties in coding. No expectations arise from this list (at least from my perspective).", "Thank you very much for your feedback. That helps a lot. With the man page you linked to I had a specific string I could search the git history for.\n\n```\n$ git log -S \"show snapshots dialog for the specified path\"\n\ncommit b2bb84d5b00e2e84a11736cf3ff7d91b57b77f98\nAuthor: Germar <germar.reitze@gmail.com>\nDate:   Sun Jun 9 21:56:34 2013 +0200\n\n    update help and man pages\n\ncommit f19fe9e2121d3123e26b46305b5f8f16a6e5729f\nAuthor: Germar <germar.reitze@gmail.com>\nDate:   Thu Nov 1 23:06:35 2012 +0100\n\n    store plaintext manpages in bazaar\n\n```\nSo related commits might be\n- b2bb84d5b00e2e84a11736cf3ff7d91b57b77f98\n- f19fe9e2121d3123e26b46305b5f8f16a6e5729f\n\nI will take a closer look later.", "OK, I had time to think about it. The \"Snapshots dialog\" will be removed someday and all its features and behavior will somehow be integrated in the main window and its timeline widget.\n\nWith this in mind I would formulate the requested feature like this:\n\n- Open a backup profile in GUI by just specifying a path to a directory or folder contained in the backup source (one of the include-list entries).\n- If multiple profiles containing this path, a) offer a GUI to select one of the profiles and/or b) select the first/oldest profile. The b) behavior could be customizable in the applications (not profile) settings.\n\nOK, this way?\n\nI am not sure how to realize this in the CLI interface. The current/latest CLI looks like this\n\n```\nusage: backintime-qt [-h] [--profile NAME|ID] [--config PATH] [--quiet] [--debug] [-v] [--license] [--diagnostics]\n                     {backup,show,restore,remove,prune,unmount,shutdown,check-config,pw-cache} ...\n\ncommand-line interface (CLI) for Back In Time, to create and manage incremental backups\n\noptions:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  --profile, -p NAME|ID\n                        select profile by name or id\n  --config PATH         read config from PATH (Default: $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/backintime/config)\n  --quiet               be quiet and suppress messages on stdout\n  --debug               increase verbosity\n  -v, --version         show backintime-qt's version number.\n  --license             show backintime-qt's license\n  --diagnostics         show helpful info (in JSON format) for better support in case of issues\n\nCommands:\n  {backup,show,restore,remove,prune,unmount,shutdown,check-config,pw-cache}\n    backup              create new backup, if scheduled and not on battery\n    show                show information about backups\n    restore             restores backup or files or folders from them\n    remove              remove a backup\n    prune               prune backups based on configured \"Remove & Retention\" rules\n    unmount             unmount the profile\n    shutdown            shutdown after backup\n    check-config        check full configuration\n    pw-cache            control Password Cache\n\n  _              ___       ___\n |_)  _.  _ |     |  ._     | o ._ _   _   Version:\n |_) (_| (_ |<   _|_ | |    | | | | | (/_  1.6.0-dev.0927479b\n\n            Project : https://github.com/bit-team/backintime\n        User Manual : https://backintime.readthedocs.io\n          Copyright : see file LICENSES.md\n    Project License : GPL-2.0-or-later\nAdditional Licenses : CC0-1.0, GPL-3.0-or-later, MIT\n```\n\nMaybe this?\n```\n  --profile, -p NAME|ID|PATH\n                        select profile by name or id\n```\n\nI am not totally against it, but I would like to prevent to add a new switch (e.g. `--by-path`).", "Following the discussion I see only two users who are interested in this feature. The discussion is quit old. So I wonder if these user still interested and if there is someone else?\n\nCalculating this I think about to leave it as it is and spare the resources for something else.\n\nAny feedback?", "I'm still interested in opening BIT with a default path selected. But I think a lot of the discussion was about the specific snapshot dialogue, which I personally don't really care about." ],

      "description" : "### \uD83E\uDDED Epic\n\n**Title:** Configurable Connection-Retry Back-off for Database & Redis  \n**Goal:** Prevent gateway startup failures caused by slow-to-start services by making retry limits and intervals fully configurable. \n**Why now:** In containerised deployments Postgres (or any other SQL backend) and Redis often take several seconds to accept TCP connections. Today the gateway gives up on the first failure, crashing with `psycopg2.OperationalError: connection … refused`. Operators need a simple way—via environment variables, just like `DB_POOL_SIZE`, `CACHE_TYPE`, etc.—to tune how many times and how often the gateway retries before aborting.\n\n---\n\n### \uD83E\uDDED Type of Feature\n\n- [x] Enhancement to existing functionality\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDE4B‍♂️ User Story 1\n\n**As a:** DevOps engineer running MCP Gateway in Kubernetes  \n**I want:** to set `DB_MAX_RETRIES` and `DB_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS` for any SQLAlchemy-backed database  \n**So that:** the application patiently waits until the database container is ready, instead of crashing and restarting in a loop\n\n#### ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n```gherkin\nScenario: Database retries during startup\nGiven MCP Gateway starts with DB_MAX_RETRIES=10 and DB_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS=5000\nAnd the database is not yet ready\nWhen the first connection attempt fails\nThen the gateway should log \"DB connection failed (attempt 1/10), retrying in 5 s\"\nAnd it should retry every 5 s\nAnd after 10 failed attempts it should exit with a clear error message\n```\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDE4B‍♂️ User Story 2\n\n**As a:** Site Reliability Engineer using Redis caching  \n**I want:** analogous knobs `REDIS_MAX_RETRIES` and `REDIS_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS`  \n**So that:** the gateway’s cache layer behaves consistently with the database layer\n\n#### ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n```gherkin\nScenario: Redis retries respect custom settings\nGiven REDIS_MAX_RETRIES=15 and REDIS_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS=2000\nAnd Redis is unavailable\nWhen the cache subsystem initialises\nThen it must retry up to 15 times at 2 s intervals\nAnd surface a single aggregated error if all attempts fail\n```\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDE4B‍♂️ User Story 3\n\n**As a:** Platform administrator  \n**I want:** sensible defaults (3 retries × 2000 ms) so I don’t have to set anything for typical installs  \n**So that:** small deployments gain resilience out-of-the-box\n\n#### ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n```\n\nScenario: Defaults work when variables are unset\nGiven none of the four *_RETRIES or *_INTERVAL_MS variables are set\nWhen the gateway cannot reach the database\nThen it retries 3 times with 2 s between attempts\n\n```\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDCD0 Design Sketch (optional)\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\nsubgraph Settings\nENV[\".env / ENV vars\"]\nend\nENV --> Config[config.py load Settings]\nConfig -->|DB config| DBClient[SQLAlchemy Engine]\nConfig -->|Cache config| RedisClient[Redis Async Client]\n\nDBClient --> RetryLogic\nRedisClient --> RetryLogic\n\nRetryLogic{{\"Retry up to N timesnsleep(interval_ms)\"}}\nRetryLogic --> Logger\n```\n\n| Component | Change | Detail |\n|----------|--------|--------|\n| `config.py` | Add four `@env_settings` fields | `db_max_retries:int=3`, `db_retry_interval_ms:int=2000`, `redis_max_retries:int=3`, `redis_retry_interval_ms:int=2000` |\n| `db.py` | Wrap DB connect logic in retry loop | Use `asyncio.sleep()` for interval |\n| Redis cache init | Retry connect with same config | Applies if `CACHE_TYPE=redis` |\n| Logging | One log per retry attempt | Include attempt count and retry delay |\n| README | Add env var docs | Match style of existing DB/Redis config\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDD17 MCP Standards Check\n\n- [x] No protocol-level breaking changes\n- [x] Follows existing env var config conventions\n- [ ] Deviations: none\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDD04 Alternatives Considered\n\n| Alternative | Pros | Cons |\n|------------|------|------|\n| `docker-compose` healthcheck + `depends_on` | Simple for local dev | Doesn’t help bare-metal or k8s |\n| Exponential back-off | Faster in some cases | Adds complexity |\n| Gunicorn retry preload script | Works for some runners | Not general-purpose\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDCD3 Additional Context\n\n- Mirrors retry pattern used in `max_tool_retries`\n- Naming aligned with `DB_POOL_SIZE`, `CACHE_TYPE`, etc.\n- Ensure this is then changed in the helm chart.\n\nExample configuration:\n\n```bash\nexport DB_MAX_RETRIES=10\nexport DB_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS=5000\nexport REDIS_MAX_RETRIES=10\nexport REDIS_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS=5000\n```\n",

      "description" : "### \uD83E\uDDED Epic\n\n**Title:** Test Server Connectivity from Gateway UI  \n**Goal:** Help administrators debug server setup issues by interactively sending custom HTTP requests to configured MCP servers  \n**Why now:** When adding a new MCP server, it's often unclear if a given URL or endpoint is live, secure, or responding as expected. Today, users must use curl/Postman to debug. This feature allows testing any method, path, headers, or body directly from the Gateway UI.\n\n---\n\n### \uD83E\uDDED Type of Feature\n\n- [x] New functionality\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDE4B‍♂️ User Story 1\n\n**As a:** Gateway administrator  \n**I want:** to send custom HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.) to any path on the server I'm configuring  \n**So that:** I can debug connectivity, validate endpoint behavior, and inspect the actual server responses before saving\n\n#### ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n```gherkin\nScenario: Send a custom request to the server before saving\n  Given I am adding a new server in the Gateway UI\n  And I enter a server base URL\n  When I click \"Test Server\"\n  Then I should be able to:\n    - Choose an HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)\n    - Enter a relative path (e.g., /health)\n    - Provide optional headers and request body\n  When I click \"Send\"\n  Then the system sends the request to base_url + path\n  And I should see:\n    - HTTP status code\n    - Total response time (latency)\n    - Response body (pretty-printed JSON if possible)\n```\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDCD0 Design Sketch (optional)\n\n```\n+-------------------- Gateway UI ---------------------+\n| Server URL: https://api.example.com                |\n|                                                    |\n| [ Test Server ] ← opens test panel                 |\n+----------------------------------------------------+\n\n⇣ click\n\n+-------------------- Test Server --------------------+\n| Method: [GET ▼]                                     |\n| Path: /version                                      |\n| Headers (JSON): { \"Authorization\": \"Bearer xyz\" }  |\n| Body (JSON): { \"foo\": \"bar\" } (for POST, PUT...)   |\n| [ Send ]                                            |\n|                                                    |\n| ⇣ Results                                           |\n| ➤ Status: 200 OK                                    |\n| ➤ Latency: 120 ms                                   |\n| ➤ Response:                                         |\n| {                                                   |\n|   \"version\": \"1.0.0\",                               |\n|   \"status\": \"healthy\"                               |\n| }                                                   |\n+-----------------------------------------------------+\n```\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDD17 MCP Standards Check\n\n- [x] No impact on protocol or server discovery logic\n- [x] Safe, diagnostic-only feature\n- [x] Follows existing conventions for JSON and HTTP tooling\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDD04 Alternatives Considered\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons |\n|--------|------|------|\n| Predefined test list (/health, /version) | Simpler UI | Not flexible, less useful for real-world debugging |\n| Silent background ping | No UI work | Less control, can miss issues with specific headers/methods |\n| CLI-only debug tools | No frontend work | Fragments experience, not user-friendly\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDCD3 Additional Context\n\n- This is especially useful when:\n  - Testing authenticated or proxied servers\n  - Verifying custom response structures\n  - Diagnosing CORS or TLS errors from browser context\n- Future enhancements could include:\n  - Copy-as-curl button\n  - History of past test requests\n  - Auto-fill common headers like `Content-Type: application/json`\n",

      "otherNotes" : "This is a known UI limitation: Dify's app list uses infinite scroll (not numbered pagination), loading 30 apps per page as you scroll. If you only see 30 apps, the infinite scroll likely isn't triggering because of a fragile layout—usually due to container height, flex, or overflow settings. The IntersectionObserver that loads more apps only fires if its anchor element is scrolled into view, which won't happen if the scrollable container doesn't fill the viewport or if the anchor isn't pushed down by enough content. This pattern is sensitive to CSS and DOM structure changes and has caused similar issues elsewhere in the codebase.",

The problem is in the `crud_controller.go` file where readonly fields are using the HTML `readonly` attribute instead of the `disabled` attribute.\n\n#### **Current Implementation Issues:**\n\n**All field types are affected:**\n- **String fields** (lines 1257-1259, 1240-1242): Uses `readonly` attribute\n- **Int fields** (lines 1293-1295): Uses `readonly` attribute  \n- **Bool fields** (lines 1322-1324): Uses `readonly` attribute\n- **Float fields** (lines 1360-1362): Uses `readonly` attribute\n- **Date fields** (lines 1391-1393): Uses `readonly` attribute\n- **UUID fields** (lines 1458-1460): Uses `readonly` attribute\n- **Timestamp fields** (lines 1481-1483): Uses `readonly` attribute\n- **Decimal fields** (lines 1528-1530): Uses `readonly` attribute\n- **Select fields** (lines 1617-1619, 1638-1640, 1660-1662): Uses `readonly` attribute\n\n#### **Root Cause:**\nThe difference between HTML attributes:\n- `readonly`: Field is non-editable but still focusable and interactive\n- `disabled`: Field is completely non-interactive and truly disabled\n\nSince the crud controller already excludes readonly fields from form processing, the intention is that these fields should be completely disabled from user interaction.\n\n### **Implementation Plan**\n\n#### **Step 1: Update Field Rendering Logic**\n**File:** `/home/runner/_work/iota-sdk/iota-sdk/modules/core/presentation/controllers/crud_controller.go`\n\nReplace all occurrences of:\n```go\nif field.Readonly() {\n    builder = builder.Attrs(templ.Attributes{\"readonly\": true})\n}\n```\n\nWith:\n```go\nif field.Readonly() {\n    builder = builder.Attrs(templ.Attributes{\"disabled\": true})\n}\n```\n\n**Lines to update:**\n- Line 1241: Textarea readonly handling\n- Line 1258: Text input readonly handling  \n- Line 1294: Number input readonly handling\n- Line 1323: Checkbox readonly handling\n- Line 1361: Float input readonly handling\n- Line 1392: Date input readonly handling\n- Line 1459: UUID input readonly handling\n- Line 1482: Timestamp input readonly handling\n- Line 1529: Decimal input readonly handling\n- Line 1618: Static select readonly handling\n- Line 1639: Searchable select readonly handling\n- Line 1661: Combobox select readonly handling\n\n#### **Step 2: Test Field Behavior**\n- Create test cases to verify readonly fields are properly disabled\n- Test form submission to ensure disabled fields don't interfere\n- Verify visual appearance meets expectations\n\n#### **Step 3: Consider CSS Styling**\n- Ensure disabled fields have appropriate visual styling\n- Check that form components handle `disabled` attribute correctly\n\n#### **Step 4: Update Documentation**\n- Update any relevant documentation about readonly field behavior\n- Consider adding comments about the disabled vs readonly choice\n\n---\n\n**Expected Outcome:**\nFields marked with `readonly: true` will render as `disabled` inputs, making them completely non-interactive while still visible for reference.\n\n### **Summary**\n\nThe issue affects **12 specific lines** across all field types in the crud controller. The fix is straightforward: replace `readonly` with `disabled` in the HTML attributes. This change aligns with the expected behavior where readonly fields should be completely non-interactive rather than just non-editable.\n\nThe implementation is ready to proceed with the identified changes.\n\n---" ],

Forked and cloned the repository, then searched the codebase for `readline` usage to find the core input handling logic.\n2.  Identified `useKeypress.ts` (for raw keypress events) and `InputPrompt.tsx` (for input logic) as the key files.\n3.  To see what the application receives, I temporarily modified the code to log every keypress event to a `debug.log` file.\n4.  **Key Finding:** My initial debugging proved that on a default macOS Terminal, `Shift+Enter` sends the exact same sequence (`\\r`) as a regular `Enter` press, making the two indistinguishable.\n\n### Attempted Fix & The Final Discovery\n\nBased on the initial finding, I attempted a code-only fix by teaching the application to listen for a different key combination, `Shift+Down`, which often sends a unique sequence on other terminals.\n\n1. The Code I Tested\nI modified `useKeypress.ts` to listen for the `Shift+Down` sequence (`\\x1b[1;2B`) and `InputPrompt.tsx` to handle a `key.shift` flag.\n\n```typescript\n// In useKeypress.ts, I added a check:\nif (key.sequence === '\\x1b[1;2B') {\n  key.name = 'return';\n  key.shift = true;\n}\n```\n```typescript\n// In InputPrompt.tsx, I added the key.shift check:\nif (key.ctrl || key.meta || key.shift || charBefore === '\\\\' || key.paste) {\n  // ... newline logic\n}\n```\n\n2. The Result: It Also Failed\nThis proof-of-concept did not work. To understand why, I used the `cat` command to see what my terminal was actually sending when I pressed `Shift+Down`.\nFinal Proof: The terminal sent `^[[B`, which is the standard escape code for a plain Cursor Down key.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis investigation leads to a definitive conclusion: the default macOS Terminal is more limited than anticipated. It appears to strip the `Shift` modifier information from both the `Enter` key and the arrow keys, making a code-only fix for a `Shift+Key` newline combination unfeasible on this specific platform, although i think this might work on other platforms which by default register shift + down as '\\x1b[1;2B' but i cant really test it.\n\nThis might explain why `Ctrl+J` is a common suggested alternative, as it sends a universal newline character (`\\n`) that doesn't rely on modifier key parsing.\n\nAs this is my first contribution, my analysis could be wrong, and I apologize for the detailed-but-failed attempt. Given these findings, what is the desired path forward? Any information from the internal `b.corp.google.com` link about how other terminals are supported would still be very helpful.\n\nThank you for your time and guidance.", "Just to add, I personally use the Warp Terminal on Mac.

Specifically, inside `DagFileProcessor._execute_dag_callbacks`, the following code fails:\n`dag = dagbag.dags[request.dag_id]  # returns empty\n`\n\nThis happens because `dagbag.process_file()` cannot find the DAG file at the specified path (versions/<commit_hash>/...), and so the DAG is never loaded, and the callback is silently skipped.\n\n### What you think should happen instead\n\nThe DAG Processor should also materialize the correct version of the DAG source code (i.e., clone the Git repository to the appropriate `versions/<commit_hash>` path) before attempting to load and execute DAG-level callbacks.\n\n\n\n### How to reproduce\n\n1. Use GitDagBundle with supports_versioning=True.\n2. Define a DAG-level `on_failure_callback` or `on_success_callback`.\n3. Deploy a new Git version and trigger a DAG run that invokes the callback.\n4. The DAG tasks execute successfully.\n5. But DAG callback fails because the path in the callback request is under versions/<commit_hash>/, which is not materialized\n6. As a workaround, we patched GitDagBundle.refresh() to also clone the repo into the `versions/` directory.\n\n### Anything else\n\nIn our environment, DAGs are triggered via Asset, but this should not affect the behavior.\n\n### Are you willing to submit PR?\n\n- [x] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n",

This is the preventing policy:\n\n```\n  statement {\n    actions = [\"ec2:CreateTags\"]\n\n    resources = [\n      \"arn:${local.partition}:ec2:*:*:volume/*\",\n      \"arn:${local.partition}:ec2:*:*:snapshot/*\",\n    ]\n\n    condition {\n      test     = \"StringEquals\"\n      variable = \"ec2:CreateAction\"\n      values = [\n        \"CreateVolume\",\n        \"CreateSnapshot\",\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nSo the condition only permits creating tags on CreateAction while DeleteTags does not implement any condition.\n\nIf your request is for a new feature, please use the `Feature request` template.\n\n- [X] ✋ I have searched the open/closed issues and my issue is not listed.\n\n## Versions\n\n- Module version [Required]:\n5.54.0\n- Terraform version:\n1.11.4\n- Provider version(s):\nv5.83.0\n\n## Reproduction Code [Required]\n\nkubectl apply -f manifests/pod-with-volume.yaml\nkubectl apply -f manifests/volumeattributesclass.yaml\n\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n\n1. Create a VAC for which a tag is specified which will be created on the EBS volume\n2. Set the volume attribute class on a PVC\n3. EBS CSI volume fails with error:\n\n`\"Error from AWS API\" err=\"api error UnauthorizedOperation: You are not authorized to perform this operation.

      "description" : "### Current Behavior\r\nCurrently for new users we do not have enough starter templates that they can use as introductory material.\r\n\r\n### Desired Behavior\r\nWe want to create a Design Critique template to allow new users to understand how they can create a Design Critique diagram with Kanvas. So we'd want contributors to not just create a design template but also add tips or notes they think a new user would need if they are starting out with little to no context of the capabilities Kanvas offers.\r\n\r\n### Implementation\r\nMake sure you use [Kanvas](https://kanvas.new/extension/meshmap) to create this template and keep the template private.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Provide a brief overview of what this template does and can help with, maybe highlight a usecase\r\n- [ ] Add a template that can be directly copied and used instantaneously\r\n- [ ] Add a step by step process to create this template\r\n- [ ]  Once the design is completed, publish it and share the private link with our team, or tag us in the comment component to receive feedback.\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Tests\r\n- Template has been submitted for publishing to the catalog and accepted; is published and available in the Meshery Catalog.\r\n- We are in need of well annotated and described templates like [this](https://playground.meshery.io/extension/meshmap?mode=design&design=ad9ec213-4e28-4cda-ba60-042b270ca0c3) one.\r\n### Mockups\r\nThis [FigJam](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1085289819681923775) template can be used for recreating the Design Critique Template\r\n\r\n### Perks\r\nBy contributing to this task, your efforts will have a lasting impact! Once published, your design will be cloned and used by countless users as a go-to starting point for creatingDesign Critique in Kanvas. You'll not only help newcomers understand the platform but also see your work adopted widely by the community. Plus, as a token of appreciation, you'll receive a special shoutout, recognising your valuable contribution. Your effort won’t go unnoticed—you're directly helping shape the experience for future users!\r\n\r\n---\r\n### Contributor [Guides](https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing) and [Handbook](https://layer5.io/community/handbook)\r\n- \uD83D\uDEE0 [Meshery Build & Release Strategy](https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/build-and-release)\r\n- \uD83D\uDCDA [Instructions for contributing to documentation](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#documentation-contribution-flow)\r\n   - Meshery documentation [site](https://docs.meshery.io/) and [source](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/tree/master/docs)\r\n- \uD83C\uDFA8 Wireframes and designs for Meshery UI in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/SMP3zxOjZztdOLtgN4dS2W/Meshery-UI)\r\n- \uD83D\uDE4B\uD83C\uDFFE\uD83D\uDE4B\uD83C\uDFFC Questions: [Discussion Forum](http://discuss.meshery.io) and [Community Slack](https://slack.meshery.io)\r\n",

      "description" : "### Steps to reproduce\n\nUse the code below or try dartpad:\n[https://dartpad.dev/?id=06c010125e651e2bfadeecbff2db181a](https://dartpad.dev/?id=06c010125e651e2bfadeecbff2db181a)\nI tested it on the main branch and on the stable one.\n\n### Expected results\n\n`PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber` should return actual frame number on the Web, just like on other platforms.\n\n### Actual results\n\nOn the web `PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber` returns always -1.\nI have tested the code below on the desktop (Windows) and it returns the correct ascending frame numbers. But on the web (via `flutter run -d chrome` or dartpad) this method always returns -1.\nI also found two strange behaviors (potential bugs?).\n1. `frameNumber` has the old value until the end of the transientCallbacks phase. If this is not a bug, it should be documented. The picture below shows a different number in different callbacks during a frame. (underlined in blue)\n2.  `scheduleMicrotask` method calls its callback after the frame ends on the web, and not between `onBeginFrame` and `onDrawFrame` as expected (underlined in red). On the desktop (Windows) it works correctly.\n\n### Code sample\n\n<details open><summary>Code sample</summary>\n\n```dart\nimport 'dart:async';\nimport 'dart:ui';\n\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:flutter/scheduler.dart' show SchedulerBinding, Ticker;\n\nvoid main() {\n  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();\n\n  // ignore: invalid_use_of_protected_member\n  SchedulerBinding.instance.ensureFrameCallbacksRegistered();\n\n  final onBeginFrame = PlatformDispatcher.instance.onBeginFrame;\n  final onDrawFrame = PlatformDispatcher.instance.onDrawFrame;\n\n  PlatformDispatcher.instance.onBeginFrame = (Duration elapsed) {\n    print('+' * 30);\n    final frameNumber = PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber;\n    print('frameNumber from onBeginFrame callback: $frameNumber');\n    onBeginFrame!(elapsed);\n    print('___finish onBeginFrame');\n  };\n\n  PlatformDispatcher.instance.onDrawFrame = () {\n    print('___start onDrawFrame');\n    onDrawFrame!();\n    final frameNumber = PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber;\n    print('frameNumber from onDrawFrame callback: $frameNumber');\n    print('-' * 30);\n  };\n\n  runApp(const App());\n}\n\nclass App extends StatelessWidget {\n  const App({super.key});\n\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return const MaterialApp(debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false, home: Home());\n  }\n}\n\nclass Home extends StatefulWidget {\n  const Home({super.key});\n\n  @override\n  State<Home> createState() => _HomeState();\n}\n\nclass _HomeState extends State<Home> with TickerProviderStateMixin {\n  Ticker? ticker;\n\n  @override\n  void initState() {\n    super.initState();\n\n    SchedulerBinding.instance.addPersistentFrameCallback((_) {\n      final frameNumber = PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber;\n      print('frameNumber from the persistent callback: $frameNumber');\n    });\n\n    ticker = createTicker((_) {\n      final frameNumber = PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber;\n      print('frameNumber from the transient callback: $frameNumber');\n      scheduleMicrotask(() {\n        final frameNumber = PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber;\n        print('frameNumber from the microtask callback: $frameNumber');\n      });\n      SchedulerBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback((_) {\n        final frameNumber = PlatformDispatcher.instance.frameData.frameNumber;\n        print('frameNumber from the postframe callback: $frameNumber');\n      });\n    })..start();\n\n    Timer(const Duration(seconds: 1), () {\n      ticker?.dispose();\n      ticker = null;\n    });\n  }\n\n  @override\n  void dispose() {\n    ticker?.dispose();\n    super.dispose();\n  }\n\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return const Placeholder();\n  }\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Screenshots or Video\n\n<details open>\n<summary>Screenshots / Video demonstration</summary>\n\nOn the desktop:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abca8f1d-4d88-4d5a-988e-974c58d0052e)\n\nOn the web:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fcfb6c2-ea1e-4c92-b62f-d7a800e01791)\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Logs\n\n\n\n\n### Flutter Doctor output\n\n<details open><summary>Doctor output</summary>\n\n```console\n[√] Flutter (Channel main, 3.33.0-1.0.pre.619, on Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.19045.5965], locale ru-RU)\n[√] Windows Version (Њ ©Єа®б®дв Windows 10 Pro 64-а §ап¤­ п, 22H2, 2009)\n[√] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 34.0.0)\n[√] Chrome - develop for the web\n[√] Visual Studio - develop Windows apps (Visual Studio Build Tools 2022 17.6.5)\n[√] Android Studio (version 2022.2)\n[√] VS Code (version 1.101.1)\n[√] Connected device (4 available)\n[√] Network resources\n\n• No issues found!\n```\n\n</details>\n",

The User Stories should follow this pattern:-->\r\nAs a app user I want know if at a poi my language is spoken so that I know if it is worth for me to go there.\r\n\r\n### Additional Context\r\n<!-- Add any other information or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\r\nSee: https://openproject.tuerantuer.org/projects/community-feedback/work_packages/3231/activity\r\n\r\n### Design Requirements\r\n<!-- If the customization includes input from our design team, the detailed requirements will be collected here.

      "description" : "Part of #12048\n\n## Issue\nAfter most of the Unit Test migration in #12048, there are a lot of inconsistencies in access control test methods. This is because we did not migrate the many convenient, abstracted, and commonly used access control test methods from `ui/webapi/BaseActionTest.java` to `sqlui/webapi/BaseActionTest.java`.\n\nAfter merging #13254, all of the access control test methods in `BaseActionTest.java` have been migrated. Hence, this issue aims to refactor the unit test access controls to use these convenient test methods.\n\n## Progress\nThe progress for this refactoring can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IcB-viJMrIOknYoBYasBuRBK9qnwY0-doEK4_Eb24IA/edit?gid=0#gid=0). I (the author) will update it when completed PRs are merged proactively.\n\n## Steps to Contribute\n\n1. Choose test(s) to work on in the above Google Sheets link\n2. Check that no on else have claimed the test cases to work on within the last 2 weeks, or that it has been completed by follow up PRs (but not updated in the sheets)\n3. Comment on this issue to indicate that you'd like to contribute on the chosen test(s). Update your comment if you need more than 2 weeks so that other contributors don't overlap with your work.\n4. Create a PR to refactor the unit test(s).\n5. Submit the PR, with a link to this issue by starting the description with \"Part of #13304\"## Tips\n\n- Understand the access control test methods in `sqlui/webapi/BaseActionTest.java`, follow the refactoring in #13254\n- Most of the access control testing logic in the migrated unit tests under `sqlui/webapi` follows the old unit tests under `ui/webapi`, so you may wish to reference the old unit test for help",

      "repositoryName" : "elizaOS/eliza",
      "description" : "# Migrate remaining CLI input methods to use @clack/prompts for consistency\n\n## \uD83C\uDFAF Summary\n\nCurrently, the CLI uses a mix of input libraries (`inquirer`, Bun's global `prompt()`, and `@clack/prompts`). We should standardize on `@clack/prompts` for a consistent user experience and better styling across all CLI interactions.\n\n## \uD83D\uDCCB Current State\n\nMost of the CLI already uses `@clack/prompts` properly, but there are **2 main files** still using other input methods:\n\n### 1. `src/utils/plugin-creator.ts` - Using `inquirer` \uD83D\uDCE6\n\nThis file has multiple `inquirer.prompt()` calls that need to be migrated:\n\n- **Plugin specification collection** (~line 172-290):\n  - Plugin name input\n  - Plugin description input  \n  - Plugin features input\n  - Component selection (checkbox)\n  - Action names input\n  - Provider names input\n  - Evaluator names input\n  - Service names input\n\n### 2. `scripts/generate-unit-tests.ts` - Using global `prompt()` \uD83D\uDD27\n\n- **Test generation confirmation** (~line 165):\n  ```typescript\n  const answer = prompt('Generate tests? (y/n): ');\n  ```\n\n## ✨ Benefits of Migration\n\n1. **Consistent UX** - All CLI interactions will have the same look and feel\n2. **Better styling** - Clack provides superior visual design and animations\n3. **Better error handling** - Clack has built-in cancellation handling\n4. **Reduced dependencies** - Can remove `inquirer` from package.json\n5. **Type safety** - Better TypeScript integration\n\n## \uD83D\uDD27 Implementation Examples\n\n### For `plugin-creator.ts`:\n\n**Before (inquirer):**\n```typescript\nconst answers = await inquirer.prompt([\n  {\n    type: 'input',\n    name: 'name',\n    message: 'Plugin name (without \"plugin-\" prefix):',\n    validate: (input: string) => input.length > 0 || 'Plugin name is required'\n  }\n]);\n```\n\n**After (clack):**\n```typescript\nconst name = await clack.text({\n  message: 'Plugin name (without \"plugin-\" prefix):',\n  validate: (input) => input.length > 0 ? undefined : 'Plugin name is required'\n});\n\nif (clack.isCancel(name)) {\n  clack.cancel('Operation cancelled.');\n  process.exit(0);\n}\n```\n\n### For `generate-unit-tests.ts`:\n\n**Before:**\n```typescript\nconst answer = prompt('Generate tests? (y/n): ');\n```\n\n**After:**\n```typescript\nconst answer = await clack.confirm({\n  message: 'Generate tests?',\n  initialValue: true\n});\n\nif (clack.isCancel(answer)) {\n  console.log('Cancelled.');\n  return;\n}\n```\n\n## ✅ Reference Files (Already Using Clack)\n\nThese files are already properly implemented and serve as good examples:\n- `src/commands/create/actions/creators.ts`\n- `src/commands/create/index.ts`\n- `src/commands/env/actions/edit.ts`\n- `src/commands/publish/utils/validation.ts`\n- `src/utils/cli-prompts.ts`\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Replace all `inquirer.prompt()` calls in `plugin-creator.ts` with clack equivalents\n- [ ] Replace global `prompt()` call in `generate-unit-tests.ts` with clack\n- [ ] Remove `inquirer` dependency from `package.json` if no longer used elsewhere\n- [ ] Ensure all prompts handle cancellation properly (ctrl+c)\n- [ ] Test plugin creation flow works identically to current behavior\n- [ ] Test unit test generation script works identically to current behavior\n- [ ] Maintain existing validation logic and error messages\n- [ ] Update any related TypeScript types if needed\n\n## \uD83C\uDFAF Priority\n\n**Medium** - This improves developer experience and code consistency but doesn't affect core functionality.\n\n## \uD83D\uDCA1 Implementation Notes\n\n- The `generate-unit-tests.ts` part would be a good **beginner-friendly** task\n- The `plugin-creator.ts` part is more complex due to multiple sequential prompts\n- Consider breaking this into two separate PRs if needed\n- Make sure to test the checkbox selection for component types in plugin creation\n\n---\n\n**Note**: The majority of the CLI already uses clack properly - this is just cleaning up the last few stragglers to ensure complete consistency across the entire CLI experience.",

It seems that changed part only add a wrapper \"ArrayFileSegment\" of return files. I doubt if this will change the answer of my custom tag.", "<!-- Answer -->\nYou're correct—adding the ArrayFileSegment wrapper only affects how file outputs are handled and does not impact string outputs or the formatting of your custom tags in the answer node. The regression with your custom tag is more likely due to changes in how the answer node parses and merges templates and variables. Specifically, the answer is now assembled by splitting your template into text and variable chunks, then merging them, which can cause issues if the chunk boundaries don't align with your tags (for example, if you have a template like `<tag>{{#llm#}}</tag>`) [[source]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/blob/37e19de7ab3d8c1ffd8dfd8b789ff52b47f981cb/api/core/workflow/nodes/answer/answer_stream_generate_router.py).\n\nIf your tags are ending up empty, it's likely because the variable replacement logic is splitting the template in a way that separates the tag from the variable. This is unrelated to ArrayFileSegment and is instead a subtle change in the template parsing or merging logic. You might be able to work around this by adjusting your template so that the variable is not directly inside the tag, or by experimenting with different placements of your tags and variables. If you need to dig deeper, reviewing the logic in AnswerStreamGeneratorRouter and the template parsers (PromptTemplateParser, VariableTemplateParser) will show exactly how the chunks are split and merged.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

The frontend now uses a custom Rehype plugin that strips or alters any HTML tag that doesn't match the regex /^[a-z][a-z0-9]*$/i, converting it to plain text. This means custom tags (like `<tag>`) are no longer rendered as HTML elements, which is why your LLM output appears outside the tag or the tag appears empty in the UI, even though the backend (and debug panel) output is correct. This stricter sanitation was likely added for security reasons and is not documented as a breaking change, so it may not have been present or as strict in 1.4.3 [reference](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/blob/37e19de7ab3d8c1ffd8dfd8b789ff52b47f981cb/web/app/components/base/markdown/index.tsx).\n\nTo work around this, you can use only standard HTML tags supported by the renderer, or adjust your template to avoid custom tags. If you need custom tag support, you would need to patch the frontend markdown renderer to relax or remove this restriction.

build lib_lightgbm (just do this once)\ncmake -B build -S .\ncmake --build build --target _lightgbm -j4\n\n# install Python package (do this every time you change Python code in the library)\nsh build-python.sh install --precompile\n\n# run tests\npython tests/test_python_package\n```\n\nHow to run the R tests:\n\n```shell\nsh build-cran-package.sh --no-build-vignettes\nR CMD INSTALL ./lightgbm*.tar.gz\ncd ./R-package/tests\nRscript testthat.R\n```\n\nFor other questions on how to set up your development environment, see #6350 (and post questions there about the development process).",

There are just a few more of these left, could you help us finish this?", "@jameslamb sure thing, all of these appear to be fixed except for the final `raises` in `test_dask.py`, which I've just opened a PR for. To help add the corr. PR in the issue [OP](https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/issues/6860#issue-2908975971) to the remaining unchecked `raises` by file:\n\n- `test_basic.py`\n   - Remaining `raises`: https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/pull/6893\n- `test_dask.py`\n   - First two `raises`: https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/pull/6893\n   - Last `raises`: https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/pull/6955\n- `test_sklearn.py`\n   - All `raises`: https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/pull/6929\n\nAlso to enforce error messages when testing for errors in the future I believe we can:\n\n- Python package: Add [ruff's `PT011`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/pytest-raises-too-broad/) to the `pyproject.toml` file\n   - Alternatively, we could enforce the entire [flake8-pytest-style (`PT`)](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/#flake8-pytest-style-pt) collection of linters, though there are currently 27 related errors so if we want to enforce this we'd have to do a little work before updating the linting config for the sake of CI checks (please see \"All PT Errors\" below). Plus, some of these are naturally subjective styling so not sure if we necessarily want to enforce them.\n- R package: Keeping track of adding this linter to `lintr` in https://github.com/r-lib/lintr/issues/2870\n   - Doesn't currently exist for [`testthat` linters](https://lintr.r-lib.org/reference/pkg_testthat_linters.html)\n   - If maintainers deem useful, I can add that in to `lintr` and afterwards update in this project and add that to the list of R linters we use\n\nSo please let me know if you'd like me to make the immediate proposed change to the python linting config (adding `PT011`) and if so, if you'd like me to do it as part of this issue or open up a separate issue.\n\n<details><summary>All PT

I apologize, looks like I was not doing as good a job of keeping the list in the description up to date as I thought.

I love the idea of introducing `ruff`'s `PT011` to help enforce this stuff, and I'd support just immediately doing that (no need to create a new issue).\n\nLooks like it even caught one overly-broad exception that I missed in this issue:\n\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/blob/e7c6c4371b5d725902a09a80b4d6c36e432a4381/tests/python_package_test/test_dask.py#L1233\n\nI'd support PRs (or even a single PR, if you'd prefer) that introduced `PT` in the list here:\n\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/blob/e7c6c4371b5d725902a09a80b4d6c36e432a4381/python-package/pyproject.toml#L141\n\nThese look like some great suggestions... for example, only putting `with pytest.raises()` around the 1 statement that raises the exception is really helpful, and something @StrikerRUS has advised me on before. Would be great to enforce that automatically!\n\nBut please add the following to the `ignore` list\n\n* \"PT007 Wrong values type in `pytest.mark.parametrize` expected `list` of `tuple`\"\n  - *I do not really understand this one... a `tuple` is a little safer because it's immutable*\n* \"PT003 `scope='function'` is implied in `@pytest.fixture()`\"\n  - *I like being able to read the code and knowing it's a function-scoped fixture, not needing to remember what the default is*\n\n> _I can add that in to lintr and afterwards update in this project and add that to the list of R linters we use_\n\nThanks for opening that `{lintr}` issue.\n\nIf that idea is accepted and implemented there, I'd support using it here in LightGBM. I understand and agree with some of the concerns @MichaelChirico raised there, but for `{lightgbm}` (where our `expect_error()` tests are mostly catching our own first-party error messages), I'd like this linter's help and I'd be willing to to pay the slight maintenance cost of `# nolint` comments on any `expect_error()` calls catching errors raised by other libraries.\n\nTotally up to you if working on that in `{lintr}` interests you!", "@jameslamb Sounds good! I've opened up a PR to add \"PT\" to our linting config in #6959.\n\nI intend to work on the `lintr` issue, though I've chosen to automatically close this issue once #6959 is merged, since getting the R linter into `lintr` and having it be released in a new version so we can bump the `lintr` version in this project and use it will likely take some time, so I imagine we could specifically track that in a new issue.\n\nIf you'd instead prefer to keep this existing issue open to track the R linting config changes, just let me know!", "Thanks!\n\nYeah let's let #6959 close this issue. No need to create a new issue here for the `{lintr}` stuff, since that isn't even guaranteed to be merged... It would be ok with me if you just open a PR here in the future introducing the new linter(s) and bumping the version, similar to https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/pull/6471" ],

Please describe.**\nInfinistore supports Ethernet and Infiniband, but LMCache hard-codes the link type to Ethernet when setting up its Infinistore connection. This limits the usefulness of the Infinistore backend.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nI would like to add a configuration parameter (maybe `infinistore_link` or `infinistore_link_type`) that allows choosing Ethernet or Infiniband at runtime.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nCurrently I work around this by editing the hard-coded link type value. This is not a great solution for folks who are not building from source.\n\n**Additional context**\nI am happy to make this change if maintainers agree it should be made.\n",

This option is a type string.\r\nhttps://registry.terraform.io/providers/elastic/elasticstack/latest/docs/resources/fleet_integration\r\n\r\nQuestions are:  1) Could an value of \"latest\" or some other string be used in place of a specific numbered version to 'enable' terraform to Keep the integration(s) up to date?  2)  Could the Fleet API with 'keepPoliciesUpToDate' option be used to set/enable all integrations across the board to be kept update to date automatically?  3)  Is it advisable to try this or would there be any known or unintended consequences that might occur thereby making it something not to do or attempt?\r\n\r\nIt seems that since some of the integrations have the keep up to date feature and some do not, that there is a reason that not all integrations already have this Fleet UI toggle button.\r\n",

      "comments" : [ "+1 - we just ran into a problem related the fleet integrations when upgrading our entire stack from 8.15 -> 8.18\n\nI think because of the \"auto update\", the apm server integration got upgraded to 8.18 automatically, this broke our terraform state because it couldn't find the apm server integration 8.15.\n\nWe had to manipulate state to remove it, then found out that `terrafom import` is not supported for this resource type, so we had to manually go in kibana and delete the integration, so then terraform was able to proceed and create it.\n\nThis is really cumbersome\nIt's the first time we've ran into this because it's the first upgrade after we introduced terraform to manage our elastic stack.\n", "Plus, I'm wondering if it's even worth to have the integrations controlled by terraform, because when you bump the version, terraform tries to remove the integration and add a new one, but this fails because you cannot remove integrations that have a policy assigned to it.\n\nThis really breaks the whole point of automating this.\nAs a paying customer, I'm really disappointed that the terraform provider just seem like an afterthought, and there is really no other good alternative to maintain a bunch of elastic/kibana internal resources through IaC ", "It is a reasonable question to be asked, if it does make sense to manage the fleet integrations with Terraform. We do it for one of our setups since roughly 9 months and there are some challenges attached to it. The main reason we still do it is, that it helps us to keep everything under control between the 3 deployments (dev, test, prod).\n\nWhat we find challenging is to perform updates of the fleet integrations. We normally execute the update manually on dev and then \"backport\" the changes to Terraform by analyzing the differences in the execution plan. The main challenge there is rooted in the fact, that some of the properties (for example `vars`, if I recall correctly) are marked as sensitive in Terraform and therefore Terraform refuses to show the differences even if the property might not contain any sensitive value for some of the fleet integrations (where others actually do store sensitive values in this property). Since analyzing the differences in the JSON output of the Terraform plan became very painful (especially, since the values are JSON in JSON), we even built our own tool to assist with this (https://github.com/breml/tfreveal).\n\nThe bottom line is, that with the use of fleet integrations one faces the challange, that there are two different systems (Terraform and the install/update mechanism of Fleet), which change the state and therefore there is always drift, that one needs to handle in Terraform. Sofar we made it work, but compared with other systems, that we manage with Terraform, this is for sure one of the more painful ones." ],

The trade-off being higher confidence we have no flakes.\n\nI  think we can keep local test runs (by default) to continue to run with `-count=1` (the default) ie. `make unit-test`. And so no changes for local dev.\n\nBut given the frequency of flakey test runs, I do think it is worth it to run CI with `-count=2`. It will slow CI down, but flakey/buggy tests will likely fail checks. And if we have access to bigger build workers(?), I think that would help reduce the time (bigger workers = more CPUs = more tests running in parallel).\n\n(ill put this comment on https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/31013#pullrequestreview-2975837738 as well)\n\nThe final option would be to only run with a higher count upon merging to main.

During the first stage of training, the strong information bottleneck created by the VQ-VAE codebook forces the learned latent actions to capture only the information not inferable from task instructions—resulting in task-irrelevant latent actions.\n\nIn the second stage, with these task-irrelevant latents frozen, the newly initialized latent actions are trained to replace the role of language, allowing them to learn task-centric dynamics.\n\nThis also explains why, in naive latent action learning approaches like LAPA and Genie, latent action tokens mostly encode motion/dynamics—since texture information is already preserved from previous frames for future frame prediction in the decoder. ", "If your goal is to learn task-relevant tokens, why not directly use contrastive learning to encode those tokens and perform a soft alignment with the text instruction features?

It seems like a more straightforward way to achieve your objective.\n", "@retsuh-bqw Thanks for your detailed explanation.\n\nTo support your claims, I think it would be helpful to demonstrate what kind of behavior the latent actions actually exhibit.

Have you tried this approach? It seems like a more straightforward way to achieve your objective.\n\n@dreamcubeblock We haven't tried this approach yet, but here's our reasoning: During a task episode, the latent action should evolve over time while the language instruction remains the same. Explicit contrastive alignment could harm convergence in this case, as it may be more suitable for learning latent actions that represent the entire task rollout rather than individual steps.", "> [@retsuh-bqw](https://github.com/retsuh-bqw) Thanks for your detailed explanation.\n> \n> To support your claims, I think it would be helpful to demonstrate what kind of behavior the latent actions actually exhibit.

While we cannot perform explicit reconstruction (since LAM operates in DINO space rather than raw pixels), we have conducted related analyses:\n\n- Figures 8 & A-1 demonstrate that latent actions exhibit semantic consistency across environments and embodiments.\n\n- Figure A-3 explores the attention patterns between latent actions and DINO features." ],

      "description" : "**1. Overview:**\n\nEnsure robust and up-to-date integration of the OpenAI API as a core LLM provider within the `voltagent` framework, utilizing the official `openai` Node.js SDK. This involves verifying support for the latest OpenAI models (GPT-4, GPT-3.5 variants), features (like tool calling, JSON mode), and ensuring the implementation aligns perfectly with the `LLMProvider` interface and `voltagent` conventions.\n\n**2. Goals:**\n\n*   Implement or verify a dedicated `OpenAIProvider` class adhering to the `LLMProvider` interface.\n*   Support core generation functionalities (`generateText`, `streamText`, `generateObject`, `streamObject`) using OpenAI models.\n*   Utilize the latest official `openai` Node.js SDK.\n*   Correctly map `voltagent` generation options (model, temperature, max tokens, tool choice, etc.) to OpenAI API parameters.\n*   Implement robust support for OpenAI's tool calling mechanism, mapping seamlessly to `voltagent`'s tool definition and execution flow.\n*   Support OpenAI's JSON mode for reliable structured output generation (`generateObject`/`streamObject`).\n*   Handle authentication using OpenAI API keys.\n*   Integrate OpenAI-specific error handling and response parsing.\n\n**3. Proposed Architecture & Components:**\n\n*   **`OpenAIProvider`:** A class (potentially existing but needing review/update) within `agent/providers` implementing `LLMProvider`. It should:\n    *   Use the official `openai` Node.js library.\n    *   Handle API client initialization (API key, potentially base URL for proxies).\n    *   Implement `generateText`, `streamText`, `generateObject`, `streamObject`, correctly formatting requests (messages, tools, model parameters) and parsing responses/streams.\n    *   Specifically handle the `tool_calls` and `tool_results` message flow for tool usage.\n*   **Provider Registration:** Ensure `OpenAIProvider` is correctly registered and selectable.\n*   **Configuration:** Allow users to select 'openai' as the provider, specify models (e.g., 'gpt-4-turbo', 'gpt-3.5-turbo'), and provide API keys.\n*   **Tool Mapping:** Refine the logic that translates `voltagent` tool definitions into the format expected by the OpenAI API's `tools` parameter and processes `tool_calls` responses.\n\n**4. Affected Core Modules:**\n\n*   `agent/providers`: `OpenAIProvider` class implementation/refinement.\n*   `agent/types`: Ensure types accurately reflect OpenAI's request/response structures, especially for tools.\n*   `ToolManager`: Interaction with `OpenAIProvider` for formatting tool definitions and handling tool calls.\n*   `Agent`/`Agent Options`: Configuration for provider selection, models, and credentials.\n*   Requires the `openai` dependency.\n\n**5. Acceptance Criteria (Initial MVP / Refinement):**\n\n*   Users can configure an `Agent` to use `OpenAIProvider` with various GPT models (e.g., GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-3.5 Turbo) and an API key.\n*   `agent.generateText()` and `agent.streamText()` work correctly.\n*   `agent.generateObject()` and `agent.streamObject()` utilize OpenAI's JSON mode successfully.\n*   Agents can reliably use tools defined in `voltagent`, with requests and responses correctly handled via the OpenAI tool calling API.\n*   Relevant options (temperature, max tokens, tool choice) are passed correctly.\n*   Integration uses the current version of the official `openai` SDK.\n*   Documentation reflects the updated/verified OpenAI integration details.\n\n**6. Potential Challenges & Considerations:**\n\n*   Keeping up with frequent updates and changes in the OpenAI API and SDK.\n*   Ensuring the tool calling implementation is robust and handles various edge cases (multiple tool calls, errors).\n*   Mapping `voltagent`'s internal state/history accurately to the sequence of messages expected by OpenAI, especially when including tool results.\n*   Handling differences in behavior or features across different OpenAI models.\n*   Cost management and monitoring token usage for OpenAI API calls.",

      "description" : "Add \"Rename\" Button for Preset Management with Popup Modal\r\n\r\n**Description:**\r\nWe need to add a \"Rename\" button between the ComboBox (for selecting presets) and the \"Delete\" button. When clicked, this button should open a popup modal asking the user to enter a new name for the selected preset. Upon confirming, the preset's name should be updated in the object (`presets.name`) and the associated file. The previous file with the old name should be deleted.\r\n\r\n**Tasks:**\r\n\r\n1. **Add the \"Rename\" button:**\r\n   - Place the \"Rename\" button between the ComboBox (preset selector) and the \"Delete\" button.\r\n   - Ensure the button is clearly labeled and fits within the existing layout.\r\n\r\n2. **Implement the popup modal:**\r\n   - Create a modal that appears when the \"Rename\" button is clicked.\r\n   - The modal should include:\r\n     - An input field for the new preset name.\r\n     - \"Confirm\" and \"Cancel\" buttons.\r\n   - The \"Confirm\" button should only be enabled if the input field is not empty.\r\n\r\n3. **Handle renaming logic:**\r\n   - Update the `presets.name` property with the new name when the user clicks \"Confirm\".\r\n   - Rename the corresponding preset file to match the new name and delete the old file.\r\n   - Ensure the file renaming is done safely, checking for any name conflicts or invalid characters.\r\n\r\n4. **Update the ComboBox selection and display:**\r\n   - Refresh the ComboBox options to reflect the updated preset name.\r\n   - Maintain the current selection in the ComboBox with the new name after renaming.\r\n\r\n5. **Test the renaming functionality:**\r\n   - Verify that the \"Rename\" button opens the modal correctly.\r\n   - Test renaming with various inputs (valid, invalid, empty, conflicting names).\r\n   - Confirm that the file is renamed correctly and the old file is deleted.\r\n   - Ensure the ComboBox updates to reflect the new name without issues.\r\n\r\n6. **Update documentation:**\r\n   - Document the new \"Rename\" functionality.\r\n   - Update any relevant sections of the user guide to explain how to rename presets.\r\n\r\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\r\n- The \"Rename\" button appears between the ComboBox and \"Delete\" button and functions as intended.\r\n- The popup modal asks the user for a new name, and the \"Confirm\" button only works when a valid name is provided.\r\n- The preset's name is updated both in the object (`presets.name`) and the corresponding file.\r\n- The previous file is deleted after renaming.\r\n- The ComboBox correctly displays the updated preset name.\r\n- Documentation is updated to reflect the new feature.\r\n\r\n**Additional Context:**\r\n- The project uses ImGui, and the modal should integrate seamlessly with the existing UI.\r\n- Ensure that renaming presets does not interfere with other functionalities like saving, loading, or deleting presets.",

Additionally, OpenAI seems to strangely bounce you back-and-forth between two equally obscure error messages if you cut-and-paste the error & ask for assistance.\n\nHey Jeremy, sure, as an example, in pyproject.toml the `tool.poetry.source` section must be an array, like `[[tool.poetry.source]]` even if you only specify one source. This makes total sense as arrays with 1 entry are completely valid.  \n\nThe confusion is that poetry will give you the error in my original message, which tells you something should be an array but not _which_ something, so the solution currently is just to review your pyproject.toml file very carefully with respect to what each tool you have using it expects.", "We already replace `data.` with `tool.poetry.` in https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry-core/blob/002aa3e16f98d21645bb9a45f698b55adc40f317/src/poetry/core/factory.py#L606-L609.\n\nWe probably have to do the same in https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/blob/aeaa3d09ce7381bf34ac7e0ac27b929841256c90/src/poetry/factory.py#L335." ],

The actions-user bot will reset the file back to previous state for the next contributor after your commit is merged. So you can just simply start working with the issue right away!*\r\n\r\n## How to get started\r\nOpen the `tasks/yaml/medium` directory from the root of your project.\r\nThen open up the `docker-compose.yml` file and once it is properly created according to the YAML syntax and the task in hand, you are done and ready to make a pull request!\r\n*Note: You can test your YAML code in a editor like [this](http://www.yamllint.com/)*.\r\n\r\n## Description:\r\n\r\nYour task is to create a `docker-compose.yml` file that describes a multi-service application. This application should contain:\r\n\r\n-   A web server running on port 8080 using the nginx image.\r\n-   A database server running on the default port using the postgres image.\r\n\r\nThe web server should have access to the database server but not vice versa.\r\n\r\n## Requirements:\r\n\r\n-   Use Docker Compose version 3.\r\n-   Specify service names, image versions, and exposed ports.\r\n-   Set up a custom network and make sure only the web server can communicate with the database.\r\n-   Use environment variables to set the database name, user, and password for the PostgreSQL service.\r\n\r\n## Example Structure:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nversion: '3'\r\n\r\nservices:\r\n  # Define your services here\r\n  \r\nnetworks:\r\n  # Define your networks here\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Evaluation Criteria:\r\n\r\n-   Valid YAML syntax.\r\n-   Correct use of Docker Compose version and features.\r\n-   Correct network setup.\r\n-   The web server should be able to connect to the database, but the database should not have access to the web server.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions and how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

It is clear that many contributors are not reading the contributing.MD or the documentation update readme. \n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nWe are a welcoming community and we would like to include all regardless of their learning methodology. Some read, others watch. So, we would like a video to welcome contributors and walk them through the basics of contributing to KubeStellar. Once completed, we can create a shortcut url and give it to anyone with a question about making a contribution. This saves everyone time.\n\n### Are you willing to contribute?\n\n- [ ] Yes, I'd like to help implement this feature.\n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_",

If the available space falls below a certain threshold, the script should send an email alert to a specified email address.\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\n-   Threshold for low disk space should be configurable (e.g., below 20%).\r\n-   The email should contain detailed information about the disk space status.\r\n-   Use the `df` command for getting disk space information.\r\n-   Use `mail` command to send email.\r\n\r\nNext step is optional but if you would like to make this actually functional for email sending, you could use for example the mail command-line utility for that:\r\n\r\nOn Linux/Ubuntu:\r\n```bash\r\nsudo apt-get install mailutils\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn macOS:\r\n```bash\r\nbrew install mailutils\r\n```\r\n\r\n### To run the script:\r\n\r\nMake sure you are in the correct directory with the command:\r\n```bash\r\ncd tasks/bash/medium\r\n```\r\n\r\nEnsure you have the required permissions to execute the script by running this command:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nchmod +x disk_monitor.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nExecute the script:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./disk_monitor.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo work with this issue, you need to have Bash installed to your local machine.\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions of installing Bash and how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

The actions-user bot will reset the file back to previous state for the next contributor after your commit is merged. So you can just simply start working with the issue right away!*\r\n\r\n## How to get started\r\n\r\nFor this task you need to have Python and NumPy installed. Check out [Installing Python](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge#installing-python) section in README if you need to install Python. If you already have Python installed, you can install NumPy using pip (Python's package installer) with the following terminal command:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npip install numpy\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr, if you're using Python 3 specifically and have both Python 2 and Python 3 installed, you may need to use:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npip3 install numpy\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter that you can open the `tasks/python/hard` directory from the root of the project. \r\nThen open `decision_tree.py` file and start working on your solution!\r\n\r\n![python-hard](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/assets/82566656/3fc4a704-a734-4b90-90fc-476ab367b7a1)\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nImplement a Decision Tree Classifier from scratch using Python. Do not use libraries like scikit-learn that have pre-implemented classifiers; instead, use basic libraries like NumPy for numerical calculations.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\n\r\n-   Understand the theory behind Decision Trees.\r\n-   Implement a simple yet functional Decision Tree Classifier.\r\n-   Test the classifier on a dataset.\r\n\r\nUse any freely available classification dataset. Ensure the dataset has at least 3 features and at least 2 classes.\r\n\r\nImplementation Steps:\r\n-   Write functions to calculate Gini impurity or Information Gain.\r\n-   Implement a class DecisionTree with methods for fitting and predicting.\r\n-   Implement a function to print/visualize the tree.\r\n\r\nTesting:\r\n-   Split the dataset into training and test sets and evaluate your classifier.\r\n\r\nAcceptance Criteria:\r\n\r\n-   Successfully implement a Decision Tree Classifier from scratch.\r\n-   Evaluate the classifier on a dataset, showing reasonable performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).\r\n\r\nResources:\r\n\r\n-   [Decision Trees - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning)\r\n\r\n## How to run\r\n\r\nMake sure you are in the right directory:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncd tasks/python/hard\r\n```\r\n\r\nExecute the following command to run your Python script:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npython decision_tree.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected output\r\n\r\nOutput should look similar to this:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nThe predicted class for the sample [0.4, 0.6] is 0.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the output looks correct, you are ready to make a pull request!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo work with this issue, you need to have Python installed to your local machine.\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions of installing Python and how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

The actions-user bot will reset the file back to previous state for the next contributor after your commit is merged. So you can just simply start working with the issue right away!*\r\n\r\n### How to get started\r\n\r\nStart by opening the `tasks/python/easy` directory from the root of the project. \r\nThen open `number_list.py` file and start working on your solution!\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe aim of this task is to create a Python script that creates a list of numbers and performs simple operations on it. Specifically, the program should create a list of the first 10 natural numbers (1 through 10), print the list and print the sum of the numbers in the list.\r\n\r\nAcceptance Criteria:\r\n\r\n-   The program should create a list of the first 10 natural numbers.\r\n-   The program should print the created list to the console.\r\n-   The program should print the sum of the numbers in the list.\r\n\r\n*Hint: You can use Python's built-in `sum` function to calculate the sum of numbers in a list.*\r\n\r\n### How to run\r\n\r\nTo test the program, you can run `python3 tasks/python/easy/number_list.py` to see if it works as expected.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo work with this issue, you need to have Python installed to your local machine.\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions of installing Python and how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

      "comments" : [ "<!-- Answer -->\nThis issue is caused by a disconnect between the context available to Jinja templates during regular chart rendering and what is provided during drill-to-detail actions. When you drill, the frontend sends a new request that often lacks the full dashboard/global context (like dashboard filters or URL params) that your Jinja SQL expects, so the template renders incorrectly or with missing values. This is a known limitation and has been discussed in several issues and code reviews ([example](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/33591), [example](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/33579)).\n\nA workaround is to make your Jinja SQL more robust by using `if/else` blocks to provide default values when filters are missing, so the query always returns results and columns don't disappear. For example:\n\n```sql\nWITH calculation as (\n  SELECT count(*), country\n  FROM \"Vehicle Sales\"\n  WHERE 1=1\n  {% if filter_values('product_line') %}\n    and product_line in {{ filter_values('product_line')|where_in }}\n  {% else %}\n    and product_line = 'Classic Cars'\n  {% endif %}\n  GROUP BY country\n)\nSELECT * FROM calculation\n```\n([source](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/33591))\n\nIf your dataset relies on dashboard-level filters or variables, you may need to adjust your Jinja logic to handle cases where those are missing during drill actions.\n\nThere have also been recent changes to how Superset syncs dataset columns and processes Jinja templates, which can impact this behavior ([PR 30903](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/30903)). Make sure your configuration enables `ENABLE_TEMPLATE_PROCESSING` and that your feature flags are up to date.\n\nAt this time, there is no full workaround for preserving all dashboard context in drill-to-detail requests, but making your Jinja SQL more defensive can help avoid empty or broken results.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

Because Longhorn mutator webhook requires providing [the correct `metadata.labels`](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn-manager/blob/16f796214eb359cdb9f9efbe577a2de68144081b/webhook/resources/backup/mutator.go#L63-L67) while the doc does not mention that.\n\nThere are 2 solutions for this:\n- Simply updating the doc by adding `metadata.labels` for the example YAMLs\n- The mutator should figure out and set up the labels automatically based on the input `spec.snapshotName`\n\nNow I may prefer the latter one since this solution can both\n- provide a better user experience\n- and forcibly ask the mutator to check the volume and snapshot existence before backup creation\n\n### To Reproduce\n\n1. Create and attach a volume\n2. Create a random snapshot\n3. Apply the following backup YAML provided by the doc:\n```\napiVersion: longhorn.io/v1beta2\nkind: Backup\nmetadata:\n  name: backup-example\n  namespace: longhorn-system\nspec:\n  backupMode: full\n  snapshotName: <volume snapshot name>\n  labels:\n    app: test\n```\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe backup should be created correctly\n\n### Support Bundle for Troubleshooting\n\n```\nubuntu:~$ kubectl apply -f backup.yaml\nError from server (InternalError): error when creating \"backup.yaml\": Internal error occurred: failed calling webhook \"mutator.longhorn.io\": failed to call webhook: post \"https://longhorn-admission-webhock.longhorn-system.svc:9502/v1/webhook/mutation?timeout=10s\": EOF\n```\n\n### Environment\n\n- Longhorn version: master-head (07/02/2025)\n\n### Additional context\n\nThis issue was found by community contributor @nzhan126  when she tried to test a backup-related fix. \n\n### Workaround and Mitigation\n\nSet up `matadata.labels` for the backup YAML. For example:\n```\napiVersion: longhorn.io/v1beta2\nkind: Backup\nmetadata:\n  name: backup-example\n  namespace: longhorn-system\n  labels:\n    backup-volume: <volume name>\nspec:\n  backupMode: full\n  snapshotName: <volume snapshot name>\n  labels:\n    app: test\n```\n",

While it is not explicitly stored in the footer, it can be estimated by analyzing the number of pages via the `OrdinalIndex` and calculating the average page size.  \n\nIt might be worthwhile to include a few functions for inspecting a column's metadata.\n\nFurther more, we can also consider add these column stats into the optimizer statistics system, stored in the `_statistics_.column_statistics` table.\n\n",

As of now, Souvlaki leaves it up to the user to change the URL depending on the platform.\r\n\r\nFor Linux, we follow the MPRIS specification, which actually doesn't say much cover art apart from what's in [here](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/mpris-spec/metadata/#mpris:arturl). It only says that local files should start with `file://` and that it should be an UTF-8 string, which is enforced by Rust. Maybe you can look in the source code of desktop managers such as GNOME or KDE, since these read the field to display it on their media player controls.\r\n\r\nFor Windows, we use the _SystemMediaTransportControlsDisplayUpdater_, which has [a thumbnail property](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.media.systemmediatransportcontrolsdisplayupdater.thumbnail?view=winrt-22621#windows-media-systemmediatransportcontrolsdisplayupdater-thumbnail). It accepts multiple formats, but we choose to create it using an URI. If setting an URL starting with `file://`, the file is automatically loaded by souvlaki.\r\n\r\nFor MacOS, you can look into [these lines](https://github.com/Sinono3/souvlaki/blob/384539fe83e8bf5c966192ba28e9405e3253619b/src/platform/macos/mod.rs#L131-L137) of the implementation. These lines refer to creating an [MPMediaItemArtwork](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mediaplayer/mpmediaitemartwork) object.\r\n\r\nI hope this is of use to you.

Since we only update the annotations in node's metadata, i think we can refactor it to use `Patch`.\n\n**Solution**:\n\n1. Please do some research to make sure that replacing `Update` with `Patch` does not change the behavior of current impl.\n2. If it is possible to using `Patch`, then refactor the code in this package. \n3. Pass the test in this package.\n4.

SQLAlchemy or even some internal ([ElasticsearchSQLHook](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/dec2662190dd4480d0c631da733e19d2ec9a479d/airflow/providers/elasticsearch/hooks/elasticsearch.py#L113))\r\n> \r\n> cc: @potiuk @dstandish\r\n\r\n@Taragolis Why not implement another method named get_url and use that one to instantiate the SQLALchemy engine, as the engine can accept an SQLAlchemy URL object.  Also the SQLAlchemy URL class has a factory method named create, which easily allows you to create the URL without the hastle of string manipulations, this is how I did it for my custom SQL operator (the one I mentioned on Slack):\r\n\r\n```\r\n    def get_url(self) -> URL:\r\n        return URL.create(\r\n            self.scheme,\r\n            username=self.connection.login,\r\n            password=self.connection.password,\r\n            host=self.connection.host,\r\n            port=self.connection.port,\r\n        )\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso see [here ](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/core/engines.html#creating-urls-programmatically)the SQL documentation concerning creating URL's programmatically: [https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/core/engines.html#creating-urls-programmatically](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/core/engines.html#creating-urls-programmatically)\r\n\r\nI see @rawwar was first mentioning this, I think this would be a good idea and would simplify code and be less bug prone.", "There is new property which intends to returns SQL Alchemy URL, current behaviour of `get_url` is ambiguous and non-all hook return SA URI here, for some of the DB there is no even SA dialects exists, so better keep `get_url` as is and step-by-step migrate to appropriate ones.

Yes we should definitly leave the get_uri method as it is (not get_url as it doesn’t exist yet) and implement a new get_url method which would then be called by the existing get_sqlalchemy_engine.\r\n\r\nYes, adding new method is the way to go. How to do it, should be proposed and discussed in the PR, we have 20+ sql providers, and I think the proposal should be complete and explain how to deal with cases that can/cannot be mapped. Also the method should explicily - IMHO - call our sqlalachemy, (`getSqlAlchemyURI` ?) and likely allow variations - from what I understand SQLAlchemy can have different URLs not only for different databases, but also for different drivers. Also some of our Connections allows to add different kinds of extras and parameters - not only hosts but other parameters that might be used and passed differently to different drivers.\r\n\r\nIf we decide to introduce a new \"standard\" method, in a product like Airflow and common API like DBApiHook, the proposal should provide answers to all the questions that users might ask in order to be mergable. It does not have to handle all of those but at least get enough error handlling and interface specification to explain what is the transition from the Connection form (in all those cases we have DBAPI implementation) -> SQLAlchemy URL.  Which variations are handled, how it should work, how to map engine args etc. \r\n\r\nI don't think it can be handled by a single implementation, it's more a scaffloiding + implementation for all the implementations and it should be designed nicely with al least a handful (if not all) implementation from the above list to be quite sure that we will be able to handle those cases. \r\n", "\r\n> Hey Andrey think there is some confusion here.

Please @MisterJimson provide us a repository to test ", "Hello @MisterJimson, please provide a minimal reproduction. You can use one of the following options:\n\n- Provide a link to [our playground](https://biomejs.dev/playground), if it's applicable.\n- Provide a link to GitHub repository. To easily create a reproduction, you can use our interactive CLI via `npm create @biomejs/biome-reproduction`\n\nIssues marked with `S-Needs repro` will be **closed** if they have **no activity within 3 days**.", "I'm actually on the fence whether this should be considered a false positive at all. Files that either accidentally or intentionally import/export from themselves _are_ creating a cycle, albeit a very small one. In many cases I think people want to be alerted about this, so I think this isn't an issue, although you could open a discussion whether we should have an option for this case.\n\nWhat actually worries me more is why it's not being reported in your IDE \uD83E\uDD14 ", "FYI This case isn't marked as a cycle in eslint.

Currently, it is marked as \"the same as\". ", "I just tried it in both node and bun. Both allow the file to import itself without blowing up.\n\nAlthough I tend to agree that this would be a code smell.

Would need to disable https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-static-only-class/  though.\n\nThe other thing to consider is tree shaking. If it's purely an import style like I have now, I believe fully unused functions are still able to be removed. Would the same be true for a static class?

If I disable the ufw service i'm able to access my site using the V6 address, but when I enable ufw the connection times out. I found /etc/ufw/after6.rules and tried to modify it to work, but I must be doing something wrong.

This weekend I tried to set up a local IPv6 network by using VirtualBox, but not successful.\r\n\r\nI checked our servers and found the IPv6 address of `docker0` is like `fe80::aaaa:bbbb:cccc:dddd`, not `fe80::1` you showed. I'm not sure if this is an issue?\r\n\r\nFrom the document [IPv6 with Docker | Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/v17.09/engine/userguide/networking/default_network/ipv6/) we can see that the IPv6 address of `docker0` is like `2001:db8::c008/125`.\r\n\r\nSo sorry, I cannot help you now. But I would like to try IPv6 when I have time.\r\n\r\nIf you have any updates please let me know, thanks!", "@chaifeng thank you for your timely response. I took a look at the documentation you mentioned and made the changes that they describe. It now looks like the docker0 interface has two versions of an IPv6 address. I will admit i'm pretty new to firewalls and very new to ufw so i'm not even sure what the best way to debug this would be. I don't really need IPV6 container support and I think it would be better to have the IPV6 requests to my server to be forwarded as IPV4, but i'm not sure how to do that. \r\n\r\nThe reason I found this issue was because I was unable to access my website from my phone when not connected to WIFI. My LTE connection has an IPV6 address which makes my site unreachable.\r\n\r\nifconfig: \r\n```\r\ndocker0: flags=4099<UP,BROADCAST,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500\r\n        inet 172.17.0.1  netmask 255.255.0.0  broadcast 172.17.255.255\r\n        inet6 fe80::1  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>\r\n        inet6 2001:db8:1::1  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x0<global>\r\n        ether 02:42:0e:75:6d:9a  txqueuelen 0  (Ethernet)\r\n        RX packets 0  bytes 0 (0.0 B)\r\n        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0\r\n        TX packets 0  bytes 0 (0.0 B)\r\n        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have updated my after6.rules to reflect the new address:\r\n```\r\n# BEGIN UFW AND DOCKER\r\n*filter\r\n:ufw6-user-forward - [0:0]\r\n:DOCKER-USER - [0:0]\r\n-A DOCKER-USER -j RETURN -s 2001:db8:1::/64\r\n-A DOCKER-USER -p udp -m udp --sport 53 --dport 1024:65535 -j RETURN\r\n\r\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw6-user-forward\r\n\r\n-A DOCKER-USER -j DROP -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,ACK SYN -d 2001:db8:1::/64\r\n-A DOCKER-USER -j DROP -p udp -m udp --dport 0:32767 -d 2001:db8:1::/64\r\n\r\n-A DOCKER-USER -j RETURN\r\nCOMMIT\r\n# END UFW AND DOCKER\r\n```\r\n\r\nI enabled ufw logging and I can still see the request being blocked.

OpenWRT at the front, two vlans, server with docker on second vlan.  I always worry somehow I'm exposing my services over IPv6 by mistake because IPv6 doesn't work the same as IPv4-NAT. ", "@ShapeShifter499 I think the goal of `ufw-docker` is to block network access to docker containers running on the host from whatever network is attached to the host. Exactly like the goal of `ufw` is to block network access to processes running on the host from whatever network is attached to the host.\nThe network attached to the host can be public (typical of a public server rented from a provider) or private (typical of a home or company network).\nEven if your network is private, for whatever reason you might want to block access to a container (or to a specific port of that container) from that network and only allow access to it from the docker host.\nThe above is true regardless of whether your docker host has IPv4 or IPv6 (or both) on its network interface(s). You'll have to deal with separate and independent block rules for IPv4 and IPv6.\n\nIf your docker host is on a private network behind a router/firewall and you are happy for whatever container to be accessible from that private network, you may disregard `ufw-docker` completely and only use your router/firewall to control access from the public internet (or other private networks).\nThe above is also true regardless of whether your internet provider provides you with IPv4 or IPv6 (or both) connectivity. With home IPv4 connectivity there is typically NAT between the public internet and your private network that blocks inbound connections by default. If your ISP also provides you with IPv6 connectivity, that's typically not the case (afaik) and you really need to make sure your firewall (OpenWRT) has specific IPv6 rules in place to block all inbound connections by default and only allow the connections you want.", "this pr was merged https://github.com/chaifeng/ufw-docker/pull/92" ],

When I try to find the logs, the error step just showed \"running\" status, no other outputs.\n\n\nThen I try to get the docker logs (`docker-plugin_daemon-1`), I found that the plugin is always killed, so when it restart, the related request will be down.\n\nRelated logs\n```\n2025/05/07 07:05:37 stdio.go:166: [ERROR]plugin langgenius/volcengine_maas:0.0.13 has an error on stdout: bufio.Scanner: token too long\n2025/05/07 07:05:37 run.go:132: [ERROR]plugin langgenius/volcengine_maas:0.0.13 exited with error: signal: killed\n```\n\nThe `token` in `token too long` maybe not my prompt token, because I found various size image also have the same error.\n",

This can result in a token length that exceeds the limits set by the system. Here are some steps you can take to address this issue:您在使用 Dify 中的 Volcengine 插件时遇到的 \"标记太长 \"错误可能与处理大数据输入（如转换为 base64 编码的图像）有关。这可能导致标记长度超出系统设置的限制。以下是解决此问题的一些步骤：\n> \n> 1. **Reduce Image Size**: Try reducing the size of the images before uploading them to Dify. This can help prevent the base64 encoded data from exceeding the token limit.**减小图片大小 **：在将图片上传到 Dify 之前，请尝试减小图片大小。这有助于防止 base64 编码数据超出令牌限制。\n> 2. **Check Token Limits**: Ensure that the token limits for your model and API requests are configured correctly. Dify imposes a generation length limit of 2k tokens for reasoning models, which might be relevant if your workflow involves such models [[1]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/17120).**检查令牌限制 **：确保正确配置模型和 API 请求的令牌限制。Dify 为推理模型规定了 2k 标记的生成长度限制，如果您的工作流涉及此类模型，则可能与此相关 [[1]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/17120) 。\n> 3. **Switch Model Provider**: If you're using the `openai_api_compatible` provider, consider switching to a different model provider that might handle larger token sizes more effectively [[2]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/18657).**切换模型提供程序 **：如果您正在使用 `openai_api_compatible` 提供程序，请考虑切换到不同的模型提供程序，这样可以更有效地处理更大的标记大小 [[2]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/18657) 。\n> 4. **Review Workflow Configuration**: Double-check your workflow configuration to ensure that all parameters and settings are optimized for handling the data sizes you're working with.**审查工作流程配置 **：仔细检查您的工作流程配置，确保所有参数和设置都经过优化，以处理您正在处理的数据大小。\n> \n> By implementing these suggestions, you should be able to mitigate the \"token too long\" error and improve the stability of your plugin operations.通过实施这些建议，您应该可以减少 \"标记太长 \"错误，并提高插件运行的稳定性。\n> \n> _To continue talking to [Dosu](https://dosu.dev), mention [@dosu](https://github.com/dosu).要继续与 [Dosu](https://dosu.dev) 通话，请提及 。_\n> \n> Help Dosu learn!

This issue is to transfer the Onboarding section: [https://contribute.mautic.org/on-boarding](https://contribute.mautic.org/on-boarding). You can also update and improve the content on these pages if you like - do check with the team leads first to ensure it's relevant.\r\n\r\nYou can do this in the current repo, as we've got a folder set up, `/docs`, which will be used for Read The Docs.\r\n\r\nYou can build this documentation locally by cloning this repository, and following these steps: https://github.com/mautic/user-documentation/tree/5.x?tab=readme-ov-file#build-documentation-locally. Change into the /docs folder and then (assuming you have DDEV and Docker/Colima installed) type `ddev config` and select `build/html `as the root folder when configuring DDEV. Then when complete, type `ddev start` and it'll give you the link to your local testing environment.\r\n\r\nIf you need to make a link file to add an external URL, please use the command line tool 'make link'. This will generate a reference macro and a link file for you.\r\n\r\nFor internal linking check the docs on using the [:ref: role](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/cross-referencing-with-sphinx.html#the-ref-role) for linking within the same document, and using [:doc: to link across pages](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/cross-referencing-with-sphinx.html#the-doc-role).\r\n\r\n**Please note: if you see folders called .revs these are old version control files from Grav. Ignore them! (they should be deleted) and instead work on the actual files.**\r\n\r\nWhen you've converted the file/s, **they need to live within the /docs folder**. We can create a structure using sub-folders to organise the sections. You also need to add the pages to the Table of Contents in the index.rst file for them to show on the menu. Docs on the ToC can be found [here](https://sublime-and-sphinx-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/indices.html).\r\nWe highly recommend that you use VS Code with Vale installed. Let us know if you have any problems.\r\n\r\nSome useful resources: \r\n- https://sublime-and-sphinx-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest guide to Sphinx/RST formatting\r\n- https://sublime-and-sphinx-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/references.html#use-the-external-links-extension how to do external links - always check the /docs/links directory first! You can use the terminal command '`make link`' to create the link file automagically.\r\n\r\nThere are many MD to RST tools out there which can help speed up the process, however you will still need to review your output to ensure it passes our Vale grammar rules. Headings must always be unique, as well.\r\n\r\nWe use the following for headings:\r\n\r\n```\r\nH1 ###\r\nH2 ***\r\nH3 ===\r\nH4 ---\r\nH5 ~~~\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease ask in #t-education on Slack if you get stuck with anything!",

      "description" : "# Background\n\n[crash](https://crash-utility.github.io/)'s command-oriented interface, while less flexible than drgn, has some distinct advantages:\n\n* For common operations, it is much more terse.\n* Many kernel developers are already comfortable with it.\n\nThere have also been requests for a crash-to-drgn translation guide. As a response, we are porting crash commands to drgn, adding a `--drgn` option to onboard users to drgn's more advanced functionality.\n\n# Contributing\n\nThe porting process is being tracked in https://github.com/users/osandov/projects/2. If you would like to work on a command, comment here (or reach out to @osandov) and we will create a new issue to track that command. Commands with many options can be split up further.\n\nCurrently, this work is in the `commands` branch, which is still a work in progress and will be rebased often. It will eventually be merged into the `main` branch.\n\n# Guidelines\n\n* The output format and behavior of each crash command should be recreated relatively closely in order to prioritize onboarding for crash users. However, we can deviate from crash if needed.\n* New functionality should be added as drgn helpers as much as possible. Ideally, commands should mainly call helpers and format output.\n* Every command should have a `--drgn` option that prints how to do the equivalent operation using drgn APIs.\n* Commands should be added to modules under `drgn/commands/_builtin/crash`. Feel free to create a new module if appropriate.\n* Test cases should be added under `tests/linux_kernel/crash_commands` for every command. Since most functionality should be in helpers with thorough unit tests, test cases for commands can be basic smoke tests.\n\nSee `_crash_cmd_mount()` in `drgn/commands/crash/_builtin/fs.py` and `TestMount` in `tests/linux_kernel/crash_commands/test_fs.py` for examples.",

For instance if the network is congested and the tx was evicted, then we likely just need to retry and continue to use the fee estimator to get a more up to date fee. If our account is out of funds to pay for gas however, retrying isn't going to do anything and we should return to the user. \n\nI'm not sure tbh how the TxClient handles this as is, but ideally we should reuse that logic as much as possible. Meaning, if we can treat each chunk in a similar way to a single chunk, and retry/return to the user in the same ways, that seems like a great start.", "> we should likely retry, however it depends on the reasoning for the failure.

If our account is out of funds to pay for gas however, retrying isn't going to do anything and we should return to the user.\n\nGotcha. I'll try to make sure the code is adaptable in that regard.\n\nStupid question: Is the scope of this issue limited to adding the split/join or is it expected to have end-to-end code-completeness integrated in the current API?", "> Is the scope of this issue limited to adding the split/join or is it expected to have end-to-end code-completeness integrated in the current API?\n\nnot 100% sure what is meant by e2e completeness, but in general we can't add a buggy feature unless we know we can follow up before the next release", "Sorry, I didn't explain myself correctly.\n\nI mean: is the scope of this issue just to add blob splitting / joining logic (with tests, to be integrated in a subsequent incremental PR) or also to integrate these with the current submission and retrieval of blobs so that splitting and joining is performed automatically under the hood?\n\nI am happy either way, I am asking to make sure we are all on the same page with the scope and blast radius of the changes.\n\n\n", ">   integrate these with the current submission and retrieval of blobs so that splitting and joining is performed automatically under the hood?\n\nahh I see, for this we want a separate entry point. Users need to specifically opt into using the splitting for now as that is signing and submitting multiple txs.

      "description" : "We are in the process of moving this repository to Read the Docs, and to do that we need to convert our pages from Markdown to RST. This issue is to transfer the Marketing team section: [https://contribute.mautic.org/marketing-team](https://contribute.mautic.org/marketing-team). You can also update and improve the content on these pages if you like - do check with the team lead (cc @sdoering and @tobsowo) first to ensure it's relevant.\r\n\r\nYou can do this in the current repo, as we've got a folder set up, `/docs`, which will be used for Read The Docs.\r\n\r\nYou can build this documentation locally by cloning this repository, and following these steps: https://github.com/mautic/user-documentation/tree/5.x?tab=readme-ov-file#build-documentation-locally. Change into the /docs folder and then (assuming you have DDEV and Docker/Colima installed) type `ddev config` and select `build/html `as the root folder when configuring DDEV. Then when complete, type `ddev start` and it'll give you the link to your local testing environment.\r\n\r\nIf you need to make a link file to add an external URL, please use the command line tool 'make link'. This will generate a reference macro and a link file for you.\r\n\r\nFor internal linking check the docs on using the [:ref: role](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/cross-referencing-with-sphinx.html#the-ref-role) for linking within the same document, and using [:doc: to link across pages](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/cross-referencing-with-sphinx.html#the-doc-role).\r\n\r\n**Please note: if you see folders called .revs these are old version control files from Grav. Ignore them! (they should be deleted) and instead work on the actual files.**\r\n\r\nWhen you've converted the file/s, **they need to live within the /docs folder**. We can create a structure using sub-folders to organise the sections. You also need to add the pages to the Table of Contents in the index.rst file for them to show on the menu. Docs on the ToC can be found [here](https://sublime-and-sphinx-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/indices.html).\r\n\r\nWe highly recommend that you use VS Code with Vale installed. Let us know if you have any problems.\r\n\r\nSome useful resources: \r\n- https://sublime-and-sphinx-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest guide to Sphinx/RST formatting\r\n- https://sublime-and-sphinx-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/references.html#use-the-external-links-extension how to do external links - always check the /docs/links directory first! You can use the terminal command '`make link`' to create the link file automagically.\r\n\r\nThere are many MD to RST tools out there which can help speed up the process, however you will still need to review your output to ensure it passes our Vale grammar rules. Headings must always be unique, as well.\r\n\r\nWe use the following for headings:\r\n\r\n```\r\nH1 ###\r\nH2 ***\r\nH3 ===\r\nH4 ---\r\nH5 ~~~\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease ask in #t-education on Slack if you get stuck with anything!",

This is not an acceptable UI, especially for core site functionality like upvoting.\n\n@ninakali Could you share which tool and setting you used to produce the screenshots? I've used a few over the years and would like to be certain we don't accidentally test with one that doesn't accurately reproduce your problem. The easiest way to ensure that would be to reuse.\n\nImplementor: If it's possible, I'd prefer not to change the 'brand' red upvoted color as it's core UI, though that's secondary to a functional UI. Or to say the reverse, maybe the best first approach would be to lighten the unvoted gray (though this may start looking like a disabled form element) or an outline.\n\n\nTo connect some context: \n\n#1494 is related and could be done with or separately from this fix. There is even an [insufficiently concerned](https://github.com/lobsters/lobsters/issues/1494#issuecomment-2740754925) comment from me that the proposal might not be accessible; I didn't consider the existing UI.\n\n#1090 is also about this UI but may be stale, I'll post more info there.", "I asked for help with this [in chat](https://lobste.rs/chat) and got a suggestion that's deploying now.

It is difficult to find the mode that would reflect my experience the best. In theory, I have protanomaly, that makes red shades appear less bright and \"green-ish\", but in practice, an image with \"protanomaly\" filter still looks somewhat different to an image without any filters. \"Achromatomaly\" mode looked right because I couldn't quite tell the difference between the image with this filter and without it under the light conditions I've had in my room at the moment. \n\nSide note: I feel like \"true tone\" setting set to \"On\" in MacOS might affect how I see colours. This is a default setting, so I prefer to keep it as is." ],

This increased use should bring more contributions as bug reports and feature proposals.\n\n### Regression test\n(Ensure the feature doesn't cause any regressions)\n- [ ] Write adequate test cases and submit test results\n- [ ] Test results should be reviewed by a person from the team\n\n### Links / references\n\n_Please note that this was taken from GitLab, to be changed accordingly_",

Or another option could be if the placement cache was deleted and subsequently the user calls a few \"appends\" in a row, to assume there are more coming and have some code that regenerates the placement cache a-priori.

      "description" : "## Background\r\n\r\nWhen debugging anything related to a device driver, the first step is often finding the `struct device` that represents the device in the kernel. One way to find a device is by its sysfs path. However, drgn doesn't currently have an easy way to do that. You can _kind of_ do it with something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> path = path_lookup(\"/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:06.0/0000:04:00.0/nvme/nvme0/nvme0n1\")\r\n>>> kn = cast(\"struct kernfs_node *\", path.dentry.d_inode.i_private)\r\n>>> kobject = cast(\"struct kobject *\", kn.priv)\r\n>>> device = container_of(kobject, \"struct device\", \"kobj\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this has a few issues:\r\n\r\n* Clearly it's not convenient at all.\r\n* `path_lookup()` walks the dentry cache, which may not be populated for a particular path depending on memory pressure.\r\n* `path_lookup()` doesn't resolve symlinks (yet, see #216), so you have to use the canonical path instead of a more convenient symlink like `/sys/block/nvme0n1`.\r\n\r\nInstead, we should improve our kernfs helpers and provide sysfs-specific helpers on top of those. This can be broken down into multiple smaller features.\r\n\r\n## kernfs\r\n\r\nsysfs is actually an instance of [kernfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernfs_(Linux)), which is generic infrastructure for pseudo file systems. A kernfs filesystem comprises a tree of [`struct kernfs_node`](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/include/linux/kernfs.h?id=1d227fcc72223cbdd34d0ce13541cbaab5e0d72f#n181), each of which represents a file or directory.\r\n\r\nWe already have a few basic helpers for inspecting kernfs: https://drgn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/helpers.html#kernfs. I would like two extensions to those:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add a `kernfs_children()` helper that returns an iterator over the children of a directory in kernfs. Children are represented by [`struct kernfs_node::dir::children`](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/include/linux/kernfs.h?id=1d227fcc72223cbdd34d0ce13541cbaab5e0d72f#n156).\r\n- [ ] Extend the `kernfs_walk()` helper to follow symlinks. These are represented by [`struct kernfs_node::symlink::target_kn`](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/include/linux/kernfs.h?id=1d227fcc72223cbdd34d0ce13541cbaab5e0d72f#n171). We should probably also have a `follow_symlinks` parameter that controls what we do if the last component of a path is a symlink, similar to the Python [`os`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#files-and-directories) module.\r\n\r\n## sysfs\r\n\r\nOnce we have the kernfs changes, we can add sysfs-specific helpers that use the new kernfs features.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add a `sysfs_lookup_node()` helper that returns the `struct kernfs_node *` at a given path.\r\n- [ ] Add a `sysfs_lookup()` helper that returns the actual object (e.g., `struct device *`, `struct bus *`, etc.) represented by a given path.\r\n- [ ] Add a `sysfs_listdir()` helper that lists the names of the children of a sysfs directory at a given path.",

I ended up updating OpenImageIO to v2.6.2.0-dev since that is the one where the need for the boost dependency was removed.

Anyway after doing so I ended up only updating OpenImageIO and OpenEXR to slightly newer versions than what was listed in the original build_osl.py file because OSL was looking for Imath, but couldn't find it in ILMBase. So wanted to use a version of OpenEXR when Imath was seperated from it, and then add the same version of Imath as OpenEXR.

I don't understand why this error persists. I'm also using OpenImageIO v2_5_11. So I know in the Install file for OSL it says it will work with v2_5, but wanted to check and make sure that if it's at the tail end of it, there wouldn't be issues (I wouldn't believe so, since this is the version that works with Blender currently).", "This is not an issue in your CI work, it's an actual problem in OSL where building shared libs is broken currently, oslexec does not link oslcomp, but does [something a bit naughty](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenShadingLanguage/blob/main/src/liboslexec/CMakeLists.txt#L143) and gets to the symbols it needs by including the required cpp files from oslcomp into the oslexec build. And seemingly it needs more symbols now, than it needed previously. \r\n\r\nWe ran into this today with the blender deps build (no fix as of yet), but this broke somewhere between 1.13.7.0 and the 1.14 beta \r\n\r\n", "Presumably caused by #1890.", "Potential fix in #1918, can someone check if it works?", "works\r\n ", "Okay sweet, and thanks. I will try pulling in the latest changes soon, and seeing if my CI completes it's build with that fix. How should I go about getting permission to push my commit with the updated CI? And I assume the one that uses the version of OpenImageIO that doesn't require boost, is the commit I should be pushing.", "Sorry for the wait on this. After getting the release version of the build setup and working, I moved onto the debug version but ran into some issues which came to a head at pybind11's debug build. This issue gave me a lot of trouble, and I meant to come back to it eventually for a better look later but got caught up in other work. \n\nAnyway I made mention of the issue in the commit I made on my own fork of the repo, but essentially a repeating error of \"IMPORTED_LOCATION not set for important target\" is given for a variety of targets such as: \"pybind11::module\", \"pybind11::thin_lto\", \"pybind11::windows_extras\", \"pybind11::pybind11\", etc.\n\nI believe the reason for this error may be resolved by editing the CMake code regarding pybind11, but if that is the solution then that is something I don't feel comfortable editing. Since all of my focus has been within the build_install directory, when I have had the time to work on this issue.\n\nI continued the debug build past pybind11 by removing it from the list of dependencies to build, and the other dependencies were able to build just fine including the final OSL build. There is one additional error regarding glut.h not being copied into the proper folder, but I gave a list of steps to follow regarding copying the file into it's correct folder (in the Readme). That file is needed by Partio, during it's build.\n\nBesides that I updated various versions of the dependencies, added IMath to build_osl.py, and updated the ReadMe for the build with this new information, including what dependencies needed to be installed by the user and which would automatically be installed by running the Release and Debug versions of the build_osl.bat script. Let me know if there's any other information you need, or anything regarding procedure In need to do for the commit of this issue.\n\nThanks,\nNate" ],

      "description" : "### Proposal summary\n\nWe like to extend the existing evaluation metrics to include a new metric called \"Trajectory Accuracy\". Esentially we are evaluating ReAct style agents by reasoning about the sequence of actions taken and their outcomes. Based on the paper “ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models” https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629. You can also see the Langchain implementation here:\n- https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/evaluation/langchain.evaluation.agents.trajectory_eval_chain.TrajectoryEvalChain.html\n- https://github.com/langchain-ai/agentevals/tree/main/python/agentevals/trajectory\n\nExample of an existing judge metric (Hallucination) is defined here:\n- Docs: https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/evaluation/metrics/hallucination\n- Docs Code: https://github.com/comet-ml/opik/blob/main/apps/opik-documentation/documentation/fern/docs/evaluation/metrics/hallucination.mdx\n- Python SDK: https://github.com/comet-ml/opik/tree/main/sdks/python/src/opik/evaluation/metrics/llm_judges/hallucination\n- Python Examples: https://github.com/comet-ml/opik/blob/main/sdks/python/examples/metrics.py\n- Frontend: https://github.com/comet-ml/opik/blob/main/apps/opik-frontend/src/constants/llm.ts\n\nIdeally this is implemented as an LLM-as-a-judge. Expectation is the new judge is added to the frontend for using LLM-as-a-judge from the UI (Online Evaluation tab) as well as in the Python SDK. The appropriate docs needs to be updated and a video attached of the metric working.\n\nReturn should be float (0-1), and if its using LLM as a eval then should also contain a \"reason/explanation\"\n\n### Motivation\n\nI would like to see more robust set of metrics and evaluations based on recent research.",

      "description" : "### Application\n\nOutline Manager\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nWhen using GCP option in \"ADD SERVER\" tab the app hangs on create server step. \nThe problem is connected to missing `projects/ubuntu-os-cloud/global/images/family/ubuntu-2004-lts` image that should be used when creating a compute engine instance. \n\nIn GCP logs for compute engine the following error message can be found:\n```\nThe resource 'projects/ubuntu-os-cloud/global/images/family/ubuntu-2004-lts' was not found\n```\nFor reference see [Operating system details](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/os-details#ubuntu_lts) section of Compute Engine Documentation. It clearly states that EOS and image deprecation date for tis image is May 2025. \n\nI suspect the error can be easily fixed by updating [this line](https://github.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-apps/blob/55d09c01704909e1142fd14e2a91d5525872efd0/server_manager/www/gcp_account.ts#L275), but I'm not sure what image is to be used (otherwise I could try to open a PR). \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. open Outline Manager\n2. connect to GCP account\n3. create a project using \"ADD SERVER\" tab\n4. create server using on of the locations (same behaviour is observed for multiple server locations)\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\nSuccessfully completed addition of new server as it was before.\n\n### What actually happened?\n\nI've tried to create a new GCP server using the respective option in \"ADD SERVER\" tab. \n\n### Outline Version\n\n1.17.2\n\n### What operation system are you using?\n\nmacOS\n\n### Operating System Version\n\nSonoma 14.6.1\n\n### Screenshots and Videos\n\n_No response_",

This is great.\n\nI've noticed in my own experimentation, plus reviewing these PRs, that my biggest concern is that we just don't have enough tests. A lot of code is untouched by the test suite. Codecov is not the perfect tool here, because it has a little trouble parsing fypp -> f90, so it marks some lines as not covered that are actually covered. Still, there are things like the output files, the probes, data transfer between simulation -> post_process, and so on. \n\nThe code is not so hard to refactor, but there are some areas that are concerning. I suspect that #914 is a side effect of me or someone else's PR (I could be wrong). This case simply wasn't tested in CI appropriately.\n\nThere is a tango required to get decent tests without overfitting to specific computers or spending 10 hours in CI running (plus another 10 hours queuing in some cases). But I would rather have good tests so we can more confidently refactor and add features than be cavalier about merging quite important changes into the code. \n\nAn example is #907 from @XZTian64 or #855 (and similar) from @Malmahrouqi3 and #901 from me. I'm not fully confident that nothing will go wrong in merging these, despite the tests. The ones that involve writing probes or post_process are most concerning at the moment, I think." ],

The **Overview** tab updates to clearly show the scheduled rollout date and percentage.\n\nThis makes the state clear, avoids user errors, and reinforces the schedule as the single source of truth.\n\nLet me know your thoughts!

      "description" : "### \uD83D\uDE80 The feature, motivation and pitch\n\nI want to add a unit test for AOTI testing if user_managed weights works with load_state_dict.\n\nIt can follow a similar test https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/test/inductor/test_aot_inductor.py#L5733-L5835, but the new test is supposed to be simpler. \n\nUser managed is the last bool passed into update_constant_buffer:\nhttps://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/d5d14ee823e70224a154884a5c2912643d648094/torch/_C/_aoti.pyi#L28\n\n# Motivation:\n\nAOTI will take in an eager (i.e. un-compiled)model and spit out a AOTI Model that is compiled. update_constant_buffer is an api to update the weights of such model. If we set user_managed=True, the new weights that we are passing in should just point to the tensors (i.e. no copy is done). So ideally, if we update the tensors we passed it, the changes should reflect on the AOTI model. This is already tested in test_update_user_managed_buffer.\n\nWhat I want to see tested is if we:\n1. pass in the model weights to AOTI model with user managed\n2. Update the eager model weights with load_state_dict\n3. Check if the update is reflected on the AOTI model.\n\n### Alternatives\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\ncc @chauhang @penguinwu @avikchaudhuri @gmagogsfm @zhxchen17 @tugsbayasgalan @angelayi @suo @ydwu4 @desertfire @chenyang78 @yushangdi @benjaminglass1",

Is it still relevant or not?", "From what I can tell, we could introduce a new configuration option to truncate large data fields within the ValueObject property. A good place to implement this might be here:\n\uD83D\uDC49 https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/blob/master/pkg/apis/application/v1alpha1/values.go#L34.\n\nIf the serialized data at this point (https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/blob/master/pkg/apis/application/v1alpha1/values.go#L20) is too large, we could truncate it accordingly.\n\nAdditionally, I'm considering introducing levels of truncation for deeply nested JSON structures. For this, we could add a --log-json-max-depth configuration flag. For example, if --log-json-max-depth=2, everything deeper than 2 levels would be replaced with a placeholder like \"...(truncated)\".\n\nGiven the following example:\n```\n{\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"name\": \"app\",\n    \"labels\": {\n      \"env\": \"prod\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"spec\": {\n    \"containers\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"nginx\",\n        \"resources\": {\n          \"limits\": {\n            \"cpu\": \"500m\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\nWith --log-json-max-depth=2, it would become:\n```\n{\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"name\": \"app\",\n    \"labels\": \"...(truncated)\"\n  },\n  \"spec\": {\n    \"containers\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"nginx\",\n        \"resources\": \"...(truncated)\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\nThis would allow users to control how much detail they want to include in logs, preventing overly verbose output while retaining useful context.

While doing going through the code base, I was able to detect the code that is rendering the UserDropdown.tsx \r\nhttps://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/apps/studio/components/interfaces/Auth/Users/UsersListItem.tsx \r\n\r\nI noticed it is possible to check if the user is already confirmed from this line \r\nhttps://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/apps/studio/components/interfaces/Auth/Users/UsersListItem.tsx#L29\r\n\r\nI think I can either passed the isUserConfirmed to the UserDropdown.tsx component or create another derive state  inside the UserDropdown.tsx as it is derived from UsersListItem.tsx and then render the text inside https://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/apps/studio/components/interfaces/Auth/Users/UserDropdown.tsx#L160 using the state. \r\n\r\n3. For the two bonuses. I think, I was able to locate the part that renders them\r\nhttps://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/apps/studio/components/interfaces/Auth/AuthTemplatesValidation.tsx \r\n\r\nIf I get the first bonus part, this line https://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/apps/studio/components/interfaces/Auth/AuthTemplatesValidation.tsx#L151 should be  *Password Recovery*\r\n\r\nFor the second bonus, I think using the \"Magic Link\" format is okay. \r\n\r\nThough, I was able to build the project on my local system. I need a little guidance on recognising on how I can get to this pages.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n", "Hi @Hallidayo, I am looking for my open source contribution.\r\nCan I pick this issue? ", "@hkrhemendra, I think you did not read the previous conversation, I am already working on this issue, I think there are couples of other good first issues on the issue tracker list. ", "Hi @Unique-Usman - Thank you for taking a look into this one.\r\n\r\nYep thats the correct component to use. I think its good to just have the one item displayed so if the user is awaiting an invite the button should be:\r\n\r\n`Send Invite Link`\r\n\r\nIf the user is confirmed then the default button should be displayed:\r\n\r\n`Send Magic Link`\r\n\r\nFor the headings in the Email Templates that is the correct file. Its the `title` key in each object that needs to be checked. Its probably best to uppercase the start of each word so `Invite user` to `Invite User`.\r\n\r\nAre you able to view the Email Templates locally? ", "@Hallidayo, thanks for your reply. I was unable to view the Email Template Locally, I could not figure out the link. \r\n\r\nIs it *Send Invite Link* or *Confirm SignUp Link*. \r\nAlso the user can be checked if already confirmed through  `const isUserConfirmed = user.email_confirmed_at || user.phone_confirmed_at`, in this scenerio, we just havae to check for the `user.email_confirmed_at` ?\r\n", "@Unique-Usman - If you go to http://localhost:8082/project/default/auth/templates you should then get the templates showing for you locally.\r\n\r\nSorry yes it should be Confirm Sign Up Link.\r\n\r\nYeah you should be able to use the `isUserConfirmed` constant to switch between the two items.\r\n\r\nFeel free to reach out if you need anything!", "@Hallidayo, I have a first PR for the resolvement of the issues https://github.com/supabase/supabase/pull/27759, kindly check thank you.

A feature like this would allow us to efficiently send a warning to one or more players, which would then justify us to take actions with more confidence and with a longer punishment time.\n\nWith the current solutions, there's no effective way of communicating with the player in a way that proves, without denial, that we are authenticated as a moderator. Currently, players may ignore chat messages or even completely disable the chat, which would make any form of communication hopeless. A form of communication like this would be important before taking more aggressive actions, such as kicking or banning.\n\nA feature like this would allow us to scare most players who aren't fully aware of the consequences. Allowing us to send a message to a group of players, regardless of whether they are blocking or not, without consequences. This can be applied in chaotic cases that casual methods of moderation wouldn't be feasible, such as in Linear and Multeasymap servers.",

Out of convenience, people began plucking out values and using them in non-dataviz use cases.\n\nThis topic will inevitably lead toward _\"Do we still need the palettes then?\"_\n- I would hash that out with the data viz experts.\n- Note that these palettes are also exposed to users when building visualizations so, in that regard, we may need to keep the component but be more restrictive on its use and guidelines." ],

Considering how often people ask about examples, I think it might make more sense to put one combined page on the main site, and potentially link to it from both docs. It would also then make sense, I imagine, to add a column for \"BeeWare component(s) used\". \n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nWe could still maintain separate pages, but I'm not sure if there's a good way to make sure they stay in sync with each other. It's also not clear, currently, from just looking at one, which of the apps also use the other.\n\nIf we do keep the individual pages, it seems redundant to mention that each app uses the tech in question.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

I disabled Windows search indexing on my Nextcloud directory because windows kept on downloading files I wanted to only keep online every time I searched for something in the parent folder.\n\nThe search function in the Nextcloud tray menu is able to find the desired sub folder, but clicking the folder only opens the containing folder and not the folder itself. This is useless to me because, as said, there are a lot of different folders and the folder names are too similar.\n\nIt looks like Nextcloud just opens the containing folder for folders or files. It would be nice if there was at least a context open to allow opening folder or files.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nOpen folder or file by default and have open containing folder the context menu option, but that risks messing with other people's workflow since open containing folder is the current behavior.",

Cry a little\n\n**Expected behavior**\nI expected that a failure would show a toast or something to tell me how to fix the problem. The message returned from the API has the information I would need.

      "description" : "### Check for existing issues\r\n\r\n- [X] Completed\r\n\r\n### Describe the feature\r\n\r\nOn my Gnome-based Ubuntu 22.04.4 Linux system I configure all my window controls (close, maximize, minimize) to be on the left. I'd like for something akin to `tabs.close_position` but for the general Zed window controls. Maybe `window_control_position` with `\"left\"`, `\"right\"`, and `\"default\"` as available values? \r\n\r\nI'm running the official Zed v0.143.6 build for Linux\r\n\r\n### If applicable, add mockups / screenshots to help present your vision of the feature\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently it looks like this on my system:\r\n\r\n![right-side](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/assets/10504957/d18cb293-680e-4a8b-b8ca-9cf633070fbd)\r\n\r\nHere's a mockup of what it might look like on my system if `window_control_position` was set to `\"left\"`\r\n\r\n![zed-left-side](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/assets/10504957/882cc922-6101-4e66-a6cf-0ea52200f4ab)\r\n\r\n(I know that I also reordered the other title bar elements, but preserving their general order as they are today is not a problem either I think. Just as long as the window controls are on the left)\r\n\r\nFor reference, here's what gnome-terminal with its window controls looks like on my system:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/assets/10504957/08d91a64-1767-4b66-8df7-51c2362df324)\r\n",

However, if I set up a rule to append to a note, no space is added between the note and added text. I'm ok with either behavior, but would prefer it to be consistent.\n\n### How can we reproduce the issue?\n\nSelect a transaction, bulk edit note, prepend or append, type anything in. You will notice a space is placed in between the old and new text.\n\nCreate a rule (or just use the rule editor to bulk edit) that prepends or appends to a note, run it, you'll see that no space is added.\n\n### Where are you hosting Actual?\n\nDocker\n\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\n\nChrome, Firefox\n\n### Operating System\n\nWindows 11",

      "comments" : [ "DataFlex uses a lot of different file extensions, some of which will likely have conflicts. Modern DataFlex uses a common workspace structure, such as `AppSrc/cMyClass.pkg`. Searching for [NOT is:fork path:Appsrc/**.pkg](https://github.com/search?type=code&q=NOT+is%3Afork+path%3AAppsrc%2F**.pkg\n) narrows it down to effectively DataFlex source code files and provides 900+ results. Many of the other file extensions are nowhere near that many, so it won't meet the minimum usage requirements.\n\nGiven that there are so many file extensions in use, maybe a better initial approach could be to add support for DataFlex without specifying `extensions` or `filenames` to avoid conflicts. And DataFlex source repositories can use `.gitattributes` overrides for the relevant extensions instead. Obviously not ideal, but it would at least provide recognition for the DataFlex language, and that's a great starting point.\n\nI see there is some precedence for languages without specifying file extensions, such as for Elvish transcripts from PR #6302, which is mainly used inside markdown files. @lildude and @NilsSve, I can help and put up a PR for adding the DataFlex language without specifying any file extensions, would that work?\n", "Hi Sonny,\n\nIf you are asking me, yes, that would help! The current repositories at @NilsSve are using .gitattributes exactly as suggested.", "> I see there is some precedence for languages without specifying file extensions, such as for Elvish transcripts from PR [#6302](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/pull/6302), which is mainly used inside markdown files. [@lildude](https://github.com/lildude) and [@NilsSve](https://github.com/NilsSve), I can help and put up a PR for adding the DataFlex language without specifying any file extensions, would that work?\n\nIt would \"work\" but it won't be accepted. The Elvish exception is because there isn't a common extension as it's predominantly used in a markdown files. This is not the case with DataFlex.\n\nI know nothing about DataFlex but wikipedia says \"DataFlex is an object-oriented high-level programming language and a fourth generation visual tool for developing Windows, web and mobile software applications on one framework-based platform.\"\n\nWe do not add support for frameworks, hence we support Ruby, but not Rails, so the right thing to do is concentrate on only the language files. I'd expect the language to have a common extension and structure that can be identified.  This should be what is added first, assuming usage meets requirements, and then users can use the overrides to classify the other extensions if they want.\n\nIf the language predominantly uses a generic extension like `.pkg` (poor design decision IMO), this can be added the `generic.yml` file and a heuristic will be used to identify the language, but be warned: this heuristic _must_ be very accurate to only identify DataFlex files and must be linear and performant. It's better for this regex to under identify DataFlex files than misidentify other languages.", "> It would \"work\" but it won't be accepted. The Elvish exception is because there isn't a common extension as it's predominantly used in a markdown files. This is not the case with DataFlex.\n\nI see. That makes sense. DataFlex is an old language that's been around in its current object-oriented form for 20+ years. Its use is mainly for database business applications, for Windows and web apps. It unfortunately doesn't have a single dedicated file extension, and the convention is to use one of a set of extensions representing the main purpose of the specific DataFlex source file. Such as `.vw` for a view, and other extensions for database business logic etc. The `.pkg` extension is typically used for reusable classes, which is why it's the predominant extension seen on GitHub.\n\n> If the language predominantly uses a generic extension like .pkg (poor design decision IMO), this can be added the generic.yml file and a heuristic will be used to identify the language, but be warned: this heuristic must be very accurate to only identify DataFlex files and must be linear and performant. It's better for this regex to under identify DataFlex files than misidentify other languages.\n\nThat sounds like a great idea, thanks! I will pursue this strategy for the `.pkg` file extension since it's the most commonly used extension. I'll follow the instructions and add it to `generic.yml` with heuristics and tests. Thanks again!", "And may I add that DataFlex has two frameworks. One for Windows and one for the Web, with overlaps between them for datadictionaries for consistent database behaviour.\n\nHowever, the frameworks are not optionals/add-ons like in many other languages. Instead they are an integrated part of the DataFlex language. And they are written in the DataFlex language.\n\nSure, a web-based DataFlex application also uses javascript libraries and many other parts needed for a modern webapp, but those files are not part of the frameworks. The build in frameworks are more guided towards how to develop applications more easy, fluently and make the code more robust and easier to follow." ],

Either way, this would be cool to have, but it might require KDE frameworks (tons of deps). The Wayland protocol is simple enough: https://wayland.app/protocols/kde-appmenu. The hard part is that it requires drawing a menu to a wl_surface, which would be a lot of work. Also, events need to be handled with DBus (maybe the work done in https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/pull/13098 could help?).",

      "description" : "# \uD83C\uDFAF Triple-Feature Mission – UX Enhancements\n\nLet’s tackle **three small but impactful user experience improvements** in one go! These enhancements aim to improve how citizens interact with the issue reporting and tracking flow.\n\n---\n\n## 1. \uD83D\uDCCB Copy Issue Link Button\n\n### Problem\nThere’s currently no easy way to share a direct link to a specific issue.\n\n### Solution\n- Add a **copy-to-clipboard** button (copy icon) near each issue title.\n- Clicking it should copy the full permalink of the issue (e.g., `https://civix.app/issues/42`) to the user’s clipboard.\n- Display a **toast notification** confirming the action.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```jsx\n<IssueHeader>\n  <h2>{issue.title}</h2>\n  <CopyLinkButton issueId={issue.id} />\n</IssueHeader>\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2. \uD83C\uDF89 Submission Confirmation\n\n### Problem\nAfter reporting an issue, users aren’t clearly informed about success or what to do next.\n\n### Solution\n- Show a **modal popup** confirming successful submission.\n- Include the **new issue ID** (e.g., Issue #42).\n- Offer two clear next steps:\n  - ✅ View the reported issue\n  - ➕ Report another issue\n\n### Mock Layout\n\n```\n+-----------------------------+\n|  \uD83C\uDF89 Thank You!             |\n|  ✓ Issue #42 reported!     |\n|                             |\n|  [ View Issue ] [ Report Another ] |\n+-----------------------------+\n```\n\n---\n\n## 3. \uD83D\uDD22 Smart Character Counters\n\n### Problem\nUsers can’t see how many characters they’ve typed or how close they are to a limit.\n\n### Solution\n- Add **live character counters** to all long-text input fields (e.g., description).\n- Use color indicators:\n  - \uD83D\uDFE2 Normal (< 80%): gray text (`text-gray-500`)\n  - \uD83D\uDFE0 Near Limit (≥ 80%): orange text (`text-orange-500`)\n  - \uD83D\uDD34 Over Limit: red text (`text-red-600`)\n- Set configurable limits (e.g., 500 characters).\n\n### Example UI States\n\n| State       | Color         | Example        |\n|-------------|---------------|----------------|\n| Normal      | Gray          | `45 / 500`     |\n| Near Limit  | Orange        | `410 / 500`    |\n| Over Limit  | Red           | `502 / 500`    |\n\n---\n\n## \uD83E\uDDEA Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] All features work correctly in **both Light and Dark modes**\n- [ ] Fully **mobile-responsive**\n- [ ] No regressions or broken functionality\n- [ ] (Optional) Components added to **Storybook** if applicable\n- [ ] Code includes clear, maintainable structure with reusable components\n\n---\n\n## \uD83E\uDDF0 Tech Notes\n\n- Copy button may use [`navigator.clipboard.writeText()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clipboard/writeText)\n- Toasts can use an existing toast component or [React Hot Toast](https://react-hot-toast.com/)\n- Character counter can be a custom hook or inline logic for now\n\n---\n\n## \uD83D\uDCCC Related Areas\n\n- `IssueDetail.jsx`\n- `NewIssueForm.jsx`\n- `components/ui/Toast.jsx`\n- `components/ui/Modal.jsx`\n- `components/CharacterCounter.jsx` (to be created)\n\n---\n\n**Let’s ship these delightfully helpful improvements \uD83D\uDE80**\n",

Usually this occurs when an app is buggy and only sends the leaf certificate without its chain, and explicitly trusting the leaf's issuing intermediate CA seems to fix the problem for them. Crucially, when that intermediate is then rotated their app will break.\r\n\r\nWe could add a toggle, defaulting to false, such as `allowIntermediateCertificates`. If false, it would parse every certificate and ensure that it's self-signed. There might be other ways of achieving the same goal.\r\n\r\nHaving this in from the start could prevent so many misconfigurations by unsuspecting cluster admins.\r\n\r\n(Complication: If we added a list of publicly trusted certs it'd probably need to default to allowing intermediates in that list by default - but we could definitely default to disallowing intermediates everywhere else)",

We have labeled each network set with something like `networking.our.internal.stuff/networkset: <name>` to be able to select a single network set in our network policies. We are concerned that someone accidentally adds the same label to a pod or another resource and thus undermines our network policies.\n\n## Expected Behavior\n<!--- If you're describing a bug, tell us what should happen -->\n<!--- If you're suggesting a change/improvement, tell us how it should work -->\n\nIt would be cool if something similar to `projectcalico.org/orchestrator` exists that lets us specify the resource type we want to select. \n\n## Current Behavior\n<!--- If describing a bug, tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->\n<!--- If suggesting a change/improvement, explain the difference from current behavior -->\n\nWe can use `global()` to select across all global resources, but cannot limit this to just GlobalNetworkSets. We can use an external policy agent, like OPA or kyverno, to disallow setting our networkset labels on resources that are not network sets but this requires an additional system to be deployed.\n\n## Possible Solution\n<!--- Not obligatory, but suggest a fix/reason for the bug, -->\n<!--- or ideas how to implement the addition or change -->\n\nCalico could automatically add a new label, e.g. `projectcalico.org/kind` to each calico resource so that we can select resources by kind and their labels within the same selector. In our case, we could write a selector like `networking.our.internal.stuff/networkset == \"some-name\" && projectcalico.org/kind == \"GlobalNetworkSet\"`\n\nAnother solution would be something like a `kind(GlobalNetworkSet)` expression that does the same, but does not require an extra label.\n\n## Context\n<!--- How has this issue affected you? What are you trying to accomplish? -->\n<!--- Providing context helps us come up with a solution that is most useful in the real world -->\n\nWe want to be as strict as possible in our network policies and close any potential loophole that might exist in our setup.\n",

Their labels are not. It is possible to add the same label to two different network sets potentially allowing much more than expected. Something like `kind(GlobalNetworkSet) && name(Something)` as an expression would perfectly express what we want without allowing any potential misconfiguration.\n\nAgain, we can work around this using additional tooling (VAP/OPA/Kyverno) that verifies that the value of our `networking.our.internal.stuff/networkset` label exactly matches the name of a global network set, but built-in support for more precision when declaring network policies would be really nice!", "Hey guys,\n\nI'd love to try and work on this one. Do you have a general advice where I should start with this?", "Thanks @ivnhk ! \n\nI'd start by familiarizing yourself with how to build and run Calico and its tests. There's a general contribution guide here: https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md (although I'll admit, it might be a tad out of date...)\n\nYou might also want to poke around to see how the (very similar) `orchestrator` label is handled for kubernetes pods. Here's a hint: https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/blob/f3da524b7c6e4cfdf9874b2cddd0233213a1d8f3/libcalico-go/lib/backend/k8s/conversion/workload_endpoint_default.go#L163\n\nWe convert pods into an internal type called \"WorkloadEndpoint\" and when we do, we force a label to be set on it for selection. \n\nFor NetworkSets, you could probably do something similar - or even better since it's an API that we control, you could also add it to the defaulting and validation code for that API - here are some hints on that part:\n\n- https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/blob/master/libcalico-go/lib/clientv3/networkset.go\n- https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/blob/f3da524b7c6e4cfdf9874b2cddd0233213a1d8f3/libcalico-go/lib/validator/v3/validator.go#L269-L270 " ],

      "description" : "## Bug Report\n\nPlease answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\n\n### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)\n\n1.  Open https://www.kcl-lang.io/ on a mobile device (or resize your browser window to a mobile viewport width).\n2.  Scroll down to the \"Subscribe to Newsletter\" section.\n\n### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)\n\nThe email input field and the \"SUBSCRIBE\" button should ideally be horizontally aligned, or at least optimized for a tidier and more integrated appearance on mobile screens.\n\n### 3. What did you see instead (Required)\n\nThe email input field and the \"SUBSCRIBE\" button are currently displayed vertically (one above the other), resulting in an untidy and less integrated appearance on mobile devices.\n\n**Screenshots:**\n**Current Mobile Layout:**\n<img width=\"120\" alt=\"Mobile - before\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0a8aba4-28e1-4d38-81b5-b3877e3c110a\" />\n*Description:* Shows the input field and button stacked vertically.\n\n### 4. What is your KCL components version? (Required)\n\nN/A. This issue pertains to the User Interface (UI) of the `kcl-lang.io` website on mobile, not to a KCL component or runtime.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Information\n\nI have a local fix that adjusts the CSS/layout of the subscribe form to align the email input field and the \"SUBSCRIBE\" button horizontally on mobile viewports. This change significantly improves the form's appearance and responsiveness.\n\n**Screenshot of Proposed Layout (Local Fix Example):**\n<img width=\"120\" alt=\"Mobile - after\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab312215-2880-4d00-9fb8-16e539437abd\" />\n*Description:* Shows the input field and button horizontally aligned, demonstrating a cleaner look.\n\nI am ready to open a Pull Request (PR) with the proposed changes if this improvement is a good fit for the project. Please let me know if you would like me to proceed with a PR.\n\nThank you for your consideration.",

      "description" : "## Background\nThe PID class is a base implementation for lots of controllers. Therefore, we should thrive for full test coverage\n\nHaving a look at the [coverage report](https://app.codecov.io/gh/ros-controls/control_toolbox/tree/ros2-master/control_toolbox), we see that some methods have no coverage, e.g., \n\n- `void PidROS::reset()`\n- `void PidROS::reset(bool save_i_term)`\n- `double PidROS::compute_command(double error, double error_dot, const rclcpp::Duration & dt)`\n- `void PidROS::set_current_cmd(double cmd) { pid_.set_current_cmd(cmd); }`\n- `double PidROS::get_current_cmd() { return pid_.get_current_cmd(); }`\n- `void PidROS::print_values()`\n\nand in general, we have little coverage in testing the input validations.\n\nImprove that by additional tests/test-cases.\n\n## Instructions\nHi, this is a `good-first-issue` issue. This means we've worked to make it more legible to people who either **haven't contributed to our codebase before, or even folks who haven't contributed to open source before**.\n\nWe're interested in helping you take the first step, and can answer questions and help you out along the way. Note that we're especially interested in contributions from underrepresented groups!\n\nWe know that creating a pull request is the biggest barrier for new contributors. This issue is for you \uD83D\uDC9D\n\nIf you have contributed before, **consider leaving this PR for someone new**, and looking through our general [bug](https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_control/labels/bug) issues. Thanks!\n\n### \uD83E\uDD14 What you will need to know.\n\nNothing. This issue is meant to welcome you to Open Source :) We are happy to walk you through the process.\n\n### \uD83D\uDCCB Step by Step\n\n- [ ] \uD83D\uDE4B **Claim this issue**: Comment below. If someone else has claimed it, ask if they've opened a pull request already and if they're stuck -- maybe you can help them solve a problem or move it along!\n\n- [ ] \uD83D\uDDC4️ **Create a local workspace** for making your changes and testing [following these instructions](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Tutorials/Workspace/Creating-A-Workspace.html), for Step 3 use \"Download Source Code\" section with [these instructions](https://control.ros.org/master/doc/getting_started/getting_started.html#building-from-source).\n\n- [ ] \uD83C\uDF74 **Fork the repository** using the handy button at the top of the repository page and **clone** it into `~/ws_ros2_control/src/ros-controls/ros2_control`, [here is a guide that you can follow](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) (You will have to remove or empty the existing `ros2_control` folder before cloning your own fork)\n\n- [ ] **Checkout a new branch** using `git checkout -b <branch_name>`\n\n- [ ] \uD83E\uDD16 **Apply `pre-commit`** auto formatting, by running `pip3 install pre-commit` and running `pre-commit install` in the ros2_control repo.\n\n- [ ] \uD83D\uDCBE **Commit and Push** your changes\n\n- [ ] \uD83D\uDD00 **Start a Pull Request** to request to merge your code into `master`. There are two ways that you can start a pull request:\n1. If you are not familiar with GitHub or how to create a pull request, [here is a guide you can follow](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) on how GitHub works.\n\n- [ ] \uD83C\uDFC1 **Done** Ask in comments for a review :)\n\n### Is someone else already working on this?\n\n\uD83D\uDD17- We encourage contributors to link to the original issue in their pull request so all users can easily see if someone's already started on it.\n\n\uD83D\uDC65- **If someone seems stuck, offer them some help!**\n\n### \uD83E\uDD14❓ Questions?\n\nDon’t hesitate to ask questions or to get help if you feel like you are getting stuck. For example leave a comment below!\nFurthermore, you find helpful resources here:\n* [ROS2 Control Contribution Guide](https://control.ros.org/master/doc/contributing/contributing.html)\n* [ROS2 Tutorials](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Tutorials.html)\n* [Robotics Stack Exchange](https://robotics.stackexchange.com)\n\n**Good luck with your first issue!**\n",

For example, link to version 1.7 could initially point to the main downloads page and later redirect to the archive page. Or, whether we need to create stable links for each version\n\uD83E\uDDE9 Code Changes\n\t• Confirm that the correct major and minor version numbers are accessible—or can be made accessible—in code at the point where the error dialog is invoked (see [Initialize_OnError_ShowUI](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK/blob/5ce1f09f8ed314dd647c12be1d910ef894645168/dev/Deployment/DeploymentManager.cpp#L661) and [MddBootstrapInitialize_ShowUI_OnNoMatch](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK/blob/5ce1f09f8ed314dd647c12be1d910ef894645168/dev/WindowsAppRuntime_BootstrapDLL/MddBootstrap.cpp#L1153))\n\t• Construct a version-specific URL using the major and minor version numbers and pass it to the ShellExecute call.\n\uD83D\uDD2E Future-Proofing\n\t• Consider fallback behavior if a version-specific link is unavailable (low priority)." ],

We think that KubeStellar works in more configurations, and they should be tested.\r\n\r\n- Things other than `kind` providing Kubernetes clusters.\r\n- The WDS and/or ITS role played by the hosting cluster.\r\n- The WDS and/or ITS role played by some other pre-existing cluster.\r\n- One new ControlPlane playing both ITS and WDS roles.\r\n\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nDo something. Without expanding the gating CI tests too much (note: I am not asserting exactly how much is too much).\n\n### Want to contribute?\n\n- [ ] I would like to work on this issue.\n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_",

Expected result\n\nFor certain libraries like MUI, we have imports purely for type augmentation like this:\n\n```ts\nimport type {} from '@mui/lab/themeAugmentation';\n```\n\nWe use `import type {}` so that it will only utilize the type information and nothing else during bundling.\n\nIn Biome v1 there was no error, but Biome v2 triggers an error for `lint/correctness/noUnusedImports` and the fixer actually removes the statement which causes other issues. \n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow Biome's Code of Conduct",

Schema Refactor (Supabase)\n- Identify all instances of `owner_id` across the Supabase schema (tables, relationships, foreign keys).\n- Rename the columns to `kinder_id`, preserving existing constraints.\n- Create a properly versioned SQL migration file using Supabase CLI and place it under `services/supabase/migrations/`.\n- Validate database consistency after the rename through Supabase CLI and dashboard tools.\n\n### 2. Backend Adjustments (`services/supabase`)\n- Refactor all code references to `owner_id` across query logic, types, and service utilities.\n- Ensure all affected endpoints and mutations behave as expected with the updated schema.\n\n### 3. Frontend Integration (`apps/web`)\n- Update Supabase queries, types, and hooks that reference `owner_id`.\n- Refactor relevant components or forms handling project ownership or user metadata.\n- Run and update any impacted unit tests or mocks accordingly.\n\n### 4. Documentation\n- Update schema diagrams, ERD references, and technical documentation under `docs/` to reflect the updated field naming and align with project terminology.\n\n###  Deliverables\n- Fully working PR with schema + code changes.\n- A Supabase CLI-compatible SQL migration script.\n- Clear changelog and commit breakdown.\n- Optional: Schema diff or notes for internal dev reference.\n\n**ETA:** I estimate 36–48 hours for full implementation, testing, and documentation updates.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to take it! \nHappy to help standardize and improve the DB structure.\n", "# Hi there, @4c1d-V \uD83D\uDC4B You've been assigned this issue.\n\nOne invite is waiting for you in your email.

For Windows users, you need to install `sudo` to execute commands with elevated privileges. Here are the steps to install `sudo` on Windows:\n\n### Installing `sudo` on Windows\n\n1. **Using Chocolatey:**\n   - If you don't have Chocolatey installed, you can install it by following the instructions on the [Chocolatey website](https://chocolatey.org/install).\n   - Once Chocolatey is installed, open a command prompt as an administrator and run:\n     ```bash\n     choco install gsudo\n     ```\n\n2. **Using Scoop:**\n   - If you don't have Scoop installed, you can install it by following the instructions on the [Scoop website](https://scoop.sh/).\n   - Once Scoop is installed, open a command prompt as an administrator and run:\n     ```bash\n     scoop install gsudo\n     ```\n\n3. **Using WinGet:**\n   - If you don't have WinGet installed, you can install it by following the instructions on the [WinGet website](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli).\n   - Once WinGet is installed, open a command prompt as an administrator and run:\n     ```bash\n     winget install gerardog.gsudo\n     ```\n\n## Installation Instructions for KubeFlex\n\n1. **Download the KubeFlex CLI:**\n   - Download the latest KubeFlex CLI binary release for your OS/Architecture from the [release page](https://github.com/kubestellar/kubeflex/releases) and copy it to `/usr/local/bin` or another location in your `$PATH`.\n\n   For example, on Linux amd64:\n   ```bash\n   OS_ARCH=linux_amd64\n   LATEST_RELEASE_URL=\\$(curl -H \"Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json\" https://api.github.com/repos/kubestellar/kubeflex/releases/latest | jq -r '.assets[] | select(.name | contains(\"linux_amd64\")) | .browser_download_url')\n   sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 <(curl -L \\$LATEST_RELEASE_URL) /usr/local/bin/kfle\n\n\n2.**Alternative Installation Command:**\nYou can also use the following command, which will automatically detect the host OS type and architecture:\n\n```\nsudo bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubestellar/kubeflex/main/scripts/install-kubeflex.sh) --ensure-folder /usr/local/bin\n\n```\n", "@Krishna-mishra-26 ty for your help here.

This means that, when executing the `createapp` command, new projects generated with this command use ESLint.\r\n\r\nBut the framework monorepo itself has not yet been migrated to ESLint. This is a technical debt that should be resolved.\r\n\r\n# Guidelines\r\n\r\n- ~If [this PR](https://github.com/FoalTS/foal/pull/1260), which updates the way dependencies are managed in monorepo, has not yet been merged, the new branch should be created from `v4-5-0`. Otherwise, it should be created from `master`. Not only will this facilitate the migration to ESLint, it will also avoid the need for additional work later on to manage ESLint dependencies with the new dependency system.~\r\n- Migration to ESLint should not change the style of the framework code (we don't want thousands of line changes to commit). A lot of work had been done at the time in [this PR](https://github.com/FoalTS/foal/pull/561) to make ESLint rules consistent with TSLint rules. There's probably a lot to be learned from this PR.\r\n- When opening the framework repository with VSCode with the ESLint plugin enabled, VSCode should correctly highlight ESLint errors and correct them when saving (if the plugin is configurer to do so).\r\n\r\n# Notes\r\n\r\n- There *might* be useful information [here](https://typescript-eslint.io/getting-started/typed-linting/monorepos/).\r\n- The files `packages/cli/src/generate/specs/app/.eslintrc.js` and `packages/cli/src/generate/templates/app/.eslintrc.js` used by `foal createapp` to generate new projects may cause problems.",

I'll let you choose what you think is the best solution.\n\nThe ideal solution where we want to go is this:\n- the method used in the monorepo framework should be the same as that used in new projects generated by `foal createapp`,\n- and the linting rules used in the monorepo framework should be the same as those used in new projects generated by `foal createapp`.\n\nIn this way, when we write documentation and copy-paste code from the framework, the examples are always correctly “linted” when users then copy-paste the same code into their projects.\n\n**Note 1:** if we have this ideal solution with the same rules and the `createapp` rules are still the same and there are linting errors that appear from the framework code, then we can fix them all. Go for it \uD83D\uDC4D \n\n**Note 2:** in tests of the directory `acceptance-tests/`, there are pieces of code that are between comments such as `======== DOCUMENTATION BEGIN =======` and `====== DOCUMENTATION END =======`. In this case, this means that these codes are present in the documentation and should be updated as well in the markdowns in case of modification. You can ignore files in `docs/versioned_docs/` and `docs/i18n/`.\n\nThank you so much, for taking care of this.

      "description" : "1.8+ has a Chinese localization. We may have others contributed in the future. It would be useful to provide some type of automation around identifying:\n\n1. what en.yml strings do not have a corresponding localization for zh-CN.yml (what keys in en.yml do not exist in zh-CN.yml)\n1. what keys in zh-CN.yml do not exist in en.yml - these would be old keys in zh-CN.yml that may need removed, or they are misspelled keys\n1. if an en.yml string gets updated/modified, to flag which strings in zh-CN.yml need updated (this requires a clever git blame to determine the line number in the YAML file where a key starts and ensure the commit date of zh-CN.yml for a given key is greater than the commit date for the same key in en.yml. if en.yml is later that indicates that for this key the translation has been updated or modified and may need to be updated or modified for zh-CN. NOTE: a problem with this is if there is a false positive... like we fix a typo in the English or word it better but the Chinese is good and needs no update.. we could figure that out later). Could use https://www.rubydoc.info/github/libgit2/rugged/Rugged/Blame for this\n1. what strings in the application have not be internationalized (these strings are hardcoded)\n\nThere are many tools and approaches for this, but we want to keep deployment simple. The yaml files mean the translations stay with the code which is nice. Could probably use `for_line`. This also might encourage us to avoid multi-line strings in the locale files.\n\nMaybe a rake task is sufficient to start.\n\nAlso worth searching for existing tools that might assist with this as an alternative to writing our own.\n\n┆Issue is synchronized with this [Asana task](https://app.asana.com/0/1202821104799596/1204178484951391) by [Unito](https://www.unito.io)\n",

There are also tools like https://github.com/pejuko/i18n-translators-tools to convert the default Rails yaml into other formats for easier translation. We could also consider future versions of OnDemand using gettext. gettext doesn't use keys like the Rails yaml does, and just takes the full sentence and provides a translation for it. Most TMS support this out of the box, though there may also be examples of TMS projects that work with the Rails yaml formats. Another benefit of the gettext PO format is that its language/framework independent so if at some point we drop Rails or still have a mixture of Rails and other language/framework for apps in OnDemand, or want to translate error strings in Apache and/or NGINX as well, we can handle all of that in an language independent way.\r\n\r\nExamples: http://pootle.translatehouse.org/, http://zanata.org/ (RedHat product with free open source project support)\r\n\r\nSearch for \"open source translation management systems\" to see many options.", "Still thinking about this.

This is because the input file is repeatedly converted to and from JSON objects, meaning line number info is discarded.\n\n### Proposed fix\nEvery warning/error has a JSONPath reference associated with it. \nIt may be simpler to simply find that JSONPath in the file and report the line/char number from there.\n\nFailing that, we need to properly propagate the whitespace through the document as we validate it.",

Second, the example-wecs page's source is _included_ into the quickstart setup page, at https://docs.kubestellar.io/unreleased-development/direct/get-started/#create-and-register-two-workload-execution-clusters , so that is where I think the reader should be directed.", "@benzha14: Please look at https://docs.kubestellar.io/unreleased-development/direct/example-scenarios/ again, particularly the first sentence in https://docs.kubestellar.io/unreleased-development/direct/example-scenarios/#assumptions-and-variables and the other remarks in that section about the label selectors, now that #2316 has merged.", "ok.

For any other setup, different values are needed in general.", "@benzha14: I am concerned that putting a display in https://docs.kubestellar.io/unreleased-development/direct/example-scenarios/ that displays the settings for https://docs.kubestellar.io/unreleased-development/direct/get-started/ would be problematic because they become detached from their context, it becomes not so clear _why_ each setting is the right setting. When displayed right next to the definitions of the variables, the exhibited settings take on an air of authority that is unwarranted, and users start to suppose that the exhibited settings are the right ones in general and become hesitant to use any other values (regardless of any explicit statement that may be present).", "What I have done instead is put in a link that is easy to follow.

      "url" : "https://github.com/onnx/onnx/issues/7100",
      "repositoryName" : "onnx/onnx",
      "description" : "### System information\n\nTop of tree.\n\n### What is the problem that this feature solves?\n\nCurrently, ONNX’s `shape_inference.infer_shapes` API performs both type and shape inference simultaneously. Type inference is guaranteed in a valid model, but shape inference is on \"best effort\" basis. For some operators (e.g., GridSample, Gather, Reshape, Where, etc), shape inference may fail due to incomplete or complex shape logic, even when type inference could succeed. \nThis tight coupling prevents users from recovering type information when shape inference is unsupported or fails. For example, when users attempt to inject cast nodes or quantize nodes and propagate the type information downstream.\n\n\n**Request:**\nPlease consider adding an option to ONNX’s shape inference API to:\n- Run type inference independently of shape inference, so that type information can be propagated even when shape inference fails or is not implemented for an operator.\n- Alternatively, relax the requirement that shape inference must succeed for type inference to run.\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Enables users and downstream tools to recover and validate type information in more models, improving robustness and usability.\n- Reduces manual workarounds (such as manually setting types for affected nodes).\n- Makes ONNX models more portable and easier to analyze, even when shape logic is incomplete.\n\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n1. Create a separate function to support only type inference `infer_types` (preferable) \n2. Add boolean argument `check_shape=True` to the existing `infer_shapes` API (renaming the function is advisable in this case, `infer_shapes_and_types` or similar).\n\n\n### Describe the feature\n\nDecouple type inference from shape inference.\n\n\n### Will this influence the current api (Y/N)?\n\nDepends on the alternative selected. \nCan maintain backwards compatiblity.\n\n### Feature Area\n\nshape_inference\n\n### Are you willing to contribute it (Y/N)\n\nNone\n\n### Notes\n\nRelated issues https://github.com/onnx/onnx/issues/4934",

The comment above `self.param` may also be relevant here.\n\n### Version\n\nty 0.0.1-alpha.11",

      "comments" : [ "Thank you very much for reporting this — and for the initial analysis.\n\nWe're currently not recognizing a declaration-only annotated assignment (without a right-hand side) such as `self.param: Type` as evidence for an instance attribute:\n```py\nclass C:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.a: int\n\n\nC().a  # unresolved-attribute\n```\nhttps://play.ty.dev/812a2e90-7b5f-4865-a3d6-daad7fa6a4bf\n\nThis is a known limitation (see the `TODO` for `declared_only` in [this test case](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/cb152b47253182df9bbd19a93a700e90060774cb/crates/ty_python_semantic/resources/mdtest/attributes.md#variable-only-declaredbound-in-__init__)).", "This could probably be a good (but not too easy) task for interested contributors, with a relatively limited scope (?). Instead of only considering bindings for attribute assignments, we need to consider both bindings and declarations. Declarations are already correctly recorded in the semantic index, but in type inference, we currently only access the bindings. The patch below may be useful as a reference to see which places in the source code need to change. It switches everything from bindings-only to declarations-only (which would fix the issue here), but of course that needs to be extended to consider both.\n\nJust like when resolving references to normal variables, declarations should take precedence over bindings. That is, even if we see conflicting definitions such as `self.x: int` and `self.x = \"a string\"`, the type of the `x` attribute should just be `int`.\n\n<details>\n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/semantic_index.rs b/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/semantic_index.rs\nindex d4f848e69d..9be2b157d7 100644\n--- a/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/semantic_index.rs\n+++ b/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/semantic_index.rs\n@@ -108,7 +108,7 @@ pub(crate) fn attribute_assignments<'db, 's>(\n     db: &'db dyn Db,\n     class_body_scope: ScopeId<'db>,\n     name: &'s str,\n-) -> impl Iterator<Item = (BindingWithConstraintsIterator<'db, 'db>, FileScopeId)> + use<'s, 'db> {\n+) -> impl Iterator<Item = (DeclarationsIterator<'db, 'db>, FileScopeId)> + use<'s, 'db> {\n     let file = class_body_scope.file(db);\n     let index = semantic_index(db, file);\n \n@@ -116,7 +116,7 @@ pub(crate) fn attribute_assignments<'db, 's>(\n         let place_table = index.place_table(function_scope_id);\n         let place = place_table.place_id_by_instance_attribute_name(name)?;\n         let use_def = &index.use_def_maps[function_scope_id];\n-        Some((use_def.public_bindings(place), function_scope_id))\n+        Some((use_def.public_declarations(place), function_scope_id))\n     })\n }\n \ndiff --git a/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/semantic_index/use_def.rs b/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/semantic_index/use_def.rs\nindex 8ac7f91811..978ce2de7a 100644\n--- a/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/semantic_index/use_def.rs\n+++ b/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/semantic_index/use_def.rs\n@@ -463,10 +463,10 @@ impl<'db> UseDefMap<'db> {\n             .is_always_false()\n     }\n \n-    pub(crate) fn is_binding_reachable(\n+    pub(crate) fn is_declaration_reachable(\n         &self,\n         db: &dyn crate::Db,\n-        binding: &BindingWithConstraints<'_, 'db>,\n+        binding: &DeclarationWithConstraint<'db>,\n     ) -> Truthiness {\n         self.reachability_constraints.evaluate(\n             db,\ndiff --git a/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/types/class.rs b/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/types/class.rs\nindex 3cd7bffa5b..371291a94a 100644\n--- a/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/types/class.rs\n+++ b/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/types/class.rs\n@@ -1744,10 +1744,10 @@ impl<'db> ClassLiteral<'db> {\n                     let method = index.expect_single_definition(method_def);\n                     let method_place = class_table.place_id_by_name(&method_def.name).unwrap();\n                     class_map\n-                        .public_bindings(method_place)\n-                        .find_map(|bind| {\n-                            (bind.binding.is_defined_and(|def| def == method))\n-                                .then(|| class_map.is_binding_reachable(db, &bind))\n+                        .public_declarations(method_place)\n+                        .find_map(|decl| {\n+                            (decl.declaration.is_defined_and(|def| def == method))\n+                                .then(|| class_map.is_declaration_reachable(db, &decl))\n                         })\n                         .unwrap_or(Truthiness::AlwaysFalse)\n                 } else {\n@@ -1762,7 +1762,7 @@ impl<'db> ClassLiteral<'db> {\n             let mut unbound_binding = None;\n \n             for attribute_assignment in attribute_assignments {\n-                if let DefinitionState::Undefined = attribute_assignment.binding {\n+                if let DefinitionState::Undefined = attribute_assignment.declaration {\n                     // Store the implicit unbound binding here so that we can delay the\n                     // computation of `unbound_reachability` to the point when we actually\n                     // need it.

It switches everything from bindings-only to declarations-only, which would fix the issue here.",

This limits the reach and visibility of the content, making it harder for readers to promote the blogs organically to a broader audience.\n\n### How will this change help?\n\nThis change will ease the sharing of blog amongst social platforms.\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### How could it be implemented/designed?\n\nAdd social sharing buttons to each blog post. These buttons should allow users to share the post on popular platforms such as:\n\n    Twitter\n    LinkedIn\n\nEach button should generate a pre-filled sharing link, including the blog post title, URL, and possibly hashtags. For example:\n\n```Twitter: https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Check+out+this+blog!&url=https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/2024-annual-summary#social-media```\n\nThe buttons should be visually appealing, lightweight, and non-intrusive. They can be displayed at the top or bottom of each blog post.\n\n### \uD83D\uDEA7 Breaking changes\n\nYes\n\n### \uD83D\uDC40 Have you checked for similar open issues?\n\n- [x] I checked and didn't find a similar issue\n\n### \uD83C\uDFE2 Have you read the Contributing Guidelines?\n\n- [x] I have read the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/asyncapi/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n### Are you willing to work on this issue?\n\nYes I am willing to submit a PR!",

Remeda is a **TypeScript** utility library that assumes the types in the project are sound.\n\ne.g. \n\n```ts\n// @ts-expect-error\nconst x: string = null;\n\n// This would throw, it has nothing to do with Remeda\nx.toLowerCase();\n```\n\nRemeda is not a replacement for a runtime type-validation library like https://zod.dev/, which could be used to improve the confidence that the types in your project are accurate." ],

For example, While we create project on Field-TM for Suryodaya municipality, which lies near the border, the project showed different country. However, creating project with same AOI on tasking manager, which use nominatim, shows correct country name. \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b9b4760-10a6-489b-bde8-89a189d0c983)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fc1a135-e629-4a03-abe1-222b56def46f)", "Thats a really interesting point!\n\nIs the AOI geographically closer to Shri Antu, Nepal than to Mirik, India?\n\nWe can solve this - thanks for pointing out - its literally matching to the closest city of 1000 people, disregarding country borders (when we should probably respect country borders as higher priority)", "I am not sure of the geographic proximity but I agree country borders should be high in order. ", "Also the country naming differs from Nominatim (for example: U.S and United States).Since the filters and charts use the Nominatim name, If we plan to integrate it, we'll need to run a script on the production database to update the names accordingly and also make other api and frontend changes too i suppose.

I wonder if that would be possible (maybe needs db changes, like you say).\n\nEither way, we have an intern starting for a few weeks that may be able to dig into these things for pg-nearest-city.

Since swift-syntax can't depend on swift-testing (which would incur a circular dependency since swift-testing depends on swift-syntax), users need to manually specify a failure handler like the following, that fails the swift-testing test: `Issue.record(\"\\($0.message)\", fileID: $0.location.fileID, filePath: $0.location.filePath, line: $0.location.line, column: $0.location.column)`\n> - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2647\n\n\nThe SwiftPM template for `swift package init --type macro` should be update to provide an idiomatic way to write a Swift Testing test to verify and validate a macro.\n\n",

The 0.24 blog post has/will have some instructions on how to do this, so it should be easy for anyone to do. If you want to contribute something relatively small feel free to update one (or more) and make a pull request. A rough list of easy plots/recipes:\n- [ ] arc\n- [ ] band\n- [ ] pie\n- [ ] poly\n- [ ] stairs\n- [ ] stem\n- [ ] tooltip\n- [ ] wireframe\n- [ ] density\n- [ ] qqplot (distributions.jl)\n- [ ] stephist\n- [ ] hist\n- [ ] timeseries\n- [ ] series\n\nSome recipes still use `register_computation!()` when they could use `map!()`. This should be a fairly easy cleanup/replacement as well.\n- [ ] tricontourf\n- [ ] spy\n- [ ] scatterlines\n\nSome recipes may require some more refactoring, like breaking up an `onany` that updates multiple observables. They should still be fairly easy to translate (though I haven't checked in depth). `contourf` or `errorbars` might be an instructive example.\n- [ ] arrows\n- [ ] barplot\n- [ ] contour\n- [ ] triplot\n- [ ] waterfall\n- [ ] boxplot\n- [ ] crossbar\n- [ ] hexbin\n- [ ] violin\n\nSome recipes apply transformations and projections. These should probably be delayed a bit, as we can/should extend what's happening for primitive plots to recipe plots here\n- ~~hlines, vlines, hspan, vspan (+ limit tracking)~~\n- [ ] annotation (+ bbox handling)\n- [ ] bracket\n- [ ] streamplot (or maybe refactor rotation handling?)\n- [ ] textlabel\n- [ ] voronoiplot\n\nOther:\n- [ ] volumeslices (how do we want to handle the transformation system)\n\nNot sure if done:\n- [ ] axis3d (maybe needs full rework?)\n- [ ] datashader\n- [ ] rainclouds",

      "description" : "# GPU Support for the Ersilia Model Hub\n\n## Background\n\nCurrently, the Ersilia Model Hub does not support GPU acceleration, which limits the performance of some models — and makes others completely unusable. Models are currently packaged as CPU-only Docker images. The goal of this project is to evaluate and implement GPU support using Docker.\n\n## Goals\n\n- Demonstrate that a model can run inside a Docker container with GPU access.\n- Build the foundation to support GPU in the Ersilia infrastructure (template, CLI, metadata, CI/CD).\n- Benchmark performance between CPU and GPU runs.\n\n## Step 1: Manual GPU Docker Test (Top-Down)\n\nWe will first verify that models can run in a GPU-enabled Docker container, without relying on Ersilia's internal infrastructure (e.g., CLI or model template).\n\n- [ ] Select two test models:\n  - [ ] One **GPU-only** model (TBD).\n  - [ ] One **GPU/CPU-compatible** model (suggested: FAISS-based).\n- [ ] Set up the new GPU workstation.\n- [ ] Choose and test an appropriate CUDA base image (e.g., `nvidia/cuda:...`).\n- [ ] Ensure image size is acceptable (<~4GB ideally).\n- [ ] Run tests on:\n  - [ ] At least two local GPU workstations.\n  - [ ] One cloud instance (e.g., AWS GPU instance).\n\n## Step 2: Integrate GPU Support into Ersilia Infrastructure\n\n### \uD83E\uDDF1 At the [Ersilia Template](https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos-template) level\n\n- [ ] How should `install.yml` indicate GPU requirements?\n- [ ] If model code differs between CPU/GPU, how should this be reflected in the `framework/`?\n\n### ⚙️ At the [Ersilia CLI](https://github.com/ersilia-os/ersilia) level\n\n- [ ] Add support for `--gpu` or `--cpu` flags in the `ersilia serve` command.\n- [ ] Decide whether GPU/CPU mode should be:\n  - Explicit (user-defined via flag), or\n  - Automatic (detect from hardware?)\n- [ ] Assess: Can one image support both CPU and GPU, or do we need separate ones?\n\n### \uD83D\uDCE6 At the [Ersilia Metadata](https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos5axz/blob/main/metadata.json) level\n\n- [ ] Add `runtime: GPU` / `CPU` or similar field.\n- [ ] Consider `requirements` or `compatibility` sections if needed.\n\n### \uD83D\uDC33 On [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/ersiliaos)\n\n- [ ] Should GPU-compatible images use a separate tag (e.g., `model:gpu`) or separate repo?\n- [ ] Define tagging convention early.\n\n## Step 3: GitHub Actions & CI Integration\n\nIn the [Ersilia Model Workflows](https://github.com/ersilia-os/ersilia-model-workflows):\n\n- [ ] Detect whether a model supports GPU.\n- [ ] Build and push a GPU-compatible Docker image (using `nvidia-docker`).\n- [ ] Ensure existing workflows are not broken.\n\nIn the [Ersilia CLI CI/CD](https://github.com/ersilia-os/ersilia):\n\n- [ ] Add at least one unit test to check GPU execution (on GitHub-hosted runners or self-hosted runner with GPU).\n\n## Step 4: Benchmarking & Validation\n\n- [ ] Run performance benchmarks:\n  - CPU vs GPU execution time.\n  - Memory consumption and constraints.\n- [ ] Record any limitations or environment-specific requirements.",

There might be more than one GPU in a device and either we have to select one device or sharding tasks accross all available GPUs\n- [x] not only nvidia binary but also other accelerators.", "- [x] Set up the new GPU workstation.\n\n- [ ] Select two test models:\n\n   - [ ] One GPU-only model \n\n   - [x] One GPU/CPU-compatible model (suggested: FAISS-based).\n\n- [x] Choose and test an appropriate CUDA base image (e.g., nvidia/cuda:...).\n\n\n## CUDA Base Image: \n\nNvidia has 3 \"flavours\" images `base`, `runtime` and `devel`. `runtime` seems to be the most appropriate for our use case, necessary runtime and Mathematics Libraries, NCCL and optionally cudNN. For example : \n\n```nvidia/cuda:12.9.0-runtime-ubuntu24.04```\n\nThis comes to ~ 2 GB/3 GB depending on the exact CUDA and Ubuntu Version being used. \n\nIdeally run automated tests/builds for different combinations of Ubuntu (or other distributions?) and CUDA  versions. \n\n## CPU vs GPU preliminary testing\n\nA very simple test on TabPFN using a [Sci-Kit Learn Breast Cancer Dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html) showed approximately 3x-4x speed ups when GPU access to the process was enabled, compared to CPU only runs (on the Norrsken GPU Workstation).\n\nMore detailed tests using a [Dataset of approximately 2 Million Compounds](https://github.com/ersilia-os/sars-cov-2-chemspace/blob/main/data/reference_library_inchikeys.csv) showed overwhelming speed-ups with GPU Accelerated similarity searches using [FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss), the difference between search times of GPU and CPU implementations scaled/diverged with the Index size. **It is clearly worth trying to accelerate models using GPU Acceleration.**\n\nWe built indices out of Count Fingerprints of the compounds (converted the SMILES to 2048 Vectors). Cosine Similarity was used as a metric. \n\nFAISS does not support cosine by default, so we use  an `Inner Product` index and perform L2 (Euclidean) Normalisation on the vectors before adding to them to the index (or before searching), which is the equivalent of using Cosine similarity.\n\nTests were ran with index sizes of `10,000`, `100,000`, `500,000` and `1,000,000`. Nearest 100 Neighbours. \n\n### Index size 100,000:\n| Number of Searches | CPU (s) | GPU (s) |\n|--------------------|---------|---------|\n| 100                | 1       | 0.01    |\n| 1,000              | 7.08    | 0.04    |\n| 10,000             | 67.49   | 0.11    |\n| 100,000            | >350    | 1.30    |\n| 500,000            | -       | 5.50    |\n\n### Index size 1,000,000\n\n| Number of Searches | CPU (s) | GPU (s) |\n|--------------------|---------|---------|\n| 100                | 9.42    | 0.02    |\n| 1,000              | 71      | 0.10    |\n| 10,000             | 711     | 1.03    |\n| 100,000            | -       | 10.45   |\n| 500,000            | -       | 52.50   |\n\n\n\n### \n\n<img width=\"765\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e39adae0-7c06-43ba-ba5f-3da89037da02\" />\n\n_NOTE: GPUs are typically higher latency but have higher parallel throughput and memory bandwidth than CPUs. It is best to use batch queries with the CPU or GPU as this amortises the touching of index memory across all of the queries and this is when GPU speed ups are convenient. We will most likely not see any improvements in GPU search times with single queries (if anything it might be slower because of GPU overhead)._\n\n\nThe examples of inference time comparisons and a 3D plot (inference time against index and query sizes), clearly demonstrate **GPUs provide absolutely non-trivial speed ups for the right tasks.**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "# Very Heavy Index (FAISS Flat)\n\nFlat (IP and L2 for example) indices are extremely large (because FAISS only supports Float32 vectors, hence each Fingerprint vector is 32 * 2048 = 65,536 Bits or 4 * 2048=8,192  Bytes), scaling up to millions of vectors means we are dealing with indices that are 10s of GBs.\n\nTried FPSim2 but there are no benefits to GPU accelerating since it does not support batch queries (could be worth looking into CUDA Programming and tuning it to support batch queries, as it supports Sparse Vectors and Tanimoto Search on GPU)\n\n## Promising alternative to Flat FAISS Index: **Approximate Nearest Neighbour (ANN) search**\n\nMost methods for ANN require index training and parameter tuning which makes building the index more complex. We also need to ensure that the training sample is diverse. \n\nPlease note the difference between training and adding to Indices. And index cannot be trained incrementally but can be incrementally added to.\n\nMemory bottlenecks are also an issue so I first train the index and then add vectors to it incrementally in batches. (Although, it is suggested, If possible at all,  add more compute at index build time. (Especially if the index does not change a lot over time))\n\nThe following ANN methods are explored and suggested (compared to ~16 GB with a flat index of around 1.99 million Vectors)\n\n### **_IVFPQ (Inverted File Index with Product Quantisation):_** \n\n#### **_I am yet to do Accuracy tests on IVFPQ but with computational performance (inference time), models seem to enjoy GPU Acceleration speed ups similar to those mentioned above for FAISS Flat indices._**\n\nThis creates very light indices: `~93 MB for an index of around 1.99 Million Vectors`, but there might be a non-trivial loss of accuracy. \n\nNote: For some reason after the index is trained and incrementally built, FAISS takes a lot of time to write it to disk which makes it look like the process is frozen but isn't actually frozen - it goes into an \"uninterruptible sleep\" because of Disk IO, as indicated by the \"D\" state in htop. \n\n### **_HNSWSQ (Hierarchical Navigable Small World Index with Scalar Quantisation)_**\n\nTraining is reasonably fast (with GPU) but adding vectors is computationally intensive and needs to batched appropriately.\n\n#### **_I am yet to do Accuracy tests on HNSWSQ but with computational performance , HNSW seem to enjoy GPU Acceleration only with at Training time as indices are pretty compact and are VERY FAST with CPU and FAISS does not have a GPU search for this yet._**\n\nWhen choosing the strength of quantisation, there is a trade off between memory and accuracy:\n\nIndex of **1.99 million Vectors**:\n\n```\n4.63 GB (~2KB Per Vector + overhead) with a  8-Bit Quantiser while maintaining around 95-98% Accuracy^\n\n\n\n2.59 GB (~1.15KB Per Vector + overhead) with a 4-Bit Quantiser  while maintaining around 90-95% Accuracy^\n```\n\n\nAdding vectors to this kind of index is slow.\n\n_^accuracy according to official documentation and third party tests_\n", "# Metric Learning - Embedding Model\n\nAnother alternative to using vanilla flat indices with 2048 dimensional fingerprints we explore is the use of a metric learning model to create embeddings that are lower dimensions. We use these embeddings to create flat FAISS indices that are much lighter than the standard fingerprint indices (512, 256, 128, 100 dimensional embeddings vs 2048 dimensional fingerprints). We uses torch's GPU version and enjoy non-trivial speed-ups at training time, while creating embeddings and inference time (FAISS Search using a GPU index).\n\nNote: The searches are performed on a flat index, hence are exact searches, but the using of the embedding model means there is an approximation.", "We are aiming to create compound similarity search models with 4 compound libraries:\n\n- ChemDiv (100k)\n- A representative of Enamine  (~9 million)\n- DrugBank (~11k)\n- COCONUT (should be between 500k and 1 Million)\n\nWe also create a _Metric Learning Embedding Model_ out of a [reference library of 2 million compounds.](https://github.com/ersilia-os/sars-cov-2-chemspace/blob/main/data/reference_library_inchikeys.csv).\n\nFor each of the above libraries the aim is to have 3 variants of indices:\n\n- _A flat IP index with L2 Normalisation_\n    - This is going to be very large for libraries with 500k+ compounds)\n\n- _A compressed IVFPQ IP index  with L2 normalisation (FAISS compression)_\n   - This creates very light indices but as mentioned above there is a loss of search accuracy\n\n- _A flat index created with embeddings from the above mentioned model._\n   - This is lets us create indices that are lighter than vanilla flat indices and also lets us have control and confidence over the accuracy of the search (given that we are confident in the embedding model, which is arguably simpler to benchmark).\n \n", "Implemented a metric learning pipeline that creates learned embeddings from existing flat FAISS index. \n\n### Transforms 2048-dimensional fingerprints → _256/128/100-dimensional learned embeddings_ with cosine similarity\n\n### Triplet sampling: Uses existing 2M compound FAISS index for mining hard positives/negatives\n\nEvaluations: ROC-AUC, AP, distance distributions, t-SNE visualizations\n\nThe pipeline maintains L2 normalization throughout for FlatIP cosine similarity and includes model checkpointing + SMILES mapping for deployment.\n\nCreated with PyTorch + FAISS GPU.

      "repositoryName" : "ONEARMY/community-platform",
      "description" : "> Do you have attention to detail and would like to work on making the UI nicer? This issue is then for you! :))\n\n## Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.\n1. Comment section is still not matching the designs. The whitespace is lacking between the nested comments and the visually it looks tight, packed and overwhelming.\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6340e9d-7671-4308-acd0-10bf42bffd4b)\n\n2. Additionally the comment on mobile has spacing from the left, leaving the space not being utilised and making the text unnecessarily squeezed.\n<img width=\"361\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28e206b7-fbe6-471c-a2c4-8f09b1284eeb\" />\n\nEspecially with nested comments it becomes obvious:\n<img width=\"361\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86610c32-e365-414c-868e-02621ca54564\" />\n\n3. If the comment has some enters for new line and the the Show more button shows, it creates an awkward space. There is also gap applied.\n<img width=\"918\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a76486ea-e490-4860-940e-c49498ebeb1e\" />\n\n## Describe the solution you'd like\n\nGenerally I think this will need not only adjusting the numbers, but some minor restructuring of the divs. So, let me try to number the improvements:\n\n---\n\n1. Improving the spacings between the nested comments. In the designs there are also the useful buttons in each comment, that are not yet implemented. In the design however, the spacing occurs naturally because of the useful buttons, so I did not need to add a big margin-bottom. I will leave the solution here up to you, but account for the fact that one day in the future we will introduce the useful button for the comment.\n<img width=\"670\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00f1a492-0cfe-4a26-a6d4-a25e9f1e81d2\" />\n\nDon't be afraid to be generous with the spacings, in the devtools i tried 50px as in my designs\n<img width=\"978\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f23db889-05ba-4607-bedc-25d4a4abc321\" />\n\n---\n\n2. Mobile improvement. Here I upload a gif of the solution that I utilised in the Figma designs - it was to hide the left column with the avatar, allowing the text to stretch and then showing the avatar next to the username in 30x30px size.\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/329f7267-8bdb-4d18-a47c-73b7e44d5478)\n\nDon't forget to make sure that the author's badge is working \n<img width=\"502\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b3012c1-567c-4e5e-b781-5f81852bbe28\" />\n\n\n---\n\n3. Putting the Show More button directly under the comment, trimming the whitespaces. \n<img width=\"947\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c07017f7-60f7-4c1c-92f4-859c1267736f\" />\n\n\n---\n\n4. Decreasing the gap here to 5px from 10px\n<img width=\"404\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a1c56f9-11f3-4bd0-9e52-239948b15c2f\" />\n\n\n\n---\n\n5. As you can see, on mobile it gets quite tight. I would suggest removing the word Published from the \"Published x time ago\" information for the comments.\n<img width=\"322\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe06174a-b402-452b-a18b-eefd38b03192\" />\n\n\n---\n\n6. OPTIONAL - In case you would want to act on the point 5. above even more, I would suggest for mobile screens shortening the formulation even more, saying for example 1h ago, 3mo ago or 2yr ago. Reddit does it this way as well.\n\n<img width=\"182\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c194f4c-a4ee-42a1-9c59-dcd5c6b77e42\" />\n\n---\n\n7. OPTIONAL - In case you would still be up for a challenge, having these 2 aligned on the baseline would be a nice achievement, however I didn't manage to get the desired result, since as you can see below, the align-items:baseline does not align them.\n<img width=\"742\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27968c77-de84-400a-8d3f-22e88b37b627\" />\n\n\n\n##  Additional context - [FIGMA FILE HERE](https://www.figma.com/design/XYV3fr8UVOdkNyBmKHHR7f/CP---Comments-Useful---Mobile?node-id=48-79)\nYou can find the figma file above. You can see the components, the desktop and the mobile versions. These design include the correct answer feature or the useful buttons, which are not yet implemented, so feel free to ignore those.\n\n<img width=\"761\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/119c7345-44cf-4baa-9ef6-feed6a05d7ad\" />\n\nIf you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask. :))",

Cool to see that you are up for tackling these design improvements. \n\nJust yesterday we were talking with Ben, that this issue was in his opinion hard to follow and that the screenshots I included could be a bit confusing (some of them with the useful button, some without), so I thought about rewriting it. Is the issue clear to you though? If so, than let's keep it and if you find anything even slightly unclear you can tag me in the comments at any time and I'll be happy to give more clarification. :))\n\nAlso Ben mentioned that he does not have the capacity to prioritise this at the moment, so this would actually be really really helpful and valuable contribution from you. <3\n\nBen was also wrote yesterday that some of the points I mentioned were implemented already. After checking, it was only the point 5. - removing the word \"Published\" from the timestamp.\n\nI will ask the team about implementing the useful counter and let you know. :))", "@dalibormrska  - I think I understand it, but here let me try to summarize and let me know if I am understanding your requests correctly.\n\n\nRequest 1: Increase spacing between the nested comments.\nSolutions:\n- Long Term Solution: Add the Useful Counter to comments which will naturally add whitespace between the comments\n- Easier Solution: Manually add whitespace between the nested comments (which is the space the Useful Counter will take up later)\n\nRequest 2: When viewing comments (especially reply comments) in mobile, the comment text is extremely narrow.\nSolution: Remove the left side margin (make the comment text and profile image be on the same vertical line). Use the smaller version of the profile picture. Basically try to get to this design:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4045704-088e-4a7c-a7ff-bf3d1c5535b3)\n\nRequest 3: If a comment has alot of line breaks, there could be an awkward gap between the comment text and the 'Show more' button\nSolution: Remove line breaks from the end of the comment when hiding the rest of the comment behind the 'Show more' button\n\nRequest 4: Decrease Gap between profile/upload date line and comment body from 10px to 5px\nSolution: This is straight forward :), just decrease gap from 10px to 5px\n\nRequest 5: Remove the 'Published ... time ago' part of the upload date to save space\nSolution: Already Done :)\n\nRequest 6 (OPTIONAL): The upload date still takes alot of space on mobile\nSolution: Use time short hand in mobile. For example, use '5h ago' instead of '5 hours ago' or '4mo ago' instead of '4 months ago'\n\nRequest 7 (OPTIONAL): The user flag, user name, and upload date are not aligned\nSolution: Align the 3 on the baseline", "Cool, well summarised, it's pretty much spot-on. :)) \n\nThe only thing that got trickier since then is the Request 4. If you run the project locally or are a beta-tester, you will see that now the three-dots menu next to the top-comment has been implemented. The three-dots button is huge however, which makes the whole header of the top-comment taller than the replies and therefore makes it hard to achieve consistent gap.\n\nI don't know however what makes the most sense from the coding best practices - but I imagine if you tackle the Request 2. and include the avatar image in the comment header, then the whole header will get the height of the image. I would then suggest trying to make the image size and the three-dots menu size the same - let's try 35x35px and adjusting the gap accordingly.\n\n<img width=\"747\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be0d2dc1-70f8-41db-b36a-7eda73e85eb2\" />\n\nOther than that we just wait for @benfurber to assign. :))", "I'm sceptical of making the avatar too small, otherwise what's the point of showing it.\n\nIt's yours @JCSergent.\n\nOne thing to note, I'm about to implement some icon changes which includes the pointing down arrow in these screenshots." ],

Basically it seems like when the \"Servers\" column is sorted in ascending order, the column is actually sorting in a sort of reverse alphabetical order (\"US-Node-1\" comes first instead of \"Bangalore-Node 1\"). The other columns sort in the expected order based on the sort type.\n\nAs part of this we should take stock of other sortable demos/examples to ensure they're sorting correctly as expected (ignoring columns that don't utilize text, i.e. a \"favorites\" column that only has a star icon button; this will be handled by https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/issues/11006)\n\n**Is this request originating from a Red Hat product team? If so, which ones and is there any sort of deadline for this enhancement?**\n\n**Any other information?**\n",

Although you say it didn’t work, were there any techniques that says it detected? \n\nIn the meantime, I’ll try to find something that could be used as a detection in UTM-VM, but there’s no guarantees. It’s a hard process and the codebase for that project is huge.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that MacOS techniques aren’t our speciality. Although we support it, we don’t really maintain it as Linux and Windows are the most demanded platforms for this sort of project.", "@kernelwernel Thanks for the response, \n\n\nBut I think I have found the solution for that, I have added one more check for detection of Hypervisor in MAC and it helped me.\n\n`sysctl kern.hv_vmm_present` \n\nit helped me to detect UTM.", "@AdnanAhad That’s incredibly useful to know, thanks! What does that command output for UTM exactly? I’d like to know so I can add an official new technique to the library. Credit will also be given obviously :)" ],

While I don't have a fix yet, we've previously encountered a very similar issue before (https://github.com/kernelwernel/VMAware/issues/359) and all we've done to fix it was by detecting binary translation environments and blacklisting (if found) for those specific techniques, and I'm pretty sure this is the path we'll take but I need to consult with my co-dev (@NotRequiem) who manages these techniques. I assume he's sleeping at the moment, but I'll let him know about the issue.\n\n> You can see in that all hypervisor registers are all zeroes.\n\nThat technique isn't really relevant in this scenario, it's relatively common to have that output.\n\n> I know that a normal hypervisor will return a bendstring when calling CPUID EAX=0x40000000. However, it is a bit strange to see that it is detected as a VM even though it is all 0.\n\nI assume you meant \"brand string\" instead of bendstring, but this is also not surprising since it's a binary translator. I *assume* you have Microsoft PRISM doing the x86 to ARM translation, which isn't really accurate to call it an emulator in itself but that's besides the point.\n\nA lot of funky stuff happens when the binary is being translated to a different ISA, but we still do our best to keep it as compatible as possible with the same core mechanisms we've done for real x86 hardware.

A simple x seconds delay configurable from the yaml file would allow users to slow down crawls.\r\n\r\nThis is similar to https://github.com/elastic/crawler/issues/46 (abiding by `Crawl-delay` in robots.txt). However, a general delay would be useful for users who can't or don't want to change the robots.txt.\r\n\r\nWhen both are implemented, the highest value of the two should be used for the crawl delay.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Solution\r\n\r\nAdd a configurable crawl delay in yaml file.\r\n\r\n### Additional Context\r\n\r\nLink to discuss forum: https://discuss.elastic.co/t/apply-delay-between-requests-in-elastic-crawler/361375/4\r\n",

I propose we switch to following the [XDG Base Directory Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html) because:\n* Standardization: XDG paths are the standard across Linux and many Unix-like environments, improving consistency.\n* Flexibility: Allows users to customize locations via environment variables (XDG_CONFIG_HOME, XDG_DATA_HOME), avoiding clutter in the home directory.\n* Compatibility: Better aligns with modern best practices and other open-source tools.\n* Cross-platform: Provides a clearer way to handle config/data locations on different OSes.\n\n### \uD83D\uDCA1 Why is this needed? What if we don't build it?\n\nConsistency!\n\n### Other thoughts\n\n_No response_",

      "description" : "## Guideline\n1. Carefully read the issue description before applying to ensure you have all the necessary information to start working on it.\n2. Write a brief description of how you will approach the task (without using ChatGPT).\n3. Add your Telegram handler in your application (e.g., in OnlyDust or similar)\n4. Write ETA in your application\n\n\n\n## What should I do if I have a problem\n1. Try to google it before asking. Googling is taking major part of dev work \n2. If you couldn't find answer your question with Google, text your question to [dev](https://t.me/spotnet_dev/4) group with your question.\n3. Do not send DM to maintainer, it would be better and faster to ask other contributors in chat \n\n\n## How to prepare PR\n1. Check if your code [smell](https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/smells) good\n2.  Add `close #<issue number>` to link your issue with your PR\n3.  Do not commit changes which is not related to your task \n4. Check after you created PR, if you committed everything.\n\n## Task description  \n1. Create a `POST /signup` endpoint that accepts only the user's email in the request body:\n```json\n{\n  \"email\": \"user@example.com\"\n}\n```\n\n2.

I do not know about how to do diff, but surely there has to be a way via nsys cli.\n\nNo sure yet how it is gonna behave with Phoenix, but integrating this into self-hosted `test.yml` is the way.\nAlso, never tested it, but I guess it is possible to profile a run locally using the workflow file with github cli `gh act -P ubuntu-latest=-self-hosted -W .github/workflows/profiling.yml` or by simply installing Nsights then `nsys profile -o report ./mfc.sh test -a --gpu`", "@Malmahrouqi3 thanks, yes you can add it that way, it's a good POC. you actually just pass different commands to the nsys command, `nsys --help` or whatever, and it will give you the information on the command line and you would just dump that into the output of the CI. I'm not sure if a diff is the best way to go or not (presumably that would go into benchmarking since it would have to be PR vs. Master). \n\nThe easiest way to get a merge in, that could possibly be migrated to benchmarking later, would be to just run the nsys command with appropriate flags, and it will tell you what the most expensive subroutines are. We have some documentation on nsight profiling in the MFC docs `./mfc.sh run <...> --profile` should work I think. But I think that will just create a report file you look at in the GUI.

      "description" : "## Guideline\n1. Carefully read the issue description before applying to ensure you have all the necessary information to start working on it.\n2. Write a brief description of how you will approach the task (without using ChatGPT).\n3. Add your Telegram handler in your application (e.g., in OnlyDust or similar)\n4. Write ETA in your application\n\n\n\n## What should I do if I have a problem\n1. Try to google it before asking. Googling is taking major part of dev work \n2. If you couldn't find answer your question with Google, text your question to [dev](https://t.me/spotnet_dev/4) group with your question.\n3. Do not send DM to maintainer, it would be better and faster to ask other contributors in chat \n\n\n## How to prepare PR\n1. Check if your code [smell](https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/smells) good\n2. Add `close #<issue number>` to link your issue with your PR\n3. Do not commit changes that are unrelated to your task\n4. Check after you created PR, if you committed everything\n\n\n## Task Description\n1. In the [handlers folder](./blob/main/margin/margin_app/app/telegram/handlers), create a new file named `admin.py`. Inside, add a handler called `/assets`. Use the [`Admin Filter` from this issue](https://github.com/djeck1432/spotnet/issues/915) to verify the user is an admin. Then, call the [`Assets statistic` method from this issue](https://github.com/djeck1432/spotnet/issues/906) to retrieve the data. Format the response using Telegram Markdown so it displays neatly.\n2. Provide a screenshot demonstrating that the handler works as expected.\n",

It makes sense for DagRun with multiple versions, but I don't think we should be able to explore DagVersions that are not part of the selected dagrun at all. \n\nIt makes it hard to follow when we start playing with the `version selector` when a DagRun is selected. (Is the DagVersion that I have selected part of the DagRun.dag_versions, or am I watching a completely unrelated structure)\n\n\nFor instance in the following image I have the `v2` structure displayed for a DagRun that actually only has `v4` part of his versions. The output graph doesn't make much sense.\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb45d6a5-514f-464e-b756-39c8b0a70c39)\n\n\nI do not know yet what is the best way to address this, any idea is welcome.\n### Committer\n\n- [x] I acknowledge that I am a maintainer/committer of the Apache Airflow project.",

The directory includes artifacts that meet the CR requirements, along with PGP signatures for every file. I'm fairly sure, given the actual error below, that the artifacts themselves don't matter.\n\nI have the following `jreleaser.toml`:\n\n```\n[deploy.maven.mavenCentral.sonatype]\nactive = \"ALWAYS\"\nsign = false\nurl = \"https://central.sonatype.com/api/v1/publisher\"\nstagingRepositories = [\"build/maven\"]\n```\n\nI run jreleaser:\n\n```\n$ env \\\nJRELEASER_MAVENCENTRAL_USERNAME=\"${MAVEN_CENTRAL_USERNAME}\" \\\nJRELEASER_MAVENCENTRAL_PASSWORD=\"${MAVEN_CENTRAL_PASSWORD}\" \\\nJRELEASER_PROJECT_JAVA_GROUP_ID=\"${JRELEASER_PROJECT_JAVA_GROUP_ID}\" \\\nJRELEASER_PROJECT_VERSION=\"${JRELEASER_PROJECT_VERSION}\" \\\n./jreleaser deploy --config-file=jreleaser.toml\n```\n\n### Expected Behaviour\n\nI'd expect to see `jreleaser` create a bundle and deploy it to Maven Central.\n\n### Actual Behaviour\n\n```\n[INFO]  JReleaser

      "description" : "# Fork, Commit, Merge - Medium Issue 2 (React.js)\r\n\r\n## Create a Traffic Light Component\r\n*Note: You don't have ask permission to start solving the issue or get assigned, since these issues are supposed to be always open for new contributors. The actions-user bot will reset the file back to previous state for the next contributor after your commit is merged. So you can just simply start working with the issue right away!*\r\n\r\n### How to get started:\r\n\r\nStart by navigating inside of the directory used in this project with the command:\r\n```bash\r\ncd tasks/react/medium/traffic-light\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen run `npm i` to install Vite, React and all the necessary dependencies for the project.\r\n\r\nAfter installing the dependencies you can open the `src` directory and the `TrafficLight.tsx` file, and start implementing your solution!\r\n\r\n![react-medium](https://github.com/fork-commit-merge/fork-commit-merge/assets/82566656/e154750d-41fd-4db4-bcc6-9dd52c7e55d6)\r\n\r\n### Description:\r\n\r\nCreate a React component using TypeScript that simulates a traffic light. The component should display three lights (red, yellow, and green) and switch between them automatically in the order of a typical traffic light sequence.\r\n\r\n### Requirements:\r\n\r\n-   Implement a `TrafficLight` component in `src/TrafficLight.tsx`.\r\n-   Use TypeScript for type safety.\r\n-   The component should render three circles, colored red, yellow, and green.\r\n-   The traffic light should start with the red light.\r\n-   After a few seconds, it should change to green, then yellow, and then back to red in a continuous loop.\r\n-   Only one light should be \"active\" (brighter) at a time.\r\n\r\nThere are some CSS classes already added for you in the `src/App.css` file, which you can use if you like, or write your own custom CSS.\r\nThere is for example a helper pseudo-class selector for every light that is not active, which will set the light color to gray if the light does not have the `active` class:\r\n\r\n![react-medium-css](https://github.com/fork-commit-merge/fork-commit-merge/assets/82566656/052aaf61-e4d9-40b9-8876-bf96aa2ada9c)\r\n\r\n### Example:\r\n\r\nThe traffic light should cycle as follows:\r\n\r\n-   Red (active) for 4 seconds.\r\n-   Green (active) for 3 seconds.\r\n-   Yellow (active) for 1 second.\r\n-   Repeat the cycle.\r\n\r\n## How to run:\r\nAfter you are done with the card, make sure you are in the `tasks/react/medium/traffic-light` in your terminal and run `npm run dev` to start the Vite server. Then, open \"http://localhost:5173/\" in your browser to check how the app looks.\r\n\r\nIf it looks to be working fine, you are ready to make a pull request!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo work with this issue, you need to have npm and NodeJS installed to your local machine.\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions of installing npm and NodeJS as well as how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Why use Vite?\r\n\r\nThis React project uses Vite for near-instant server start-ups and incredibly fast hot module replacements, providing a smooth and efficient development experience.\r\nAlso Vite requires minimal setup, allowing us to focus on writing React code without getting bogged down in complex configurations.\r\nIf you want to learn more about Vite, check out the documentation:\r\n[Vite Official Documentation](https://vitejs.dev/)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

      "url" : "https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/61826",
      "repositoryName" : "dotnet/aspnetcore",
      "description" : "## Summary\n\nAdd a ```blob([mimeType: string])``` method to ```DotNetStreamReference``` in Blazor, allowing developers to obtain a Blob from a .NET stream in JavaScript, without fully loading the stream into memory. We chose this specific issue, because it is a \"good-first-issue\" and we are participating in a germany wide competition, where the subject is to work on issues in open source projects. \nLink to issue: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/47685\n\n## Motivation and goals\n\nBlazor developers can currently pass .NET streams to JavaScript using ```DotNetStreamReference```, which exposes two main methods:\n- ```stream()``` (returns a ReadableStream)\n- ```arrayBuffer()``` (loads the full stream into memory)\n\nThe problem:\n- There is no direct way to obtain a Blob, which is required for many web APIs (like ```<video>``` elements, file downloads or drag-and-drop functionality).\n- ```arrayBuffer()``` is not suitable for large files (like videos) because it fully buffers the stream in memory before use.\n- Using ```stream()``` gives a ReadableStream, but many APIs (like ```<video src=...>```, ```URL.createObjectURL()```) require a Blob, not a stream, and converting a ReadableStream into a Blob in JS is non-trivial and inefficient.\n\nAdding a ```blob()``` method would:\n- Allow efficient handling of large files (like video or audio) without consuming excessive memory.\n- Simplify developer workflows by aligning with common web APIs that expect a Blob.\n- Close a usability gap in the current Blazor-JS interop system.\n\n## In scope\n\n- A new method ```blob([mimeType: string])``` on ```DotNetStreamReference``` that returns a Blob representing the .NET stream.\n- Ensuring the Blob can be used with standard web APIs (e.g., ```<video>```, ```<audio>```, ```URL.createObjectURL()```).\n- Keeping performance and memory usage efficient for large streams.\n\n## Out of scope\n\n- Changes to the existing stream() or arrayBuffer() methods.\n- Polyfills for browsers that lack Blob support (modern browsers are assumed).\n- Enhancements to streaming APIs beyond providing the Blob.\n\n## Risks / unknowns\n- **Browser behavior**: While Blobs are widely supported, the implementation detail of\nstreaming data into a Blob without full buffering might depend on browser internals.\nSome browsers may still buffer the entire Blob in memory before making it available.\n\n- **Memory use**: Even if we avoid buffering in .NET or JS, the underlying browser may still\nend up consuming memory when the Blob is accessed, especially for very large files.\n\n- **Implementation complexity**: Creating a Blob from a .NET stream across JS interop\nmight require platform-level work to ensure true streaming behavior rather than just\nbuffering and converting.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Blazor usage example\n```blazor\n<video @ref=\"videoPlayer\" controls autoplay></video>\n\n<button @onclick=\"PlayVideo\">Play Streamed Video</button>\n\n@code {\n    private ElementReference videoPlayer;\n\n    private async Task PlayVideo()\n    {\n        using var fileStream = File.OpenRead(\"bigvideo.mp4\");\n        var streamRef = new DotNetStreamReference(fileStream);\n\n        // JS call to create a blob URL from the .NET stream\n        var videoUrl = await JS.InvokeAsync<string>(\"createVideoBlobUrl\", streamRef);\n\n        // Set the video source\n        await JS.InvokeVoidAsync(\"setVideoSrc\", videoPlayer, videoUrl);\n    }\n}\n```\n### JavaScript interop\n```JavaScript\nwindow.createVideoBlobUrl = async function (streamRef) {\n    const blob = await streamRef.blob(\"video/mp4\");\n    return URL.createObjectURL(blob);\n};\n\nwindow.setVideoSrc = function (videoElement, src) {\n    videoElement.src = src;\n};\n```\n",

      "description" : "# Background\nHi community,\n\nShardingSphere's parser engine enables users to parse SQL into AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) and convert it into SQLStatement objects. \nThis issue focuses on enhancing MySQL stored procedure parsing capabilities to support complex database programming logic.\n\nMore details:\nhttps://shardingsphere.apache.org/document/current/en/reference/sharding/parse/\n\n# Issue Background Explanation\n\nThese SQL statements are from the official MySQL test set. \nYou can find the corresponding stored procedure SQL statements in the following website: https://github.com/mysql/mysql-server/tree/8.0/mysql-test/t \nThese SQL cases are then passed to ShardingSphere's parsing engine for analysis. \nFor SQL cases that fail to be parsed successfully, every 3 to 5 SQL cases are grouped together as an issue.\n1. It cannot be guaranteed that all SQL cases are correct. Please follow the following process to handle this pull request (PR).\n2. Some SQL cases may have already been fixed in other PRs. For cases that can already be executed successfully, simply leave a comment to ignore them.\n3. If a SQL case can be executed successfully without any code changes, there is no need to add a corresponding test assert file.\n\n# Task\nThis issue requires adding support for the following MySQL stored procedure syntax:\n```sql\n-- The original file and line number of the sql: analyze:85 \nCREATE PROCEDURE p() ANALYZE TABLE v UPDATE HISTOGRAM ON w\n```\n\n```sql\n-- The original file and line number of the sql: change_user_deadlock:35 \nEND |\nCREATE PROCEDURE p_processlist()\nBEGIN\nDECLARE x INT DEFAULT 3000\n```\n\n```sql\n-- The original file and line number of the sql: change_user_deadlock:26 \nCREATE PROCEDURE p_flush_status()\nBEGIN\nDECLARE x INT DEFAULT 3000\n```\n\n```sql\n-- The original file and line number of the sql: clear_diag_area:254 \nCREATE PROCEDURE p7_show_warnings ()\nBEGIN\nSHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'foo';\nSHOW WARNINGS;\nSELECT \"(SHOW WARNINGS does not have to come last)\";\nEND\n```\n\n```sql\n-- The original file and line number of the sql: clear_diag_area:263 \nCREATE PROCEDURE p8b_show_warnings ()\nBEGIN\nSHOW WARNINGS;\nEND\n```\n\n\n# Overall Procedure\nIf you intend to participate in fixing this issue, please feel free to leave a comment below the issue. Community members will assign the issue accordingly.\nFor example, you can leave a comment like this: \"Hi, please assign this issue to me. Thank you!\"\n\nOnce you have claimed the issue, please review the syntax of the SQL on the official website of the corresponding database. \nExecute the SQL on the respective database to ensure the correctness of the SQL syntax.\n\nYou can check the corresponding source of each SQL case on the official database website.\nNext, execute the problematic SQL cases mentioned above in the database (you can quickly start the corresponding database using the Docker image for that database, and then connect to it using a client you are  familiar with), to ensure that the SQL syntax itself is correct.\n\n\nOnce you have confirmed the correctness of the SQL syntax, you can validate and fix the grammar parsing issue in ShardingSphere.\n>If you are using IntelliJ IDEA, you will need to install the ANTLR plugin before proceeding.\nIf it is an ANTLR parsing error message, try to repair the `.g4` file by comparing it with the official database syntax until the SQL can be correctly parsed by ANTLR.\nWhen there is no error message in the ANTLR Preview window, it means that ANTLR can correctly parse the SQL.\n\n\nAfter ANTLR parses SQL into an abstract syntax tree, ShardingSphere will access the abstract syntax tree through Visitor and extract the required information.\nIf you need to extract Segments, you need to first execute:\n```shell\nmvn -T 2C clean install -DskipTests\n```\nUnder the shardingsphere-parser module to compile the entire parser module.\nThen rewrite the corresponding visit method in SQLStatementVisitorr as needed to extract the corresponding Segment.\n\n\nAfter the above SQL parsing problem is repaired, the corresponding Test needs to be added.\nThe steps are as follows:\n1. Add the corresponding `sql-case` in the `sql/supported` directory.\n2. Add case assertions in the case directory of the `shardingsphere-test-it-parser` module.\n3. Run `org.apache.shardingsphere.test.it.sql.parser.internal.InternalSQLParserIT`\nAfter SQL Parser IT runs successfully, you can submit a PR.\n\n\n1. Master JAVA language\n2. Have a basic understanding of Antlr g4 file\n3. Be familiar with MySQL SQLs",

This will help you learn the basics of reading and updating signals in Solid.js.\n\n---\n***Note: You don't have ask permission to start solving the issue or get assigned, since these issues are supposed to be always open for new contributors. The actions-user bot will reset the file back to previous state for the next contributor after your commit is merged. So you can just simply start working with the issue right away!***\n\nIssue created by ***![zshaian](https://github.com/zshaian)***.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nYou can start by navigating to the folder `./task/solid/easy`\n\nOnce you are on that folder you can then install the packages that you are going to need to run Solid.js framework, you can do so by running `npm i`\n\nAfter installing the dependencies you can open the src directory and App.jsx file, and start implementing your solution!\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/682663cd-4af6-4c69-b3f7-4e8e41bfb798)\n\n**All the CSS classes needed in this project has already been done for you in index.css and app.module.css.**\n\n## Requiremets:\n\n- Implement the counter state with the name of \"count\" and a setter named \"setCount\"\n- Display the current count\n- Increment or Decrement the count state using the \"setCount\"\n\nIf you can display the current count and increment or decrement it based on the buttons, you are ready to make a pull request.\n\n---\nTo work with this issue, you need to have npm and NodeJS installed to your local machine.\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/fork-commit-merge/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions of installing npm and NodeJS as well as how to make a pull request.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\n\n**Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!**",
