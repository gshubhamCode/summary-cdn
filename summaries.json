I don't have a \"plan\" in the standard sense. I am working on software that provides a GUI for \"plan builder\" for running my experiment. \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/498da074-9fd5-45e4-90ca-0caf5061c4b0)\n\nIn general, it can be summarized to the plan like this:\n\n```\ndevices = [motor0, motor1, motor2, detector0,....]\nmonitor = [motor0, motor1, motor2,...]\nunmonitor_before_read = [motor2,motor1]\ndef plan():\n    yield from bps.open_run()\n    yield from bps.trigger_and_read(devices)\n    for motor in monitor:\n        yield from bps.monitor(motor, name=motor.name+\"_monitor\")\n\n    # >>> generated by \"plan builder\"\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            for m in unmonitor_before_read:\n                yield from bps.unmonitor(m)\n            yield from bps.trigger_and_read(devices)\n            for m in unmonitor_before_read:\n                yield from bps.monitor(m,name=m.name+\"_monitor\")\n    # << generated by \"plan builder\"\n    \n    yield from bps.close_run()\n```\nSo I start and interrupt the monitors depending on the inner plans. As I said before, the error appears randomly, so I can't reproduce it in the simplified plan. I do not exclude that \"plan builder\" generates code with errors, as this project is in its early stage.\nA simple copy of the `_listeners` dict solves the problem, so I decided to share it with the community...\n" ],

      "description" : "### Describe the bug\n\nWhen resizing the window in the 'Revision' tab of a topic page, the layout of the mat-card in the body is incorrectly formatted. This issue occurs after enabling the practice tab and can be consistently reproduced.\n\n\n### URL of the page where the issue is observed.\n\nN/A\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Assign yourself the Curriculum Admin role.\n\n2. Generate:\n\n    - A dummy math classroom\n\n    - A dummy topic\n\n    - A dummy skill\n\n3. Add the dummy topic to the math classroom via http://localhost:8181/classroom-admin.\n\n4. In the Topic Editor, add the dummy skill to a subtopic.\n\n5. Check the \"Show practice tab to learners\" option.\n\n6. Go to the topic's page and open the Revision tab.\n\n7. Resize the browser window while on the Revision tab.\n\n8. Observe the formatting of the mat-card in the body.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe layout of the mat-card should adapt responsively and remain well-formatted, similar to how it behaves in the Learn page(http://localhost:8181/learn/math/dummy-topic-one/practice).\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/460c1fa2-e90d-4ab6-be00-4a2093723b55)\n\n### Screenshots/Videos\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d8ceab3-a026-41dc-b9f1-62023627e999)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f8229d5-d387-470c-812e-623ddba5a355)\n\n### What device are you using?\n\nDesktop, Mobile\n\n### Operating System\n\nMacOS\n\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Browser version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Tips for developers\n\nBefore addressing the bug, please identify which PR caused the issue (you can follow the steps [here](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/How-to-find-the-commit-which-introduced-a-bug)). If you identify the PR, comment on the issue with a link to it. If not, mention the commit hash of the oldest commit you saw the bug on (and the month and year it was made in).\n\nThen, please leave a comment with details of the approach that you plan to take to fix the issue (see [example](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/issues/19157#issuecomment-1858788463)).\n\n**Note:** If this is your first Oppia issue, please make sure to follow our guidelines for [choosing an issue](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Contributing-code-to-Oppia#choosing-a-good-first-issue) and [setting things up](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Contributing-code-to-Oppia#setting-things-up). You will also need to show a demo of the fix working correctly on your local machine. Thanks!\n",

      "description" : "### Bug description\n\nWhen configuring dashboard filters with the \"Values are dependent on other filters\" option, the system prevents creating bi-directional dependencies upfront by showing a \"Cyclic dependency detected\" message. However, it allows creating the same dependency indirectly after saving the initial filter configuration.\n\n1. If Filter A is set to depend on Filter B, the system blocks setting Filter B to depend on Filter A immediately, showing a \"Cyclic dependency detected\" message.\n2. However, if Filter A is saved with the dependency on Filter B, the system later allows editing Filter B to create the reverse dependency, effectively forming a bi-directional (cyclic) dependency.\n\nThis behavior is inconsistent and might lead to unexpected filter behavior. It appears to contradict the intended prevention of cyclic dependencies.\nHow to reproduce the bug\n\n1. Create a dashboard filter (e.g., Filter A) with a dependency on another filter (e.g., Filter B) by enabling the Values are dependent on other filters option.\n2. Save the filter configuration.\n3. Open the dashboard filter configuration again, select Filter B, and set it to depend on Filter A.\n4. Save the changes.\n\n## Expected results\n\nThe system should prevent bi-directional (cyclic) dependencies for all filter types, not just date filters. Users should not be able to create a cyclic dependency by editing the filters after saving the initial configuration.\n\n## Actual results\n\nThe platform allows creating cyclic dependencies indirectly after the initial configuration, even though it prevents it upfront. This behavior is inconsistent and may lead to unexpected filter behavior.\n\n### Screenshots/recordings\n\n_No response_\n\n### Superset version\n\nmaster / latest-dev\n\n### Python version\n\n3.11\n\n### Node version\n\n18 or greater\n\n### Browser\n\nChrome\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Checklist\n\n- [x] I have searched Superset docs and Slack and didn't find a solution to my problem.\n- [x] I have searched the GitHub issue tracker and didn't find a similar bug report.\n- [x] I have checked Superset's logs for errors and if I found a relevant Python stacktrace, I included it here as text in the \"additional context\" section.",

      "description" : "Currently when a user presses enter, the profile page at the top of the results list is what loads. However, consider how Google treats this (screenshot below).\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17221652/118880440-dc58bf00-b8bf-11eb-8d7f-20e752a01733.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17221652/118880777-41141980-b8c0-11eb-8b0c-4b5eca9ee53a.png)\r\n\r\nI am not suggesting that we use auto-complete (though that is certainly an interesting idea) but notice that in this instance if one was to press \"enter\" Google would not bring you to search results for \"gordon college bennett center\" but rather what I typed - \"gordon college.\" This contrasts to our quick Header People Search, which just assumes you meant the top result if you press enter (which is more like the first screenshot).\r\n\r\nWhat if instead, pressing enter takes you to People Search with pre-filled in entries _based on_ the top result. For example, entering \"Cam\" into the Header People Search like this first image would lead to the page in the second image because the top result matched using first name.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17221652/118881598-46be2f00-b8c1-11eb-9822-a53ce80209e6.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17221652/118881657-50e02d80-b8c1-11eb-8db3-8d3efa947181.png)\r\n\r\nHowever, if \"Campo\" is typed, the top result is based on the last name \"Campoli\" so it should lead to the appropriate page.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17221652/118882034-b6341e80-b8c1-11eb-80d4-a861c3e2549c.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17221652/118882191-e8de1700-b8c1-11eb-97a9-c9fafe73e9ae.png)\r\n\r\nFor the use case that a first _and_ last name is entered in some fashion, intuitively both these sections would be filled. So if one enters \"Cam A\" the People Search results for first name \"Cam\" and last name \"A\" should appear.\r\n\r\nAs another use case, perhaps if there is only one result for a given search criterium, we can go straight to that particular profile like we are currently with all search results. That may be debatably less consistent, but a good practical idea to consider.\r\n",

      "comments" : [ "I wonder if it would be beneficial to modify the people search page to have a generic search bar that runs off of similar functionality to the quick people search bar. Then, you could have an \"advanced search\" button that would switch the view to our existing people search page (with all of the more specific fields & filters). This would be more like traditional search pages as it still allows for the basic search with a results page.\r\n\r\nOnce we did that, we would be able to pass a generic query parameter (like \"Cam\" in this case) and it would bring up all of the results that you would have seen in the quick search bar previously. I think that makes the most UX sense, but I welcome input from @EjPlatzer @ChrisImagineer .", "I'm not sure I see the use case for having the People Search page duplicate the functionality of the quick search bar. Given that the quick search bar is visible from every page (as long as you're authenticated), no one would ever need to use the People Search page for the \"non-advanced\" search features - they can simply use the search bar.\r\n\r\nGiven that, it seems like the only reason to have the simple search is to make it easier for us as developers to pass search values from the search bar to the people search page. Assuming that's something we want to do (which I'm not convinced it is), we shouldn't default to this implementation just because it's the easiest.\r\n\r\nConsider, for example, why someone would want to go from the search bar to the People Search page: they weren't able to find what they were looking for from the search bar. If I couldn't find what I wanted to in the search bar, and then was re-directed to a page that displayed the exact same search bar with the exact same results, I would be a mixture of frustrated and disappointed.\r\n\r\nI think instead, if we did want to redirect to the People Search page automatically, we should show the current search page and populate the fields with the person's search bar query. That would mean naively putting their search into the first name field if they only put one word in, but that's still better than showing them a bigger version of the same thing they were just looking at.\r\n\r\nFor the record, I don't think hitting enter in the search bar should redirect someone to the People Search page. Instead, we should adjust the highlighting so that the first element in the results is highlighted by default:\r\n<img width=\"288\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35319956/166314896-2df85ce4-df1e-44d2-89b4-e2bb642c31a0.png\">\r\nThis way it's more clear to the user what will happen if they hit enter.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we could include a \"advanced search\" link at the bottom of the search bar results list that redirects to the People Search page (possibly pre-filled with their search bar query). So when someone scrolls through all the search bar results without finding what they were looking for they can go straight to advanced search. That seems like a more natural and fluid set of use cases in my opinion.", "I agree with Evan.  We should highlight the top entry by default to make the current behavior clearer.  Already, using up/down arrows highlights the other entries, and \"enter\" goes to the page for the selected user.  So the only flaw is not starting with the top item highlighted. " ],

To me, that's intentional, because if one makes a lot of manual edits to the grid it might be a bit wasteful to refresh the schema preview every time (that can take quite some time).\r\n\r\nBut it begs the question: why not provide a manual way to refresh the schema issues and preview? That would at least be useful after such manual edits, and would also provide a workaround in cases where the schema should have been refreshed but was not.\r\n\r\nWe already have such a button in the facets panel, which serves the same purpose: normally, they get refreshed automatically, but not after manual edits, so in rare cases it is useful to have it.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think @cooperzoe?", "I like the idea of having a manual refresh right in the schema issues & preview tabs. \r\n\r\nI don't think it should be a button, I think a small refresh icon in the tabs would be the most intuitive.\r\n\r\nHere's a sketch of what it would look like (in the preview tab):\r\n![Screenshot 2024-02-05 at 10 52 29 AM](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/assets/52141007/851382b3-bce5-4aad-b440-18f0921aa463)\r\n", "I want to do this issue.

Schema Refactor (Supabase)\n- Identify all instances of `owner_id` across the Supabase schema (tables, relationships, foreign keys).\n- Rename the columns to `kinder_id`, preserving existing constraints.\n- Create a properly versioned SQL migration file using Supabase CLI and place it under `services/supabase/migrations/`.\n- Validate database consistency after the rename through Supabase CLI and dashboard tools.\n\n### 2. Backend Adjustments (`services/supabase`)\n- Refactor all code references to `owner_id` across query logic, types, and service utilities.\n- Ensure all affected endpoints and mutations behave as expected with the updated schema.\n\n### 3. Frontend Integration (`apps/web`)\n- Update Supabase queries, types, and hooks that reference `owner_id`.\n- Refactor relevant components or forms handling project ownership or user metadata.\n- Run and update any impacted unit tests or mocks accordingly.\n\n### 4. Documentation\n- Update schema diagrams, ERD references, and technical documentation under `docs/` to reflect the updated field naming and align with project terminology.\n\n###  Deliverables\n- Fully working PR with schema + code changes.\n- A Supabase CLI-compatible SQL migration script.\n- Clear changelog and commit breakdown.\n- Optional: Schema diff or notes for internal dev reference.\n\n**ETA:** I estimate 36–48 hours for full implementation, testing, and documentation updates.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to take it! \nHappy to help standardize and improve the DB structure.\n", "# Hi there, @4c1d-V \uD83D\uDC4B You've been assigned this issue.\n\nOne invite is waiting for you in your email.

Add a derive macro that would create generic `AsFormField` `impl`s for the enum as well as `Vec<T>`, `HashSet<T>`, etc., similarly to the ones for `Weekday`.\n2. Add wrapper structs (e.g. `Choice` and `ChoiceMultiple`) that would contain the enum implementing SelectChoice, and a `Vec` of these, respectively.\n\nWhich of these would be more appropriate is subject to discussion.

I'm interested in helping out, but I couldn't find any `beman/ranges_and_views` repo in the Beman Organization.\n\nIt's inactive, so it needs help.  Right now we have any_view and utf_view which are c++29 things --  and they're taking the approach of a single repo per range/view.  So I think that's likely what we should do until we have a big enough collection of range things to put them together -- which sounds like a packaging thing.  So repo named something like `concat_view`.  \n\nSo basically you'd need to clone examplar and do the chore of replacing things.

I'll take a look at that PR; it looks interesting.\n\nNow coming to the actual implementation stuff:\nI think I'd like to start with one of the simpler papers (in the first comment in this issue) and not directly get started with `concat`, which was noted to be quite difficult. This will help me get used to the workflow as well as the implementation side of things, which I personally don't have too much experience with yet.\n\nIn particular, `std::views::indices` looks to me like the perfect trial grounds for that.\n\nSo, to that end, if I understood the instructions correctly, I should make a repo called `view_indices`? (I'm not exactly sure what the name should be for this one to allow for maximum clarity.)", "I looked through the `std::views::indices` paper, and to me, it looks too small to me to warrant a repo of its own.", "I did a little research and found that `.` is a valid character in repo names so we should have no issues with making repos like\n- `ranges_and_views.indices`\n- `ranges_and_views.to_input`\n- `ranges_and_views.cache_last`\n- `ranges_and_views.concat`\n\nEven though packaging is further into the future (as in, we can't think about packaging if there's nothing _to_ package \uD83D\uDE04), this _should_ make it easier for a bot or whatever to find and pick up these repos and put them together.", "So this is a bit of a naming bikeshed that we shouldn't get too concerned with because repo names can also be changed later. We have 2 view types and so far they follow the naming pattern of `type_view` -- so `utf_view` and `any_view`.  These names are succint and simple. So for the above I'd suggest `indicies_view`, `to_input_view`, etc. \n\nw.r.t. sufficient size to warrent a repo, I'm certainly sympathetic to that thought -- it feels really heavy for a < 100 sloc project.  But the issue I see, is one might start to wonder why `utf_view` and `any_view` live elsewhere and aren't part of `ranges_and_views`. After all, they are....\n\n> we can't think about packaging if there's nothing to package\n\nreally, that's the key point :) We need an implementation on the ground before anything else really matters.  Everything we're discussing here is changable later...", "> So for the above I'd suggest `indicies_view`, `to_input_view`, etc.\n\nGot it \uD83D\uDC4D.

However, Apple uses an older version of Clang (v17) in its XCode SDK, so the bug is still showing up. But the bug is fixed upstream (in LLVM). We simply need to wait for XCode to release a version with a recent-enough version of Clang, to remove the workaround I have in place.\n\nI also linked to a [Godbolt example](https://godbolt.org/z/fjbo87MbK) demonstrating the issue in the comments.\n\n> So for changes in the future I suggest making an issue -- making a branch associated with that issue -- and then a request to merge to main.\n\nUnderstood. sorry about that \uD83D\uDE05\n\n> Lol I suppose we haven't written this down!\n\nI think you're right.

Ideally we want the default value to be rendered in the props table, rather than rendering as though there isn't any default value currently.\n\n\nOriginal comment:\n\nThe `Spinner` component hardcodes `aria-label` attribute when neither `aria-label` nor `aria-labelledby` is provided.\n\nhttps://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/blob/3ba79b0c6c6e750996f6134251dc6c6bd5eeb28a/packages/react-core/src/components/Spinner/Spinner.tsx#L47\n\n**How do you reproduce the problem?**\n\nMount a `Spinner` without providing an `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`.\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nA spinner without a hardcoded English value. The component should allow consumers to use it without `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`. It might be just a complementary visual hint hidden from the a11y tree using `aria-hidden` when rendered alongside relevant text.\n\n**Is this issue blocking you?**\n\nSomehow.

My fault! I completely overlooked the `progressbar` role that the Spinner SVG is using! That’s why I wasn’t fully understanding the decision of going for these default values.\n\nRegarding having both the `aria-label` and the static text, I thought it might be redundant and possibly annoying for screen reader users, especially if both contain the same message. In any case, now that I have a better understanding, I’ll rework my use of the Spinner to include only one descriptive text. Either by using `aria-labelledby` or by adding `aria-hidden` to the static text if it doesn’t provide any additional value.\n\n> That I think makes sense since just the aria-valuenow content (be it \"Loading\" or something similar) doesn't provide great context (what exactly is loading?).\n\nFully agree. \"Loading\" alone lacks the necessary context.\n\n> \n> Though I might strongly recommend against it, if `aria-hidden` is being passed to a Spinner, that should somewhat resolve the issue of having a default aria-label applied. While the aria-label will still be there, the Spinner won't be in the a11y tree.\n> \n\nNo doubts, I’ve got a long road ahead on my accessibility learning journey, as this issue has proven. That said, in my tests, when `aria-hidden` is applied, the entire Spinner is removed from the accessibility tree, including its `aria-label` (checked with Chrome and Firefox developer tools) .\n\n> I do think we can tweak the Spinner code so that the default value of aria-label is rendered in the props table, though.\n\nAgain, thank you for your enlightening explanation and please excuse me for reporting this as an issue when it clearly wasn’t one \uD83D\uDE4F ", "It's better to raise an issue that may turn out to be intended behavior than have something sneak by us, so absolutely no worries opening this!

So, I'd label it as good first issue and give others a chance to work on it.\n\nThat said, just in case could be useful for others, as far as I could check, https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-org is relying on https://github.com/reactjs/react-docgen for generating the [PropsTable](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-org/blob/main/packages/documentation-framework/components/propsTable/propsTable.js#L18).

I'll open an issue in org for this.\n\n\n**Is this request originating from a Red Hat product team? If so, which ones and is there any sort of deadline for this enhancement?**\n\n**Any other information?**\n",

Please describe.\n\nWe want to separate data storage at the bucket level in S3, based on resource attributes. Currently, this requires us to configure a new exporter each time a new bucket is introduced, which becomes difficult to manage at scale.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nSince dynamic \"s3_prefix\" support already exists, it would be great to extend this functionality to also support \"s3_bucket\", allowing the bucket name to be derived from resource attributes dynamically.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\nI'm not very familiar with Go, so I'm hoping the owners can take this on. I assume this feature would be relatively straightforward to implement, given that similar logic already exists for s3_prefix.",

One will fail because even the xi_map started with `--port 0` will still bind to port 54230, and thus the \"loser\" sees:\n \n```\n[06/29/25 18:39:27:886][map][critical] Failed to create MapSocket: bind: Only one usage of each socket address (protocol/network address/port) is normally permitted. (MapNetworking::MapNetworking:104)\n```\n\nThis is because of the way dbtool launches zones per unique port specified in xidb, but there is zone 286 which has port 0 because it is a bad zone.\n\nSo if your setting up a brand new db with defaults on a new server with defaults, dbtool sets you up for a race condition.\n\n## Expected behavior\n\n<!-- Add expected behavior here -->\nOut of the box xidb and dbtool should reliably start xi_map for all supported zones.\n",

      "description" : "**Describe the bug**\r\nTalk back is not reading Arabic language in Audio Language dialog box \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Go to 'Place Values'\r\n2. Double tap on 'What are place values'\r\n3. Double tap on 'Audio' button\r\n4. Double tap on 'Change language' icon\r\n5. Audio Language dialog box appears\r\n6. Swipe across the various languages\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nTalk back to read all the language names including Arabic\r\n\r\n\r\n**Environment**\r\nDevice name: One plus Nord2 5G\r\nAndroid version : Android 11\r\nApp version : 0.7-alpha-d1b2827517\r\n\r\n**Explanation and suggested solution**\r\nIn `LanguageDialogFragment`, we use ` appLanguageResourceHandler.computeLocalizedDisplayName(audioLanguage)` to get the display name for ecah language. The Arabic language therefore is displayed in Arabic characters, which talkback, when localized to English, cannot read. \r\n\r\nTalkback relies on content descriptions where available, but since this list is dynamic, we can use an accessibility delegate to instruct talkback on how to read Arabic(and Hindi too).\r\n\r\nWhen creating the dialog, override the accessibility properties of the list items by accessing the AlertDialog's ListView after creation:\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\nval options = languageNameArrayList.toTypedArray<CharSequence>()\r\nval languageInterface: LanguageInterface = parentFragment as AudioFragment\r\n\r\nval alertDialog = AlertDialog.Builder(ContextThemeWrapper(activity as Context, R.style.OppiaDialogFragmentTheme))\r\n  ...\r\n    .create()\r\n\r\nalertDialog.setOnShowListener {\r\n    val listView = alertDialog.listView\r\n    for (i in 0 until listView.childCount) {\r\n        val item = listView.getChildAt(i)\r\n        item?.setAccessibilityDelegate(object : View.AccessibilityDelegate() {\r\n            override fun onInitializeAccessibilityNodeInfo(\r\n                host: View?,\r\n                info: AccessibilityNodeInfo?\r\n            ) {\r\n                super.onInitializeAccessibilityNodeInfo(host, info)\r\n                // Get the item text\r\n           \r\n                // Set content description for TalkBack\r\n                        }\r\n        })\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nreturn alertDialog\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nUI tests are expected for the submitted code.\r\n",

For devices where this setting is not set to Arabic, this results in any Arabic words being skipped.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-07-12 at 12 38 19 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17b33f5d-1e10-4ab2-b33b-042bbd90f4c9)\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the current behavior means that the other languages in the list _aren't_ being read in their native TTS languages, which can be confusing to understand (eg. the Chinese characters for Mandarin Chinese are read in a hard-to-understand English TTS 'accent'). \r\n\r\n**Proposed Approach**\r\nUpdate `AppLanguageResourceHandler::computeLocalizedDisplayName` so that it returns a `SpannableString` instead of a `String` and wrap the returned string with `LocaleString.` By doing so, we can specify a locale that allows TalkBack to dyanmically switch to the proper TTS voice based on the language. This change would also require updating the `OptionsAudioLanguageViewModel` and `AudioLanguageSelectionViewModel` display language property to use `SpannableString` instead of `String.` \r\n\r\nLet me know if these are the methods/files that should be updated in this fix, thanks!\r\n\r\n", "Hi @elin4046, thanks for researching this. I have a few follow ups:\r\n- Typically, we don't use Locale directly in the codebase. However, if you can create a function in  the `OppiaLocale` class, it might work.\r\n- Configuring locale specific tts voice is technically out of scope for this issue. However, if it is an automatic side effect of the fix, then we can test it out and get product feedback on it. \r\n\r\n\r\nDo you mind  trying this fix and doing a screen recording so we can see what it is like?\r\n\r\n**Additional Context**\r\nThe Oppia app is set up to use the device language by default, and if the device is configure in mandarin for example, most tts will be in mandarin. However, for app strings, mandarin is not one of the translated languages we currently support, and talkback relies on content descriptions to describe the app, so for untranslated strings will default to English.", "@theayushyadav11, here's another issue to look at.

That would have the benefit of keeping the Briefcase docs on the Briefcase page, but would ensure that multiple versions say aligned.", "Thinking out loud....\r\n\r\nWhat if we leverage git submodules?\r\n\r\nIn this way, a new repo would contain the common documentation and the project repos would add this new repo as a submodule; then the docs could be built using a single source of truth for common documentation.\r\n\r\nFor instance: https://github.com/davidfischer/sphinx-with-submodules", "Put together a quick PoC.\r\n\r\nIn a [copy](https://github.com/rmartin16/briefcase-test) of the Briefcase repo, I added a new [repo](https://github.com/rmartin16/beeware-common-docs-test) as a [submodule](https://github.com/rmartin16/briefcase-test/tree/main/docs) in the `docs` directory. Then, I [reference](https://github.com/rmartin16/briefcase-test/blob/467fafe36679c579c0400f20603654295785e2a1/docs/index.rst?plain=1#L18) the `common-1.rst` file from the Briefcase's `index.rst`.\r\n\r\nproject repo: https://github.com/rmartin16/briefcase-test\r\ncommon doc repo: https://github.com/rmartin16/beeware-common-docs-test\r\n\r\nThis all works rather seamlessly, IMO. There will need to be a workflow to bump the submodule commit in the project repos when the common doc repo is updated, though.\r\n\r\n[edit] I guess a major issue this is likely to create is unaware contributors trying to build docs without the submodule....since `git` apparently doesn't clone submodules by default. So, anyone trying to build docs will need to run `git submodule update --init` or have run `git clone --recurse-submodules` initially...", "> What if we leverage git submodules?\r\n\r\nThat's definitely one way to avoid reproducing content; I'm not sure how I feel about it, though. I've historically avoided submodules unless I absolutely have to use them - I've found them to be one of those features that superficially works, but ends up making your life a whole lot more complicated in the long run (especially for contributors that haven't got experience with submodules - which is most of them).\r\n\r\nAt the risk of re-inventing the wheel - I wonder if it might be more reliable to use the same general approach, but build the subrepo cloning part as a build pre-processing step using regular git cloning.", "> I've found them to be one of those features that superficially works, but ends up making your life a whole lot more complicated in the long run (especially for contributors that haven't got experience with submodules - which is most of them).\r\n\r\nThis is fair and definitely one of my concerns for a submodule.\r\n\r\n> At the risk of re-inventing the wheel - I wonder if it might be more reliable to use the same general approach, but build the subrepo cloning part as a build pre-processing step using regular git cloning.\r\n\r\nhmm...this definitely ventures in to wheel reinvention territory.\r\n\r\nWhile this approach avoids the submodule, it introduces ambiguities that the submodule makes explicit. Notably, the current version of the \"common docs\" incorporated in to any single project's published docs is implicit. Now, we can create workflows around ensuring any updates committed to the \"common docs\" are more or less immediately pushed to dependent repos....but that doesn't remove the inherent implicit nature of which version of the \"common docs\" is being used.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if we're willing to automate the management of pulling and building docs from a remote repo, then it seems much more trivial to simply have `tox` ensure the submodule is initialized and updated prior to building the docs....rather than trying to manually clone a repo and add it to the project's docs.\r\n\r\nBut, even then, the \"common docs\" commit used for the submodule in a project repo still needs to be maintained. So, either way, we need a process to ensure updates in the \"common docs\" are disseminated to relevant repos and their docs are republished.\r\n\r\nGiven the submodule is only necessary to build the docs...and the only real way to build the docs is to run `tox`, I think much of the concern of contributors getting caught up in having to understand submodules can be avoided. That said, I don't have strong feelings and don't have much experience managing a submodule over time.", "> > At the risk of re-inventing the wheel - I wonder if it might be more reliable to use the same general approach, but build the subrepo cloning part as a build pre-processing step using regular git cloning.\r\n> \r\n> hmm...this definitely ventures in to wheel reinvention territory.\r\n> \r\n> While this approach avoids the submodule, it introduces ambiguities that the submodule makes explicit.\r\n\r\nThat would depend a bit on the implementation - we could make our implementation use specific git hash or similar. However, at the very least, a non-trivial re-implementation of a not-insignificant portion of git submodules would be required.\r\n\r\n> Given the submodule is only necessary to build the docs...and the only real way to build the docs is to run `tox`, I think much of the concern of contributors getting caught up in having to understand submodules can be avoided. \r\n\r\nThat's a fair point. My experience is that the core git submodule implementation \"works\" - it's just near-impossible for a normal human to consistently drive correctly. These problems stem from the fact that submodules aren't deeply integrated into the \"default\" git workflow, so you end up with stale checkouts, or incompatible checkouts, or something else like that. \r\n\r\nIf we can make the existence of the submodules completely transparent to the end user - so running `tox e docs/docs-lint/docs-live` *completely* manages submodule cloning, updating, etc; and the existence of the submodule doesn't impact on any other development behavior (e.g., causing issues switching between branches), then this might be an approach worth pursuing.\r\n", "A sync between the Toga and Briefcase contribution guides is in progress. \n\nThere is a somewhat significant amount of duplicated content between the two code contribution guides, and the documentation guides are 99.9% the same. I feel the idea of consolidating content is a discussion worth continuing.\n\nI put some time into looking into whether there were any options, inherent to Sphinx, available for consolidating content. As far as I can tell, Sphinx does not support any features that would do this natively. Directly cloning the repo would avoid submodules, but the issue of being able to edit the common docs in the wrong location seems as possible with this method as with submodules. Other than this issue, the rest could be made relatively transparent to the user.\n\nAnother issue that came up is searchability. Users have reported that it's difficult to find info with the docs being spread across multiple repos. Something that is worth looking into for this are [Read the Docs subprojects](https://docs.readthedocs.com/platform/stable/subprojects.html). This would require having a \"primary\" documentation repo, perhaps on `beeware/beeware`, that the rest of the tools are added to as subprojects. Then, the docs would be searchable across all projects - the project-wide search is available from the \"primary\" project, as well as any of the subprojects. The search has a checkbox for \"Include subprojects\" and that is how you choose to search all the projects at once - there is an [active issue](https://github.com/readthedocs/addons/issues/22) open to add the ability to configure it to be checked by default. This change may effect some of the plan [here](https://github.com/beeware/beeware/discussions/522#discussioncomment-13502604), so it's something we would need to discuss. ", "> Another issue that came up is searchability. Users have reported that it's difficult to find info with the docs being spread across multiple repos.\n\nOnce the docs are all moved to beeware.org subdomains, it'll become possible to do this with an external search engine that supports filtering by domain, e.g. Google has `site:beeware.org`." ],

We’ve noticed that other users have reported similar issues, as seen in the forum thread you are mentioning. However, we kindly ask that such discussions be continued there in order to keep issues at one place and as this tracker is intended for framework-related issues. Once solution is found and its only a matter of integration, a PR https://github.com/armbian/build/pulls should be opened - by anyone.\n\nThis particular bug appears to be tied to the specific hardware/kernel combination and not related to Armbian OS or assembly itself. It's worth noting that this issue does not manifest on Raspberry Pi or x86 platforms, which benefit from significantly larger development resources — for instance, Raspberry Pi OS has a dedicated full-time staff and a yearly budget exceeding 1 million USD. In contrast, Armbian relies heavily on community support and volunteer contributions with budget ([taken from here](https://github.com/sponsors/armbian)). And we compile 80 different kernels for docents of platforms. Most of them are not even close to level of Raspberry Pi. And even there, users finds issues https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/issues\n\nAs frustrating as it may be, the reality in open source is that some issues—especially those requiring deep investigation—can take years to resolve. We fully understand the inconvenience and appreciate your patience and contributions." ],

Moreover, i tested setting `automaticallyWaitsToMinimizeStalling` to false but it doesn't work. \r\nWhat i understood is that if i put `preferredForwardBufferDuration=15` it means that the player will load 15 video seconds into the memory before continue playing the video but it doesn't work like that. It seems that preferredForwardBufferDuration is always in 0\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Platform\r\n<!--\r\niOS AVplayer\r\n-->\r\nWhich player are you experiencing the problem on:\r\n* iOS real device (iPhone 11).\r\n\r\n## Environment info\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Run `react-native info` in your terminal and copy the results here.

Like how anyone can make a Docker image without publishing it to the Docker Hub.\n\nAnother metric could be the interaction with the [`appimage.github.io` repo](https://github.com/AppImage/appimage.github.io/), where users can submit PRs to include AppImages in the list.", "Google trends:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa9182f0-3ecf-4a56-adc4-618a25fe6dab)\n\nWill this do?", "Yep, that certainly looks good enough to me, @prem-k-r \uD83D\uDC4D\uD83C\uDFFB " ],

However, when editing the name of the task, sometimes the app lets you keep the line break on it.\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d4a8beb-35d4-4f34-8042-5e5e31deeaaa\n\nThis example was a simplification of the issue, but some apps / sites add a invisible line break after the copied text, so this issue might appear more often.\n\n(TBH it doesn't seem like this is a deal breaker, but I can imagine this having some potential issues if any other area of the app is not expecting line breaks at all on this field, so I am creating this issue just in case).\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Open any Note-taking app to test this out\n2. Write any sentence in two lines, with an Enter line-break. Example:\n\n```\nthis is \na test\n```\n\n3. Copy this text\n4. Add a new task in Super Productivity\n5. Paste the text on the name field of the task, and save (pressing Enter or clicking away from the task field)\nYou will notice that the line breaks got stripped down and the text is in a single line\n7. Select the name field of the task again, and paste the text again on it.\nYou _should_ notice that the text is now in multiple lines.\n\n### Can you reproduce this reliably?\n\nYes, I can reproduce it reliably.\n\n### Console Output\n\n```shell\n\n```",

This causes delays, unnecessary follow-ups, and risks around incorrect or incomplete releases.\nWe believe we already know the core information needed to initiate a release (e.g., release identifier, target component, identity version). By formalizing how this is collected, we can empower engineers to submit higher-quality requests and reduce the coordination burden on the release manager.\nWhat we aim to do in this task:\nDefine the minimum required fields engineers must provide when requesting a release (e.g., release identifier, target component, identity version). Create a lightweight, accessible format for collecting this information, for example a Slack form. Align with the release manager to ensure this structure covers all needed details.\n\n## Goal\n\nA clearly documented and easy-to-use mechanism for engineers to request a release, integrated into our current channel #top-monorepo-release.\n",

I always got the error message although the label was there.\n\n> Invalid branch label \"name\" detected on line 123\n\nDigging around in the code I think I have discovered the root cause. If there is a whitespace after the colon, the line is not detected to contain a label since [this check](https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/blob/2819790e13ca853b1141a7d59d45e426878a4a91/src/dbg/simplescript.cpp#L220) fails.\n\nMaybe this also causes some problems with other commands.\n\nA quick-and-dirty fix could be to add the following in place of line [210](https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/blob/2819790e13ca853b1141a7d59d45e426878a4a91/src/dbg/simplescript.cpp#L210):\n\n```c\nint rawlen = (int)strlen(cur.raw);\n// Remove trailing whitespace\nwhile ((rawlen > 0) && isspace(cur.raw[rawlen - 1]))\n{\n\trawlen--;\n}\n```\n\nBut I leave that to you.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Write any script that has both a label and a JMP/CALL et.c to that label\n2. Add whitespace after colon\n3. Parser will not recognize label and fail\n\n\n### Attachments\n\n_No response_",

I will write a brief TypeScript test to confirm that math.unit(5) compiles and yields a dimensionless Unit, and update the docs to illustrate this use.

An important piece is the [PackageInfoMapper](https://github.com/tuist/tuist/blob/main/cli/Sources/TuistLoader/SwiftPackageManager/PackageInfoMapper.swift) that does the majority of the mapping from SwiftPM definition to the Tuist definition. This mapping currently does not support SwiftPM plugins.

The [W3C specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context-2/#trace-flags) for the flags only contains two flags, and it's my understanding that the `sampled` flag isn't particularly meaningful at the point where we're processing data in the Collector (it must necessarily be `1` since we have the trace).\r\n\r\nFrom what I can tell, we should offer a read-only `flags.random_trace_id` field or similar that provides a boolean representation of the `random-trace-id` flag.", "Reading more of the [field definition](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/blob/main/opentelemetry/proto/trace/v1/trace.proto#L114), it looks like there are a few more flags that can be stored in the field, but I still think we should consider offering paths for each flag. We could potentially offer something like `flags.raw_value` or similar for direct access to the bit sequence.", "@evan-bradley to start can we implement it like we implemented [flags for logs](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/421d710d3d8ceb28e375f57109ae976423713f9d/pkg/ottl/contexts/ottllog/log.go#L468-L480)", "Didn't realize logs had a flags field as well, thanks for pointing that out.

Reading out the flags as an integer doesn't seem immediately useful to me, I'm not clear what a user would be able to do with the raw value. Also since there are only a limited set of flags, it would probably make sense to have OTTL pull them out individually since we don't have the bitwise operations necessary to allow users to read them in a statement.\r\n2. Right now [the logs proto field](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/blob/main/opentelemetry/proto/logs/v1/logs.proto#L185) says it only contains W3C trace context flags, which I've been told should be considered read-only in Collector processors until someone comes to us with a compelling use case for writing to them. At a minimum, without bitwise operators they're going to be hard to work with.\r\n\r\nUnless users are looking for only access to the raw bit sequence, I think we should consider implementing something different for traces and look to update the logs context to match once we're happy with it.", "> Are you ware of any usages of that field\r\n\r\nI am not.\r\n\r\nIf the current logs implementation is not useful I am ok with implementing flags for spans with specific flags in mind, but I do think we should make a generic path like logs in case there is some custom function someone wants to build that does something with the raw flags.", "This issue has been inactive for 60 days.

It has good browser support and would allow us to marginally reduce the bundle size.\n\n---------------\n\n_Do not alter or remove anything below. The following sections will be managed by moderators only._\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n\n* Use of `cloneDeep` within the codebase should be replaced with `structuredClone`.\n\n## Implementation Brief\n\n* Wait until we upgrade our version of Node to at least `17` (probably `18`), see #6026.\n* Replace every import of `cloneDeep` with `structuredClone`, eg `cloneDeep( object )` to `structuredClone( object )`.\n* At the time of writing, we have usage in the following files:\n  * `assets/js/modules/analytics-4/datastore/properties.test.js`\n  * `assets/js/modules/analytics-4/components/module/ModulePopularPagesWidgetGA4/index.js`\n  * `assets/js/modules/analytics-4/components/dashboard/DashboardAllTrafficWidgetGA4/UserCountGraph.js`\n  * `assets/js/modules/analytics-4/components/dashboard/DashboardAllTrafficWidgetGA4/UserDimensionsPieChart.js`\n  * `assets/js/modules/analytics-4/utils/data-mock.js`\n  * `assets/js/modules/reader-revenue-manager/components/settings/SettingsEdit.stories.js`\n  * `assets/js/modules/reader-revenue-manager/datastore/publications.test.js`\n  * `assets/js/components/GoogleChart/utils.js`\n  * `assets/js/components/wp-dashboard/WPDashboardPopularPagesGA4.js`\n  * `storybook/utils/resetGlobals.js`\n\n### Test Coverage\n\n* Tests should continue to pass without change; no new tests are needed.\n\n## QA Brief\n\n* <!-- One or more bullet points for how to test that the feature works as expected. -->\n\n## Changelog entry\n\n* <!-- One sentence summarizing the PR, to be used in the changelog. -->\n",

At the time LTS was 16, but I think it's worth exploring an upgrade to 18 as some other updates depend on a newer version as well.\r\n\r\nThen we can implement this according to the IB.

You need an event (watcher or vue lifecycle) to call the function which adds the css class. In my case the taskDates prop is updated each time the user changes the current month. I guess it is a common implementation. Hope it will help you\r\n" ],

Still, the issue remains that once you press `Enter` in any of the input fields (or click the arrow button) there is no easy way to undo any changes - as @yskwon38  also stated.\r\n\r\nBut to me it seems now that the missing `Cancel` button is only a symptom of a larger issue, namely that the user editing UI is not very intuitive and actually confusing.\r\nI think the fact that you had to create an elaborate screenshot and write some text explaining how user editing works kind of supports my opinion.\r\nI know, one should read the manual, but I would think that editing a user should be a straight-forward task that requires little to no documentation at all.\r\n\r\nAnother example: I edit a user, change the user name, and click on `Done`. I reload the page and my change is gone / hasn't been saved. In this case the `Done` button actually **is** the `Cancel` button. No other form I used so far behaves this way.\r\n\r\nIn other (user) editing forms I usually see two different approaches:\r\n1. Editing a field and moving on to the next field (`onblur`) directly persists the changes\r\n2. Changes are only persisted after clicking a `Save` button at the end of the form. Clicking the `Cancel` button resets all changes made so far.\r\n\r\nI would like to suggest to change the NC user editing to the second approach. The currently used approach where one has to manually \"apply\" changes for every single input field by clicking the `arrow` button (without having the chance of undoing it) is - at least for me - a counter-intuitive approach, which leads to a sometimes frustrating user experience. Because it is so different from what I am used to from other forms and user editing is not a task that I do so often that I will get used to this approach. Basically, I have to think \"how did this work again?\" every time I start using NC's user management.\r\n\r\nAnd I am not sure if a simple re-labelling or adding tooltips to buttons will actually be enough to improve this. See my example above where the `Done` button label would actually have to get a different label depending on whether any input fields were edited **and** saved (`Done`) or just edited but **not** saved (`Cancel`).", "> But to me it seems now that the missing `Cancel` button is only a symptom of a larger issue, namely that the user editing UI is not very intuitive and actually confusing.\r\n> I think the fact that you had to create an elaborate screenshot and write some text explaining how user editing works kind of supports my opinion.\r\n> I know, one should read the manual, but I would think that editing a user should be a straight-forward task that requires little to no documentation at all.\r\n\r\nI think there might have been a misunderstanding.

I reload the page and my change is gone / hasn't been saved. In this case the `Done` button actually **is** the `Cancel` button. No other form I used so far behaves this way.\r\n\r\nI agree with you - this is exactly how I found out the `Done` button does nothing. I was changing field values and then clicking the `Done` button and it was very confusing that my updates were not being saved.\r\n\r\n> And I am not sure if a simple re-labelling or adding tooltips to buttons will actually be enough to improve this.\r\n\r\nI didn't say that it was enough - rather that it would be an incremental improvement over what is there now.

My apologies.\r\n\r\nYou are also correct, that when writing the original feature request I missed that there already is kind of a `Cancel` button. It just has a confusing label: the checkmark icon and the `Done` tooltip.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is only true for the text fields. The multi-select fields for group and group admin persist any changes immediately.\r\nSo that is another confusing inconsistency, I think.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I would still prefer a solution that gets rid of the `arrow` buttons and any auto-save-on-change completely, and just uses one `Save` and one `Cancel` button for the whole form.\r\n\r\nBut as you said, it might make sense to discuss such a change first with the nextcloud team before starting to work on it.\r\n", "I think there should be only one way to save changes and the \"done\" checkmark should be the way to go.

Kolibri's [search input clear button](https://github.com/learningequality/kolibri/blob/242459d5062202a3ec6af5056271f91d90beafe5/packages/kolibri-common/components/SearchBox.vue#L20-L40) is a good example.\n\n## Out of Scope\n\n- Do not refactor any other areas of the codebase\n- Do not modify `CopyToken`\n\n## Expected UI/UX changes\n\n- Minor visual differences naturally stemming from the use of KDS\n- When loading, instead of the blue linear loader on the bottom of the input, there will be a circular loader displayed in the place of the input\n\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n\n**General**\n\n- [ ] The specification above is followed.\n- [ ] Except for \"Expected UI/UX changes,\" there are no functional or visual differences in user experience.\n- [ ] All user interactions are manually tested with no regressions.\n- [ ] Pull request includes screenshots.\n\n**a11y and i18n**\n\nSee [the project](https://github.com/learningequality/studio/issues/5060)'s \"Guidance\" for useful references.\n\n- [ ] Implementation meets a11y standards\n- [ ] All components are LTR and RTL compliant\n- [ ] All user-facing strings are translated properly\n- [ ] The `notranslate` class been added to elements that shouldn't be translated by Google Chrome's automatic translation feature (e.g. user-generated text)\n- [ ] Mobile experience is reasonable\n\n**Unit tests**\n- [ ] If there is a unit test suite already, it is meaningfully updated (even if tests don't fail)\n- [ ] If there is no unit test suite, a new one is created",

      "description" : "## Issue summary\n- While designing the statement distribution subsystem I've noticed that it needs to send messages to `Candidate Backing` subsystems, and after a look into the `Candidate Backing` it will also need to send messages to `Statement Distribution`\n\n- Currently, in Gossamer we have packages contains a filed `message.go` that contains all the messages the subsystem can receive, and other packages that contains an inner package called `messages` that holds a file called `messages.go` that contains the messages.\n\n- In a case where two subsystems should send messages to each other they need to import the receiving subsystem to be able to instantiate the message and sent, so if all the messages stay in the subsystem package this will create an cyclic import\n\n\n## Implementation details\n\n- We should use the second approach where the subsystem has an inner package called `messages` to avoid such case.\n\n## Other information and links\n<!-- Add any other context, links or screenshots about the issue here. -->\n- `Backing -> Statement Distribution`: [link to the code](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/ec69b612bfa082ada07ceb7d8115e07f943f6815/polkadot/node/core/backing/src/lib.rs#L1697)\n- `Statement Distribution -> Backing`: [link to the code](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/ec69b612bfa082ada07ceb7d8115e07f943f6815/polkadot/node/network/statement-distribution/src/v2/mod.rs#L1959)\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n<!-- Acceptance criteria establish conditions to fulfill for the item to be complete. Usually can be a list of checkboxes.\nPlease refer to DOD for general implementation issue:\n- AC should be complete so list everything that this issue suppose to have\n- 60% test coverage. No less then 60% of coverage for newly added lines\n- If applicable Regression testing. If this issue can be tested by its won mention Regression testing. \nAcceptance criteria should be added as a check boxes (eg [] Do this) \n-->\n[] Move all the messages for each subsystems to the `messages` pkg\n\n<!-- Thank you \uD83D\uDE4F -->",

      "description" : "While implementing the new UI for bug reporting phase in [#1312](https://github.com/CATcher-org/CATcher/pull/1312), I noticed some places that I could be further improved in terms of code quality, mainly the following 2 aspects:\n\n- Duplication of code between `deleteIssue` and `undeleteIssue`, they are essentially performing the same actions, but in reverse directions, hence the code is highly duplicated. \n- There are 2 separate lists `issuesPendingDeletion` and `issuesPendingRestore`, which is used for displaying the loading icon (instead of the delete/restore icon), we can actually merge these 2 lists into a single list (maybe `issuesPendingAction`?) instead and display the loading icon  (and hide the delete/restore icon) based on this list\n- There is a lot of conditional logic in the `issue-tables.component.html` file, we should probably move these logic into the `issue-tables.component.ts` file instead. See the `*ngIf=...`\n\n<img width=\"1100\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3075c04-2f08-4e52-a55d-82d425131116\" />",

This is a place to report bugs to developers, after your server has been debugged. You can find help debugging your system on our home user forums: https://help.nextcloud.com or, if you use Nextcloud in a large organization, ask our engineers on https://portal.nextcloud.com. See also  https://nextcloud.com/support for support options.\r\n\r\nNextcloud is an open source project backed by Nextcloud GmbH. Most of our volunteers are home users and thus primarily care about issues that affect home users. Our paid engineers prioritize issues of our customers. If you are neither a home user nor a customer, consider paying somebody to fix your issue, do it yourself or become a customer.\r\n\r\nGuidelines for submitting issues:\r\n\r\n* Please search the existing issues first, it's likely that your issue was already reported or even fixed.\r\n    - Go to https://github.com/nextcloud and type any word in the top search/command bar. You probably see something like \"We couldn’t find any repositories matching ...\" then click \"Issues\" in the left navigation.\r\n    - You can also filter by appending e. g. \"state:open\" to the search string.\r\n    - More info on search syntax within github: https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues\r\n    \r\n* This repository https://github.com/nextcloud/server/issues is *only* for issues within the Nextcloud Server code.

      "description" : "### ⚠️ This issue respects the following points: ⚠️\n\n- [x] This is a **bug**, not a question or a configuration/webserver/proxy issue.\n- [x] This issue is **not** already reported on [Github](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug) OR [Nextcloud Community Forum](https://help.nextcloud.com/) _(I've searched it)_.\n- [x] Nextcloud Server **is** up to date. See [Maintenance and Release Schedule](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/wiki/Maintenance-and-Release-Schedule) for supported versions.\n- [x] I agree to follow Nextcloud's [Code of Conduct](https://nextcloud.com/contribute/code-of-conduct/).\n\n### Bug description\n\nWhen opening `/settings/user/security` below the devices and sessions section the connected devices and sessions are listed. In this section are entries like `Google Chrome - 132 (Linux)`. The entry is added as soon as the Nextcloud mobile app is connected to the Nextcloud installation and the username and password is entered in the mobile Chrome browser.\n\nThis is misleading. I think, it should be `Google Chrome - 132 (Android)`. Linux makes me think of a desktop computer or laptop running Linux.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Set up a recent Nextcloud AIO\n2. Login into the Nextcloud web interface on a desktop computer or laptop that is not running Linux and go to `/settings/user/security`\n3. Install the Nextcloud app on an Android device\n4. Make sure Google Chrome is the default browser on the Android device\n5. Enter the server address in the Nextcloud app to connect to it\n6. Wait for the Chrome browser on the Android device to open\n7. Authenticate yourself and grant access to the Nextcloud app\n8. Reload `/settings/user/security` on your desktop computer or laptop and you will see `Google Chrome - <version> (Linux)`\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nGoogle Chrome on Android should be reported as `Google Chrome - <version> (Android)' \n\nI don't have appropriate test devices but on iOS and iPadOS I would expect something like `Google Chrome - <version> (iOS)`,  `Apple Safari - <version> (iPadOS)`, and so on\n\n### Nextcloud Server version\n\n29\n\n### Operating system\n\nOther\n\n### PHP engine version\n\nNone\n\n### Web server\n\nNone\n\n### Database engine version\n\nNone\n\n### Is this bug present after an update or on a fresh install?\n\nFresh Nextcloud Server install\n\n### Are you using the Nextcloud Server Encryption module?\n\nEncryption is Disabled\n\n### What user-backends are you using?\n\n- [ ] Default user-backend _(database)_\n- [x] LDAP/ Active Directory\n- [ ] SSO - SAML\n- [ ] Other\n\n### Configuration report\n\n```json\n\n```\n\n### List of activated Apps\n\n```shell\n\n```\n\n### Nextcloud Signing status\n\n```shell\n\n```\n\n### Nextcloud Logs\n\n```json\n\n```\n\n### Additional info\n\n_No response_",

      "description" : "### Question\n\nHi! I am trying to add 1 million existing Parquet files to an Iceberg table using the `add_files` procedure. I am inserting in 1000 batches of 1000 files. Every batch takes longer than the previous batch, and at this point each batch is taking around 1-2 minutes. This is much much slower than Spark, which remains consistent throughout the entire insertion. How can I speed this up? The Parquet files already have metadata so perhaps that could be exploited somehow? Below is the code I am using:\n\n\n```\nwarehouse_path = \"/warehouse\"\ncatalog = load_catalog(\n    \"pyiceberg\",\n    **{\n        'type': 'sql',\n        \"uri\": f\"sqlite:///{warehouse_path}/pyiceberg_catalog.db\",\n        \"warehouse\": f\"file://{warehouse_path}\",\n    },\n)\ncatalog.create_namespace_if_not_exists(\"default\")\n\n# Load the batches of files to import\nbatches = os.listdir(args.file_dir)\nfirst_file = os.path.join(args.file_dir, \"batch_0\", os.listdir(os.path.join(args.file_dir, \"batch_0\"))[0])\n\n# Create table using schema of the first file\ndf = pq.read_table(first_file)\ntable = catalog.create_table_if_not_exists(\n    f\"default.{args.table}\",\n    schema=df.schema,\n)\n\nbatch_idx = 1\nfor batch_dir in batches:\n    print(f\"Adding batch {batch_idx}\")\n    batch_dir =  os.path.join(args.file_dir, batch_dir)\n    file_paths = os.listdir(batch_dir)\n    file_paths = [batch_dir + '/' + s for s in file_paths]\n    table.add_files(file_paths=file_paths)\n    batch_idx += 1\n```",

If anybody wants to take a stab, you can search for `scrollUpMain` in the codebase to see how that works. We need versions of `scrollUpView` and `scrollDownView` in `pkg/gui/global_handlers.go` that take the scroll amount as a parameter, rather than hardcoding to use `gui.UserConfig.Gui.ScrollHeight` internally. Then we can pass them the height of the view as that parameter to have us scrolling by a whole page.", "btw @sdegutis if you want to get your hands dirty with Go, this would be a good first start!", "Sorry, to clarify, I'm requesting we use <kbd>Shift-PageUp</kbd> and <kbd>Shift-PageDown</kbd> (or Ctrl-).", "Tbh I mainly solved this by just setting scroll amount to 10 in config instead of the default of 2 and using the mouse wheel to scroll, so this can be closed if you want.", "By the way @jesseduffield when I looked through the src earlier, I was surprised this was written in Go.

I've had enough exposure to Rust to feel that Go is sorely lacking in features. Especially when it comes to code re-use, Go just doesn't have much (if anything) to offer due to lack of both inheritance, mixins/traits, and generics (though generics are on the way). I've done a fairly extensive writeup on my thoughts [here](https://jesseduffield.com/Gos-Shortcomings-1/) \r\n\r\n@glendsoza Nice one. I've left a comment on that PR. As commented, there's another PR in flight that's going to make it easier to use shift/ctrl modifiers, and hopefully that'll let us use pgdown/pgup.", "@jesseduffield I agree, I came to that conclusion maybe 7 years ago. I tried Rust out and I guess it's fine if you need low-level and lightning-fast and ultra-safe code, which I do 0% of the time (and apparently neither does VS Code but it works well enough). I'm going to try my hand at a quick Electron git client in TypeScript one of these days using [simple-git](https://www.npmjs.com/package/simple-git).", "I also vote for hotkeys for whole page scrolling. `C-f/C-b` (like manpage)  and `C-u/C-d` (like tig) both feels right to me. It should be configurable so there should just be a default one and let users choose what they like.", "@jesseduffield -- any update on this one? It'd be really lovely to be able to scroll by whole pages.", "As of v0.50 you can now focus the main view (by pressing `0`), and then you can navigate it using all the normal navigation keys like `.` and `,` for scrolling by page, or `<` and `>` for beginning/end.", "Given that we do now have a way of scrolling the main view both by line and by page via focusing it, I wonder if we should update the page-up/page-down keys to actually scroll by page now. Seems like lots of people are surprised that it currently defaults to only scrolling by line.\n\nOn the other hand, lots of lazygit users (myself included) have become accustomed to page-up/page-down only scrolling by lines", "@jesseduffield In this comment you only talk about scrolling by line vs. scrolling by page, but isn't the bigger difference which view they operate on? I'd expect pgup/pgdown to scroll the _current_ view (by page of course, not by line), not the main view. They would then do exactly the same as `,` and `.`, in the same way as home and end do the same as `<` and `>`.\n\nThis change makes a lot of sense to me, and I'm in favor. We still have two other ways of scrolling the main view (ctrl-d/u and J/K; they are both listed in the keybinding cheat sheets, but are otherwise not very discoverable).\n\nBut I'm probably not qualified to judge, because I rarely use the keyboard to scroll the main view; I use two fingers on the trackpad for that.", "As a vim user, I'm accustomed to `ctrl+u` and `ctrl+d` scrolling by _half pages_, and that is what I expected in the lazygit diff view (instead, it scrolls one line, just like pg up/dn). I'm very much in favor of making these scroll by page in the diff view. \n\nWhen I'm staging files for a commit, I'd like to quickly move from file to file, while being able to scroll quickly in the diff without having to switch focus back and forth between the panes. \n\nIdeally, scrolling by line should also be available somehow in this view. One suggestion would be to use `ctrl+e` and `ctrl+y` to scroll by line, just like in vim, however, I see that `ctrl+e` is already in use. `ctrl+j` and `ctrl+k` could also be agreeable, and seems to be available.", "We could also scroll alternative views by alt+down/up or ctrl+down/up", "I think a modifier + any-navigation keys applying to the current view would be good.\n\n`ctrl + ,` or `ctrl + .` applying to current view would be great. I also think we should have an alternative for line scrolling on the current view, page-up/down should really do what they say on the box imo.\n\n... I should really offer a PR rather than my opinion", "> As of v0.50 you can now focus the main view (by pressing `0`), and then you can navigate it using all the normal navigation keys like `.` and `,` for scrolling by page, or `<` and `>` for beginning/end.\n\nThanks, that's perfect!" ],

This would allow an automated script to automatically 'ping' (by using @`GitHubUsername`) these people in a GitHub comment, at an appropriate point. For instance, this could happen when a new version of a package is added to the package distribution, or when a certain automated test fails for a package. This isn't something we could easily do by email.\r\n\r\nI would be happy for my GitHub username to be included into the `PackageInfo.g` files of the packages to which I contribute.\r\n\r\nDoes this actually require any technical change to GAP, or does it just require people to start doing it?", "Just requires us doing it (well, and agreeing where to out it).

      "description" : "### Motivation\n\nThis issue attempt to reduce the gap of unit tests to cover the code. There is a brief architecture of ut in `tests/ut/` already. We need to add more to cover all the code in vllm-ascend, and there are several principles to follow:\n\n1. The overall file tree should be consistent with `vllm_ascend`\n2. The file name should be the original file name with a prefix `test_`\n3. Use `unittest` framework, make good use of mock\n4. The UTs are all running on cpu node, mock the function related to device to host\n\n### Unit tests need to add\n\n- [ ] |-- test__version.py\n- [x] |-- test_ascend_config.py\n- [ ] |-- test_attention\n- [ ] |   |-- test_attention.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_attention_v1.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_mla_v1.py\n- [ ] |-- compilation\n- [ ] |   `-- test_piecewise_backend.py\n- [ ] |-- core\n- [ ] |   |-- test_schedule_config.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_scheduler.py\n- [ ] |-- device_allocator\n- [ ] |   `-- test_camem.py\n- [ ] |-- distributed\n- [ ] |   |-- test_communicator.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_device_communicators\n- [ ] |   |   |-- test_pyhccl.py\n- [ ] |   |   `-- test_pyhccl_wrapper.py\n- [ ] |   |-- kv_transfer @Agonixiaoxiao \n- [ ] |   |   |-- test_simple_buffer.py\n- [ ] |   |   |-- test_simple_connector.py\n- [ ] |   |   |-- test_simple_pipe.py\n- [ ] |   |   `-- test_utils.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_llmdatadist_connector.py\n- [x] |   `-- test_parallel_state.py   @wangyanhui-cmss \n- [ ] |-- test_envs.py\n- [ ] |-- lora\n- [ ] |   `-- punica_wrapper\n- [ ] |       `-- test_punica_npu.py\n- [ ] |-- models\n- [ ] |   |-- test_deepseek_dbo.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_deepseek_mtp.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_deepseek_v2.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_qwen2_5_vl.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_qwen2_5_vl_without_padding.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_qwen2_vl.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_qwen3_moe.py\n- [ ] |-- multistream\n- [ ] |   |-- test_base.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_context.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_decorator.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_layers.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_metadata.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_ms_split.py\n- [ ] |-- ops\n- [ ] |   |-- test_activation.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_attention.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_cache.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_common_fused_moe.py\n- [x] |   |-- test_expert_load_balancer.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_fused_moe.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_layernorm.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_rotary_embedding.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_vocab_parallel_embedding.py\n- [ ] |-- patch\n- [ ] |   |-- platform\n- [ ] |   |   |-- patch_0_9_1\n- [ ] |   |   |-- patch_common\n- [ ] |   |   |   `-- test_test_patch_distributed.py\n- [ ] |   |   `-- patch_main\n- [ ] |   `-- worker\n- [ ] |       |-- patch_0_9_1\n- [ ] |       |-- patch_common\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_distributed.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_eagle.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_minicpm.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_multi_step_worker.py\n- [x] |       |   |-- test_patch_sampler.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_spec_decode_worker.py\n- [ ] |       |   `-- test_patch_utils.py\n- [ ] |       `-- patch_main\n- [ ] |-- test_platform.py @zhanghw0354\n- [ ] |-- quantization\n- [ ] |   |-- test_func_wrapper.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_quant_config.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_quantizer.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_w8a8.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_w8a8_dynamic.py\n- [ ] |-- sample\n- [ ] |   |-- ops\n- [ ] |   `-- test_rejection_sampler.py\n- [x] |-- test_utils.py\n- [ ] `-- worker \n- [ ] |-- test_cache_engine.py @machenglong2025\n- [ ] |-- test_draft_model_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_model_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_model_runner_v1.py\n- [ ]  |-- test_mtp_proposer_v1.py @machenglong2025\n- [ ] |-- test_multi_step_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_multi_step_worker.py\n- [ ] |-- test_pooling_model_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_worker.py @zhanghw0354\n- [ ] `-- test_worker_v1.py @zhanghw0354\n",

An Ultralytics engineer will review and assist you soon. Thank you for your willingness to contribute! \uD83D\uDEE0️", "Thanks for the detailed analysis! You're absolutely right about the XPU support limitations. The main areas that need updates for full XPU support are:\n\n1. The [`autocast` function](https://docs.ultralytics.com/reference/utils/torch_utils/#ultralytics.utils.torch_utils.autocast) in `torch_utils.py` currently only handles CUDA and CPU devices\n2. The [`check_amp` function](https://docs.ultralytics.com/reference/utils/checks/#ultralytics.utils.checks.check_amp) returns `False` for non-CUDA devices\n3.

Thanks for taking the initiative to get this working!", "@glenn-jocher I am sitting behind a corporate proxy that makes any outside update difficult.  If someone makes the requested changes, I can always test it out with the hardware available to me. Will have to explore internally to see if update is possible.\n\nIn the trainer.py is this a good option? If not, I am seeing a warning, but no other issues. I don't know if xpu supports GradScaler, but the code doesn't produce warning or error.

The variable device is used interchangeably making it difficult. If we give device=0, what does it mean. It could be a GPU or XPU. At present I am passing device=\"xpu\" which limits its usage to one card. There are machines with more than one card.\n\nThere could be a machine with CPU, iGPU, NPU, dGPU (NVIDIA), dGPU (Intel called XPU), dGPU (AMD), and ASIC (Intel HPU) all in one machine. Checking logic like torch.cuda.is_available() or torch.xpu.is_available() or torch.cpu.is_available() will all return true because they are present in the system. This could lead to issues like user specifying device=0 which defaults to CUDA even though user might have selected XPU based on how the workload is running. If the user has done YOLO('yolov8l.pt').to(DEVICE), the DEVICE should be honored across the workflow logic. With what changes are proposed above, setting device=\"xpu\" or device=\"xpu:0\" should work. Selecting device=\"0\" on a XPU machine fails because it defaults to CUDA when it is not available. Multicard training needs further study because theoretically it should be same for CUDA or XPU.", "Thanks for the detailed analysis @azhuvath! I completely understand the corporate proxy constraints - that's a common challenge.\n\nYour GradScaler approach looks good, though I'd suggest checking `self.device.type == \"xpu\"` instead of `torch.xpu.is_available()` to ensure you're actually using an XPU device rather than just having XPU capability available.\n\nYou raise excellent points about the device selection complexity in multi-accelerator systems. The current logic in `select_device` does assume CUDA priority, which isn't ideal for XPU workflows. Your approach of explicitly passing `device=\"xpu\"` is the right pattern for now - it's clear and unambiguous.\n\nSince you're unable to submit PRs directly, perhaps @huahuadeliaoliao could incorporate your working changes into their planned PR? Your attached files provide a solid foundation and the performance results (15x over CPU, 2.5x with AMP) are compelling evidence this implementation works well.\n\nFor multi-XPU support, the pattern should indeed be similar to multi-GPU - handling device strings like `\"xpu:0,1\"` in the device parsing logic, though that can be a follow-up enhancement once basic XPU support is merged.", "@glenn-jocher I tested the changes on Intel Meteor Lake (MTL) iGPU (Integrated Graphics). It is working fine. So it should also work on Intel Lunar Lake (LNL) iGPU.

Having multiple inputs, such as for the NWP forecast grid + raw observations to generate the next analysis grid to more closely match how analysis files are actually generated could be helpful. Additionally, multiple outputs would be helpful, for example for #20 to output both the next NWP state and satellite image, potentially at different resolutions (i.e. HRV vs non-HRV channels for EUMETSAT), or for having more dense local outputs, it could be the global graph, and a local graph output in the decoder.\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n<!--- Why is this change important to you? How would you use it? -->\r\n<!--- How can it benefit other users? -->\r\n\r\n## Possible Implementation\r\nUpdate the latent graph processor to take multiple encoders. Multple outputs can be achieved by taking the output from the graph processor and giving it as inputs into multiple decoders. There would just need to be a way to give multiple decoder configs to the overall model.\r\n",

      "description" : "# Introduction\r\nWelcome to the project, if you pick up this Issue because of the \"GOOD FIRST USE\" label. You will be mentored through the process if you want. First the Issue is explained. At the end you will find some guidance for first contributors. Please do not hesitate to ask questions. Your solution don't need to be perfect.\r\n\r\nParticipation or contribution is not recommended unless you are familiar with Back In Time and are an active user. This project is not intended for learning basic Python skills or enhancing your profile at Microsoft GitHub.\r\n\r\n# Problem & suggested solution\r\nIn the Shortcuts pane, there is Root and Home that open the respective content lists. When BiT is run as user, it points to the user's home folder, which is fine. Run as root, \"Home\" points to root's home folder, which is also fine, but the name is misleading here. It would be more clear to rename that pointer to \"Root\" or \"/root\". To avoid confusion of `/` \"Root\" and `/root` \"Root\", what is now \"Root\" (`/`) ought to be named more specifically, e.g. \"Filesystem\" or \"Root Filesystem\" or \"Filesystem Root\". If space is at a premium, omit the icons.\r\n\r\n# Your next steps\r\n1. If this is your first contribution in this project please introduce your self and tell us about your skills, wishes and plans. Also let us know how you found the issue and the project.\r\n2. Read the existing [contributors documentation](https://github.com/bit-team/backintime/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md).\r\n3. We can develop the next steps in the further discussion. Don't hesitate to ask.\r\n\r\n# Original post\r\n\r\nTwo cosmetic points that might make their way into a general GUI overhaul.\r\n\r\n- Get rid of that pesky \"Main profile\". The name is not meaningful and not editable, so one has to take notes what that profile actually does, or disable it altogether. Still when the GUI is launched, \"Main profile\" is opened first and complains if it can't find its backup folder. That in turn can be mitigated with a dummy backup folder that is always available (I use `/root/.backintime-dummy/` and  `/home/user/.backintime-dummy/`), but this is an ugly situation. I guess \"Main profile\" is a leftover from very early days of BiT when it had a more limited functionality. It' done it's job and can go now.\r\n\r\n- In the Shortcuts pane, there is Root and Home that open the respective content lists. When BiT is run as user, it points to the user's home folder, which is fine. Run as root, \"Home\" points to root's home folder, which is also fine, but the name is misleading here. It would be more clear to rename that pointer to \"Root\" or \"/root\". To avoid confusion of `/` \"Root\" and `/root` \"Root\", what is now \"Root\" (`/`) ought to be named more specifically, e.g. \"Filesystem\" or \"Root Filesystem\" or \"Filesystem Root\".

You can't be sure anymore. And especially in open source projects, there is a lot of AI generated code from star-catching kids around. Sometimes it is hard to distinguish.\n\nOK, than go for it.\n\nFirst of all please check the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/bit-team/backintime/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nThe original issue is a bit broad and confuse because I wasn't sure myself how to solve the problem. It contains several issues and tasks. First of all I would say you can ignore the \"shortcuts pane\" and just work on the \"Root-Mode\" label in the status bar. This is a quit easy and tiny task to begin with. After that we can think about the \"shortcuts pane\".\n\nThe elements in the main window (including the status bar) are all defined in `qt/app.py` ([statusbar is here](https://github.com/bit-team/backintime/blob/de0838beedf8fae7e8970b8f76d37a0af2b2a906/qt/app.py#L287-L295)).

      "description" : "### Prerequisites\n\n- [x] I have written a descriptive issue title\n- [x] I have searched existing issues to ensure the bug has not already been reported\n\n\n### Fastify version\n\n5.2.1\n\n### Plugin version\n\n11.0.2\n\n### Node.js version\n\n22.14.0\n\n### Operating system\n\nmacOS\n\n### Operating system version (i.e. 20.04, 11.3, 10)\n\n15.5\n\n### Description\n\n## Background\n\nWe have a test scenario where our server immediately sends a websocket protocol \"ping\" upon a client connecting as part of starting a heartbeat. Currently the client created by `.injectWS()` does NOT register `ws.on(\"ping\", () => ws.pong())` causing this ping to be lost.\n\n## Attempted Workarounds\n\nWe've tried immediately registering it, but this causes a race condition as we don't get access to the websocket until after the connection has completed:\n\n```ts\nconst ws = server.injectWS(\"/ws\")\nws.on(\"ping\", () => ws.pong())\n```\n\nGiven the flakiness of this, we added a server side delay to starting the heartbeat. This is not ideal but is a sufficient workaround until a proper fix can be done.\n\n## Suggested Fix\n\nIt seems like a one line addition of `ws.on(\"ping\", () => ws.pong())` could be done here where `.on(\"open\", ...)` is already set:\n\nhttps://github.com/fastify/fastify-websocket/blob/90ac47d51d7b72c186311d0c58ded1af42a92a76/index.js#L67-L70\n\n## Impact & Risk of Change\n\nThis seems like a low impact change as no other aspects of testing the websocket outside of the built in ping/pong protocol seem to be impacted by this, as best I can tell. If that impact is still deemed too substantial then the desire to enable ping/pong could be done as part of the data handed to `.injectWS()`.\n\n## Closing Remarks\n\nJust wanted to say thank you for all the great work on `fustily-websocket`! We rely on it for production uses and have been extremely happy with it \uD83D\uDE04 I'm happy to open a small PR for this if desired. \n\n### Link to code that reproduces the bug\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/code-ape/bc6199713f9fee8415b6998db1b1f9fa\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe client created by `.injectWS()` should have `.on(\"ping\", () => ws.pong())` set by default.",

      "description" : "### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.\n\nCurrently, we allow descriptive stream names such as `NPP, ATMS` following a known convention in the satellite world. See [this example](https://github.com/ecmwf/WeatherGenerator/pull/328/files#diff-f893baba4f83facdfc557997e6bf4b389b927123e41035d4450fbb06e957b5f7). However, logging systems only want simple names for metrics such as `a.b.c`. where `a` is `a-zA-Z0-9-_` . It could be more but I would not push because it would break pandas column selection.\n\nAs a result, we cannot really have per-stream metrics, which would be useful for example to track how many samples are being ingested per stream. In this case it would be `streams.NPP, ATMS.count_samples` which would cause issues with WandB or MLFlow.\n\nI see 3 ways forward:\n\n- magic: conversion of `NPP, ATMS` to camelCase `NppAtms` for example\n- convention: only allow names that follow the convention above and return error instead\n- extra info: when defining a stream name, require a user to set an `stream_id` as a unique machine-ready identifier (for example `NPP_ATMS`)\n\nIn any case, I believe this name should be `a-zA-Z0-9_` (no _ to prevent weird issues with databases or pandas)\n\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/47964380/pandas-dataframe-column-naming-conventions\n\n\n\nDo you have any thoughts on that?\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Organisation\n\n_No response_",

The `cmake` build type can be left as-is.\n\nThere is currently only one \"version\" of the template files used for the `ament_cmake` build type. What we want to do here is to have another version of the template files that uses `ament_cmake_python`, similar to [what's described in the docs](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/How-To-Guides/Ament-CMake-Python-Documentation.html).\n\nIn my comment above (https://github.com/ros2/ros2cli/issues/739#issuecomment-2810590122), I proposed to select the version of the template files using a new `--template-name` option, which could only be used with `--build-type ament_cmake`, since it only applies to the `ament_cmake` build type:\n\n1. `--build-type ament_cmake`: uses the [current template](https://github.com/ros2/ros2cli/blob/rolling/ros2pkg/ros2pkg/resource/ament_cmake/CMakeLists.txt.em)\n2. `--build-type ament_cmake --template-name cmake`: uses the current template too (we assume that `--template-name cmake` is the default with `--build-type ament_cmake`)\n3. `--build-type ament_cmake --template-name python`: uses a new template for `ament_cmake` packages that contain Python code and thus use `ament_cmake_python`, like the one in https://github.com/ros2/ros2cli/pull/904\n\nThe files for the two different versions (1&2 vs 3 above) are _almost_ the same, except for these extra lines in the template files used when we select `--template-name python`:\n\n1.  `CMakeLists.txt`:\n    1. Add `find_package(ament_cmake_python REQUIRED)` at the top, [as shown here](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/How-To-Guides/Ament-CMake-Python-Documentation.html#using-ament-cmake-python)\n    2. Add `ament_python_install_package(${PROJECT_NAME})` before the tests, [as shown here](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/How-To-Guides/Ament-CMake-Python-Documentation.html#using-ament-cmake-python)\n    3. Add some code for Python tests inside `if(BUILD_TESTING) ... endif()`, [as shown here](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/How-To-Guides/Ament-CMake-Python-Documentation.html#using-ament-cmake-pytest)\n1. `package.xml`:\n    1. Add a `buildtool_depend` on `ament_cmake_python`, [as shown here](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/How-To-Guides/Ament-CMake-Python-Documentation.html#using-ament-cmake-python)\n    2.

Since the files are almost the same, you could have one set of template files and only include the `ament_cmake_python` parts I described above using some `@[if ...]@` conditions in the `.em` template file _if_ the user selects ` --template-name python`.\n\nIf you've already made some changes in a branch, you could create a PR and we can discuss there.", "@christophebedard I am almost done with the changes, I just want to know on how to handle node name and library name ?\nDo I take those arguments in consideration and if yes, then which kind should be generated (python or cmake) ?" ],

During the first stage of training, the strong information bottleneck created by the VQ-VAE codebook forces the learned latent actions to capture only the information not inferable from task instructions—resulting in task-irrelevant latent actions.\n\nIn the second stage, with these task-irrelevant latents frozen, the newly initialized latent actions are trained to replace the role of language, allowing them to learn task-centric dynamics.\n\nThis also explains why, in naive latent action learning approaches like LAPA and Genie, latent action tokens mostly encode motion/dynamics—since texture information is already preserved from previous frames for future frame prediction in the decoder. ", "If your goal is to learn task-relevant tokens, why not directly use contrastive learning to encode those tokens and perform a soft alignment with the text instruction features? Have you tried this approach? It seems like a more straightforward way to achieve your objective.\n", "@retsuh-bqw Thanks for your detailed explanation.\n\nTo support your claims, I think it would be helpful to demonstrate what kind of behavior the latent actions actually exhibit.

Operators need a simple way—via environment variables, just like `DB_POOL_SIZE`, `CACHE_TYPE`, etc.—to tune how many times and how often the gateway retries before aborting.\n\n---\n\n### \uD83E\uDDED Type of Feature\n\n- [x] Enhancement to existing functionality\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDE4B‍♂️ User Story 1\n\n**As a:** DevOps engineer running MCP Gateway in Kubernetes  \n**I want:** to set `DB_MAX_RETRIES` and `DB_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS` for any SQLAlchemy-backed database  \n**So that:** the application patiently waits until the database container is ready, instead of crashing and restarting in a loop\n\n#### ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n```gherkin\nScenario: Database retries during startup\nGiven MCP Gateway starts with DB_MAX_RETRIES=10 and DB_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS=5000\nAnd the database is not yet ready\nWhen the first connection attempt fails\nThen the gateway should log \"DB connection failed (attempt 1/10), retrying in 5 s\"\nAnd it should retry every 5 s\nAnd after 10 failed attempts it should exit with a clear error message\n```\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDE4B‍♂️ User Story 2\n\n**As a:** Site Reliability Engineer using Redis caching  \n**I want:** analogous knobs `REDIS_MAX_RETRIES` and `REDIS_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS`  \n**So that:** the gateway’s cache layer behaves consistently with the database layer\n\n#### ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n```gherkin\nScenario: Redis retries respect custom settings\nGiven REDIS_MAX_RETRIES=15 and REDIS_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS=2000\nAnd Redis is unavailable\nWhen the cache subsystem initialises\nThen it must retry up to 15 times at 2 s intervals\nAnd surface a single aggregated error if all attempts fail\n```\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDE4B‍♂️ User Story 3\n\n**As a:** Platform administrator  \n**I want:** sensible defaults (3 retries × 2000 ms) so I don’t have to set anything for typical installs  \n**So that:** small deployments gain resilience out-of-the-box\n\n#### ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n```\n\nScenario: Defaults work when variables are unset\nGiven none of the four *_RETRIES or *_INTERVAL_MS variables are set\nWhen the gateway cannot reach the database\nThen it retries 3 times with 2 s between attempts\n\n```\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDCD0 Design Sketch (optional)\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\nsubgraph Settings\nENV[\".env / ENV vars\"]\nend\nENV --> Config[config.py load Settings]\nConfig -->|DB config| DBClient[SQLAlchemy Engine]\nConfig -->|Cache config| RedisClient[Redis Async Client]\n\nDBClient --> RetryLogic\nRedisClient --> RetryLogic\n\nRetryLogic{{\"Retry up to N timesnsleep(interval_ms)\"}}\nRetryLogic --> Logger\n```\n\n| Component | Change | Detail |\n|----------|--------|--------|\n| `config.py` | Add four `@env_settings` fields | `db_max_retries:int=3`, `db_retry_interval_ms:int=2000`, `redis_max_retries:int=3`, `redis_retry_interval_ms:int=2000` |\n| `db.py` | Wrap DB connect logic in retry loop | Use `asyncio.sleep()` for interval |\n| Redis cache init | Retry connect with same config | Applies if `CACHE_TYPE=redis` |\n| Logging | One log per retry attempt | Include attempt count and retry delay |\n| README | Add env var docs | Match style of existing DB/Redis config\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDD17 MCP Standards Check\n\n- [x] No protocol-level breaking changes\n- [x] Follows existing env var config conventions\n- [ ] Deviations: none\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDD04 Alternatives Considered\n\n| Alternative | Pros | Cons |\n|------------|------|------|\n| `docker-compose` healthcheck + `depends_on` | Simple for local dev | Doesn’t help bare-metal or k8s |\n| Exponential back-off | Faster in some cases | Adds complexity |\n| Gunicorn retry preload script | Works for some runners | Not general-purpose\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDCD3 Additional Context\n\n- Mirrors retry pattern used in `max_tool_retries`\n- Naming aligned with `DB_POOL_SIZE`, `CACHE_TYPE`, etc.\n- Ensure this is then changed in the helm chart.\n\nExample configuration:\n\n```bash\nexport DB_MAX_RETRIES=10\nexport DB_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS=5000\nexport REDIS_MAX_RETRIES=10\nexport REDIS_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS=5000\n```\n",

Create a new documentation page at docs/docs/using/clients/mcp-cli.md that:\n\n   - Introduces mcp-cli as a Python CLI tool for interacting with MCP Gateway.\n   - Explains how to use it with Bearer token authentication, referencing the MCP_AUTH_TOKEN environment variable.\n   - Describes how to use it with mcpgateway-wrapper for local development/testing, including setting MCP_SERVER_CATALOG_URLS and running the wrapper.\n   - Provides example commands and configuration snippets based on the README content and typical usage patterns.\n   - Mentions the stdio transport and its role in enabling clients without SSE support.\n\n2. Update the docs/docs/using/.pages file to add a link to this new mcp-cli documentation page for discoverability.\n\n3. Verify the instructions by testing mcp-cli usage with MCP Gateway and mcpgateway-wrapper locally if feasible.\n\nlet me know your thoughts and I can start working on it. ", "Sounds good, thanks!

      "description" : "This is a feature request to track a potential PR to implement it. I'm also looking for feedback for both naming and implementation preference.\n\nUsers can currently speed up Target Quality by only encoding down to only 1/4 of the frames in a chunk by specifying `--probing-rate 2..4`. We'll call this current behavior the \"rate\" strategy. We find this strategy acceptable because we consider that not all frames in a scene/chunk are necessary to accurately probe it and the speed-accuracy tradeoff is worth it. With that in mind, I propose a different strategy for reducing the computation in Target Quality probing: the \"subset\" strategy. This strategy would probe only the middle N frames in a chunk. Users can specify the number of frames to probe with `--probe-strategy subset --probing-subset N`. So for a given chunk of 400 frames, users can specify `--probing-subset 50` to probe only 50 frames in the middle.\n\nIt's possible to implement both strategies simultaneously but for simplicity we can only support just one strategy at a time. For now, I initially propose 2 new options: `--probe-strategy` (or alternatively `--probe-type`) and `--probing-subset <INT>`. The value for `--probe-stategy` can be `rate` or `subset` and defaults to `rate` to match the current behavior. `--probing-rate <INT>` will be ignored when using `--probe-strategy subset` and vice-versa for `--probing-subset <INT>` and `--probe-strategy rate` (default).\n\nI understand there are valid reasons to avoid using subsets in Target Quality mode, but I have had satisfactory results with this strategy in my own custom reimplementation of Target Quality and would like to see it implemented in the core product as an optional feature. I personally use ~20 frames per chunk so it's significantly faster than 1/4 of a very long chunk.\n\nThanks,\n\\- Boats M.",

Given that, it might be helpful to make this redirection behavior customizable.\n\nSuggestion:\nAdding an optional setting to disable pie menu redirection and instead allow the assigned command to execute would be very useful—especially for users who customize many shortcuts or manage complex menu systems.\n\nThis would remove unnecessary limitations and offer more flexibility in how users design their workflows.\n\n### Affected Desktop Environments\n\nWindows\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_",

When I do this, and I invoke Kando, Kando still remains with the old non-existing icons (probably because it uses a cache):\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dcc1eb3c-0054-4029-b9a0-f3520c3cbe4e)\n\nI also tried to use `kando --reload menu-theme` but it does not refresh the icons.

Forked and cloned the repository, then searched the codebase for `readline` usage to find the core input handling logic.\n2.  Identified `useKeypress.ts` (for raw keypress events) and `InputPrompt.tsx` (for input logic) as the key files.\n3.  To see what the application receives, I temporarily modified the code to log every keypress event to a `debug.log` file.\n4.  **Key Finding:** My initial debugging proved that on a default macOS Terminal, `Shift+Enter` sends the exact same sequence (`\\r`) as a regular `Enter` press, making the two indistinguishable.\n\n### Attempted Fix & The Final Discovery\n\nBased on the initial finding, I attempted a code-only fix by teaching the application to listen for a different key combination, `Shift+Down`, which often sends a unique sequence on other terminals.\n\n1. The Code I Tested\nI modified `useKeypress.ts` to listen for the `Shift+Down` sequence (`\\x1b[1;2B`) and `InputPrompt.tsx` to handle a `key.shift` flag.\n\n```typescript\n// In useKeypress.ts, I added a check:\nif (key.sequence === '\\x1b[1;2B') {\n  key.name = 'return';\n  key.shift = true;\n}\n```\n```typescript\n// In InputPrompt.tsx, I added the key.shift check:\nif (key.ctrl || key.meta || key.shift || charBefore === '\\\\' || key.paste) {\n  // ... newline logic\n}\n```\n\n2. The Result: It Also Failed\nThis proof-of-concept did not work. To understand why, I used the `cat` command to see what my terminal was actually sending when I pressed `Shift+Down`.\nFinal Proof: The terminal sent `^[[B`, which is the standard escape code for a plain Cursor Down key.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis investigation leads to a definitive conclusion: the default macOS Terminal is more limited than anticipated. It appears to strip the `Shift` modifier information from both the `Enter` key and the arrow keys, making a code-only fix for a `Shift+Key` newline combination unfeasible on this specific platform, although i think this might work on other platforms which by default register shift + down as '\\x1b[1;2B' but i cant really test it.\n\nThis might explain why `Ctrl+J` is a common suggested alternative, as it sends a universal newline character (`\\n`) that doesn't rely on modifier key parsing.\n\nAs this is my first contribution, my analysis could be wrong, and I apologize for the detailed-but-failed attempt. Given these findings, what is the desired path forward? Any information from the internal `b.corp.google.com` link about how other terminals are supported would still be very helpful.\n\nThank you for your time and guidance.", "Just to add, I personally use the Warp Terminal on Mac.

If you are planing on helping out will multiple sections, then submit 1 or 2, and I will review them and then you can do more. Because the rst2myst does make mistakes, the reviewer(probably me) needs to click on every link and check carefully line by line.  \n\nJust add a comment to what section you are working on. \n\nAn unfortunate downside is that the git blame will be reset for the docs files. \n\nThe index.rst file needs to be the last file converted since I cannot figure out to have rst files and a md file as the index.

A机房部署thanos，采样之后保存历史数据。\r\n  - B机房部署VictoriaMetrics，提供3个月原始数据。\r\n  - C机房部署Prometheus，量比较小。\r\n\r\n  - 使用了telegraf采集基础监控，业务监控暂时通过falcon的/v1/push接口转发至n9e,后期下掉falcon由sdk直接上报。\r\n  - telegraf加壳部署为n9e-agent,每个机器都往各自机房server写数据。\r\n  - A,B机房的数据双写(集群：Default)，读写地址是通过srv域名做的区域解析。A区的server读自己的TSDB(thanos)，B区的server读(B机房部署VictoriaMetrics，提供3个月原始数据)。\r\n\r\n- TSDB:\r\n  - 时序存储测试了thanos,VictoriaMetrics,m3db。m3db因资源占用太高被下掉了。\r\n  - m3db: m3 Coordinator节点经常oom,扩容到5台*256G的内存都不行，换了vm 5台128G的机器还有50%空闲。\r\n  - thanos: 用的Receive模式，保存3个月原始数据，历史数据会采样之后上传到oss,压力主要在receive服务。\r\n    > thanos有个问题：query无法按时间就近查询receive,而是查询所有store地址然后合并数据(是否我的用法不当)？假如receive存7天数据，store存30天数据，我只想查最近7天的数据，他会同时查询receive和store,因为store数据可能保存在oss所以会很慢。为了解决查询速度慢的问题，加了query-frontend,store地址也合并为1个lb地址，初次查询会慢，后面就走缓存了。\r\n  - VictoriaMetrics：vm我测试下来挺满意的，目前用了8台机器，总体资源使用不足40%。\r\n\r\n- 需求建议：可以更易用，当然这个是大家共同探索的方向。\r\n", "@bbaobelief 请教几个问题\r\n1、业务监控暂时通过falcon的/v1/push接口转发至n9e(将原来agent推送到transfer的压力都转发到n9e,为什么不考虑直接推送到vm或者Prometheus).后期下掉falcon由sdk直接上报(这块agent聚合能力放到sdk去处理吗？还是采取一分钟推送一次？感觉这块逻辑放到sdk是否会影响原来应用的资源使用)\r\n2、之前falcon的nodata处理你们有遇到这块的问题嘛？", "> @bbaobelief 请教几个问题 1、业务监控暂时通过falcon的/v1/push接口转发至n9e(将原来agent推送到transfer的压力都转发到n9e,为什么不考虑直接推送到vm或者Prometheus).后期下掉falcon由sdk直接上报(这块agent聚合能力放到sdk去处理吗？还是采取一分钟推送一次？感觉这块逻辑放到sdk是否会影响原来应用的资源使用) 2、之前falcon的nodata处理你们有遇到这块的问题嘛？\r\n\r\n- 问题 1\r\n  - 写n9e-server是为了配置多个远程写，还有n9e-server有ident注册逻辑，自动按业务组打标签功能。目前观察n9e-server没啥压力。\r\n  - 我们现有的框架sdk是计算好之后1分钟上报一次falcon,为了n9e能快速上线，减少业务代码改动，用了falcon-agent转发n9e-server。\r\n- 问题 2\r\n  - nodata目前没有太好的方案。对于一些精确labels使用了`absent_over_time `函数告警。", "- 企业或者组织: 方正证券\r\n- 地点：北京\r\n- 使用场景和经验分享：\r\n- 最看重夜莺的哪些功能：\r\n\t* 云原生监控，无缝对接Prometheus的能力，支持多种、多个数据源\r\n\t* 开源、活跃的社区、有问必答的专业监控咨询，构建了一个比较好的监控生态圈，能放心使用\r\n\t* 从Open-Falcon到夜莺，监控组件一直很稳定\r\n\t* 更有效的告警策略配置\r\n\t* 完善的监控数据查询、监控大盘构建能力\r\n\t* 按业务线进行读、写权限控制\r\n- 使用规模和范围：\r\n\t* 测试环境监控对象接入1500+,生产环境监控对象接入近6000台\r\n\t* 测试环境监控策略700+项,生产环境监控策略3300+项\r\n- 架构：目前是在同时使用Open-falcon和夜莺监控系统\r\n    * 6机房，保留Open-falcon监控系统：Transfer组件转发到中心Transfer\r\n    * 主机房夜莺server、webapi按官方推荐，根据需求多节点部署\r\n    * agent：历史监控一直使用Open-falcon，涉及agent较多，且falcon-agent的适配和稳定性较好，采用夜莺facon push接口，进行数据同步；K8S使用grafana-agent采集；telegraf根据需求进行部署，进一步推广\r\n    * 监控数据：中心Transfer 同步到夜莺；默认采用Prometheus TSDB，接入多个研发、运维的Prometheus数据源；VictoriaMetrics作为长期存储\r\n- 需求建议：\r\n\t * 管控能力，更少的人管理更多的监控\r\n\t * 更容易上手，降低研发、运维等使用门槛\r\n\t * agent管理：状态、部署、更新、命令下发等能力\r\n\t * 插件或工具的管理及流程化\r\n\r\n最后特别感谢夜莺监控团队对监控领域的辛勤付出和耐心解答！", "> \r\n\r\n企业或者组织: 深圳艾派\r\n地点：西安\r\n使用场景：可视化监控报警配置\r\n需求建议：app或者小程序", "企业或者组织: 人人公司\r\n地点：北京\r\n使用场景：可视化监控报警配置，日志监控，对接K8S ，做多集群prometheus 存储\r\n需求建议：日志mtail 本身是日志告警的，有个组件叫loggie ，做日志告警以及日志收集，看是否可以整合，两个开源团队能否碰触火花", "企业或者组织: 诺瓦星云科技股份有限公司\r\n地点：西安\r\n使用场景：主要是监控VMware云的虚机，做可视化监控报警配置，应用日志监控，多集群prometheus 存储。\r\n需求建议：可一边使用快捷查询，一边可提示语法方式制作、测试监控模板。碰到过好多，告警模板制作好了，许久没有告警。\r\n\r\n最重要的是，作为一个监控系统，虽然不做大而全，但至少能提供一个批量处理集群的命令执行工具。比如ansible能集成就好了。\r\n\r\n祝发展越来越好。", "- 企业或者组织: 路特斯\r\n- 地点：武汉\r\n- 使用场景和经验分享：\r\n- 最看重夜莺的哪些功能：\r\n  -

(need action1 done)\n\nMove the connector creation logic from `Connector` to `ConnectorFactory`.\n\n\nThe benefits:\n- Know the relationship between parameters. Use the `optionRule` check the config before create connector instance.\n- This can be used in SeaTunnelWeb.\n\n\nWelcome to do this with me\n\n### Task list\n\n\n| type       |

accomplish?\n\n- List and describe the connector parameters in the `Factory.optionRule()` method.\nWhile doing so, we can move all parameters into the XXXXOptions class to unify the code style and centralize the parameters into a single file.\n\n- Move the connector creation logic into `Factory.createSource/createSink`.\nImplement the `createSource/createSink` methods in Factory and instantiate the corresponding connector.\n\n\n\n### Are you willing to submit PR?\n\n- [x] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!",

What it would be look like?\n\nAbout proposal2\nnow some connector implement the `TableSourceFactory`, but they not implement `createSource` method. so we still has 2 way to create the `Connector` instance.\n- one is use `tableSourceFactory.createSource/Sink()` it return the connector instance.\n- one is use `ServiceLoader.load` to load all implement and use `pluginIdentifier` to find the connector instance.\n\nSo I suggest we unified the behavior, implement the `createSource/Sink` method. use `Factory` to create the connector instance. \n\n\n```\n    private static boolean isFallback(Optional<Factory> factory) {\n        if (!factory.isPresent()) {\n            return true;\n        }\n        try {\n            ((TableSourceFactory) factory.get()).createSource(null);\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            if (e instanceof UnsupportedOperationException\n                    && \"The Factory has not been implemented and the deprecated Plugin will be used.\"\n                            .equals(e.getMessage())) {\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n```\n", "Oh I got it.

      "description" : "### Description\r\nWe currently include the default layout of [tagify](https://github.com/yairEO/tagify/) by copying the original CSS file from the npm package [in gulp](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-server/blob/1acd2ff884e176aa2434d5527fd05f4eb7ecd717/gulpfile.ts#L136). However, the tagify package also provides a [source SCSS file](https://github.com/yairEO/tagify/blob/v4.22.2/src/tagify.scss). It would be interesting to use the SCSS file instead and adapt the styling to our new website design.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Solution\r\n1. Use tagifies' SCSS file as a modifiable base instead of the pre-built CSS file\r\n1. Update the styling to match our new website design.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n- Consistent styling with our website design.\r\n- Easier maintenance and customization using SCSS.\r\n\r\n### Implementation Steps\r\n1. Create a new SCSS file, which included the tagify SCSS file.\r\n1. Use that SCSS file instead of the CSS file in Gulp, so it's copied to `css/dist/tagify.css` during build\r\n1. Update the styling as needed.\r\n\r\n### Additional Notes\r\n- Ensure compatibility with other components and styles in our project.",

It draws a straight line between the cursor position last time the lasso was removed and when it's now restored, allowing the user to also use this as a technique for drawing straight line sections of the lasso, but also just to decide to use box selection instead of lasso at any time.\n- Ctrl+dragging an *object* currently drags its layer(s) but we want to make it instead always lasso select. This lets the user perform a lasso selection over an existing layer, or a box selection but releasing Ctrl as in the previous bullet point.\n- Lasso selection has a bug that should be fixed: aborting the lasso selection (RMB or Esc) then creating a new lasso selection ends up erroneously extending the previously drawn lasso path because abort fails to clear the lasso data (which also wastes memory!).

Here’s my high-level plan:\n\n1. **Interface scaffolding**  \n   - Pull the exact `NFTContractInterface`, `JobContractInterface`, etc. from Issues #440 & #441.  \n   - Generate TS stubs for each contract method & event signature.\n\n2. **Mock implementations**  \n   - For each contract interface, create a `MockXyzContract` class that simulates state in-memory (e.g. `Map<…>`).  \n   - Implement all methods with realistic return types, incrementing IDs or toggling states as needed.  \n   - Include optional IPFS-style metadata where applicable.\n\n3. **Configurable delays & errors**  \n   - Add a shared `MockConfig` where teams can set per-contract or per-method delays (in ms) and error rates.  \n   - Wrap methods in a helper that injects `await sleep(config.delay)` and randomly throws when `config.errorRate > 0`.\n\n4. **Dockerized local server**  \n   - Spin up an Express (or Fastify) HTTP+JSON-RPC server exposing each mock contract under distinct endpoints (e.g. `/mock/nft/mint`).  \n   - Write a `Dockerfile` that installs dependencies, builds TS, and starts the mock server.  \n   - Expose ports & volume-mount docs for easy local use.\n\n5. **Documentation & examples**  \n   - Add a `README.md` with:\n     - Installation via `docker build` + `docker run`\n     - Environment variables or JSON config format\n     - Sample TS code showing how to `import { MockNFTContract }` or call the Docker-based RPC.  \n   - Provide a small `example/` folder with a Next.js or Node script that mints a token, polls for events, and demonstrates error injection.\n\n6. **Testing**  \n   - Write unit tests (Jest) to assert that each mock follows its interface and respects delays/errors.  \n   - Add a CI step in `mock/` that runs these tests.\n\nI’ll follow the project’s CONTRIBUTING guidelines, commit under a branch named `mock-contracts-setup`, and open a draft PR once I’ve scaffolded the first two mocks. Please assign this issue to me or let me know if there’s any other setup I should follow first.

Would it be helpful for me to reproduce the panic using the provided YAML and test @orfeas-k’s potential fix, focusing on validating the new error message?\n2. Should I propose a test case in the KServe test suite (e.g., under test/) to ensure the controller rejects invalid configurations with a clear, actionable error?\n3. Are there preferred validation patterns or error message formats for the fix in hpa_reconciler.go?\n4. How can I best coordinate with @orfeas-k to assist with implementation or testing without overlapping efforts?\n\nI’ve set up a KServe development environment with Kubernetes and am prepared to reproduce the issue, test proposed fixes, or contribute validation logic. Any guidance on next steps or specific areas where I can add value would be appreciated. Thank you for supporting contributions to KServe!" ],

We can see [here](https://github.com/fjall-rs/lsm-tree/blob/main/src/blob_tree/mod.rs#L562) that the `BlobTree::disk_usage()` considers both the size of the index (keys) & blobs (values).\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n1. In the [rolling-log](https://github.com/fjall-rs/fjall/blob/main/examples/rolling-log/src/main.rs) example, enable kv separation & change inserted value to `[0; 1024]`\n2. Run the example & watch it crash on the assert after 5 steps.\n\n**Expected behavior**\nThe partition should be compacted as per the docs.\n\n**Additional context**\nI'm using fjall, not this crate directly. But since `Fifo` is defined in this crate, I'm opening this issue here.\n",

DO NOT post duplicates.\r\n- Finally, put x into all relevant boxes (like this [x])\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] I'm reporting a site feature request\r\n- [x] I've verified that I'm running youtube-dl version **2021.12.17**\r\n- [x] I've searched the bugtracker for similar site feature requests including closed ones\r\n\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nProvide an explanation of your site feature request in an arbitrary form. Please make sure the description is worded well enough to be understood, see https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl#is-the-description-of-the-issue-itself-sufficient. Provide any additional information, suggested solution and as much context and examples as possible.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWith the latest google search versions, one can look up \"NFL\" (for example), and the schedules, players and teams pop-up as well as (and this is what I'm suggesting to implement) previews or highlights. When trying to download them from the Google page, it does not recognizes it, the user needs to get into the actual video (youtube in most cases) to get it. Implementing this would mean much faster access to videos and the users not having to navigate several layers of webpages to download them.\r\nI tried creating a general \"google extractor\" but couldn't manage to do it. Other option I thought about but could not put into practice was to handle that webpage forwarding (google search -> youtube) within the program\r\n",

Check out yt-dl and yt-dlp, load the yt-dlp extractor into the editor and load the yt-dl extractor into the right-hand pane. Then you can go through the differences and decide whether the yt-dlp change should applied directly, modified or ignored. Some changes will be specific to yt-dlp and need to be adapted so as to run on both Python 2 and 3. For example, the linked commit includes these lines that will fail in Python 2 \r\n```\r\n                'http://www.google.com/search', f'gvsearch:{query}',\r\n                note=f'Downloading result page {pagenum + 1}',\r\n```\r\nYou'll need to change this in some way, say:\r\n```\r\n                'http://www.google.com/search', 'gvsearch:' + query,\r\n                note='Downloading result page %d' % (pagenum + 1, ),\r\n```\r\n\r\nSome IDE plug-in or judicious use of _vi_ and _diff_ could achieve the same result.\r\n\r\nIf there is a specific change, a commit or set of commits, that should be applied, you can use _git_ magic to apply such commits while preserving the commit details. In GH you can add `.patch` to commit and PR URLs to generate a patch file that you can pass to the `git am` command: to make the patch applicable you first have to edit it to replace the `yt_dlp/` in pathnames with `youtube_dl/`. After applying the patch to your branch you can make any additional changes in your own subsequent commit. Eventually when this gets merged we would probably `squash` the commits in the PR so that the resulting commit appears as `Co-authored by:` all the people whose commits are included.\r\n\r\nAs above, test the modified extractor in your patch branch (there's a small test in the linked commit). Then push the branch to your yt-dl fork. You should be able to enable the server-side tests that ensure your changes work in a variety of supported environments.

However, the `ccusage blocks --live` monitor in the terminal shows the session ending at a different time (8 PM in the attached screenshot).\n\nThis difference can be a bit confusing as it's not clear which timer to follow. Could you please clarify if this is the expected behavior?\n\n#### **Steps to Observe the Behavior**\n1. On macOS with the latest version of VS Code.\n2. Have the Claude Code extension installed.\n3. In the VS Code integrated terminal, run the command `ccusage@latest blocks --live`.\n4. The time displayed by the extension in the editor's top bar (\"resets at 6pm\") differs from the \"Remaining\" time in the `ccusage` monitor (e.g., shows end time of 8:00:00 PM).\n\n#### **My Expectation**\nFor clarity, I would expect both timers to be synchronized and reflect the actual session end time.\n\n#### **Screenshots**\nAs shown in the screenshot, the top right of the IDE indicates a reset time of 6 PM, while the `ccusage` session monitor in the terminal shows a session end time of 8 PM.\n\n#### **Environment**\n* **OS:** macOS\n* **IDE:** Visual Studio Code (Latest Version)\n* **Tool:** `ccusage@latest`\n* **Extension Name & Version:** Claude Code `[Please add extension version if known]`\n\nThank you for looking into this.　",

Key considerations include:\r\n- Allowing the user to cancel the pop-up screen so they do not get the notification again (at least on the current installation!)\r\n- Pop-up appearing after approx 5-7 sessions\r\n- Making it easy to provide feedback, e.g. a rating scale for a particular feature, with supporting text field for additional details",

Hope that helps clarify...", "I'm going to start working on this issue!", "I started working on this issue by creating a new Helper file similar to AppShareHelper and AppReviewHelper which handle the pop-ups for sharing or reviewing the app. I was wondering what would be the best way to store user responses? Is there some sort of API to use to receive the responses? Or should I use GDATelemetry? I noticed it says it's a stub, but still seems to be used.", "There's not currently any mechanism for receiving  user data. The `GDATelemetry` subsystem was not included in the open-source release provided by Microsoft, and we never hooked up a replacement, so all the references you see to it in the code are no-ops. Getting a working telemetry system would be a nice project on its own, though at the same time I'm quite happy not having us handling any user-provided data and the security/privacy implications that come with that.\n\nAs for the feature at issue here, the current feedback link just opens a new email message in the user's email program. Keeping this as the mechanism could be fine for a first pass while we're focusing on improving the UX of when/how the prompt gets shown." ],

Write a brief description of how you will approach the task (without using ChatGPT).\n3. Add your Telegram handler in your application (e.g., in OnlyDust or similar)\n4. Write ETA in your application\n\n\n\n## What should I do if I have a problem\n1. Try to google it before asking. Googling is taking major part of dev work \n2. If you couldn't find answer your question with Google, text your question to [dev](https://t.me/spotnet_dev/4) group with your question.\n3. Do not send DM to maintainer, it would be better and faster to ask other contributors in chat \n\n\n## How to prepare PR\n1. Check if your code [smell](https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/smells) good\n2.  Add `close #<issue number>` to link your issue with your PR\n3.  Do not commit changes which is not related to your task \n4. Check after you created PR, if you committed everything.\n\n## Task Description\n1. Create a new `docker-compose.margin.yml` file in the [`devops`](https://github.com/djeck1432/spotnet/blob/main/devops) directory by duplicating the contents of the existing [`docker-compose.margin.back.yml`](https://github.com/djeck1432/spotnet/blob/main/devops/docker-compose.margin.back.yml).\n2. In [`docker-compose.margin.back.yml`](https://github.com/djeck1432/spotnet/blob/main/devops/docker-compose.margin.back.yml), remove the `frontend` service.",

But OK. I am one the road. Short answer: seems right. Please keep the relative path; but the file has to be copied (because the starting point changes). Read on at https://devdocs.jabref.org/code-howtos/#get-a-relative-filename-or-path-for-a-file and think of different cases. Maybe the file is reachable from the other bib file without copying; then just the path needs to be adapted.", "Sorry for asking again, I just want to make sure I fully understand the intended behavior.\n\nLet’s say I have the following structure:\n\n<img width=\"227\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a852d334-b47e-4bc0-b402-7cd48e07b330\" />\n\nWhen I copy an entry from personal.bib to parent.bib, then the file is not reachable and needs to be copied, that part is clear.\n\nBut if I copy an entry from personal.bib to paper.bib, and paper.bib has @ Comment{jabref-meta: fileDirectory:paperfiles;}, the file is still reachable without copying.\n\nHowever, the current implementation keeps the file field as:\n\nfile = {:personalfiles/something.txt:TXT}\n\nAnd you would like that to be changed to a relative path like:\n\nfile = {:../personalfiles/something.txt:TXT}\n\nSo that it works correctly from the perspective of paper.bib with its fileDirectory set to paperfiles/?\n\nThanks again for your guidance and for your time!" ],

Then the field will be in the `maindata` request, expand the torrent hash causing the bug and send the \"completion_on\" field", "I just tested with qBittorrent v4.6.3. It seems like the `completion_on` field is returning the date-time `1970-01-01 00:00:00` of your system timezone as seconds since Unix epoch. So if your timezone is UTC-8, `completion_on` would be 28800, 0 for UTC+0, and -3600 for UTC+1.", "But the UI should display the not complete message for all \"invalid\" dates, that is 0 or negative values. The issue shouldn't happen the way you describe it.\n\nWhat do you receive exactly as the value when it displays the 1970 date? Is it 28800 ?\n\nI thought it was a fixed value but if you say that it depends on your time zone, I would suggest setting up your qBittorrent instance to the correct timezone.", "I was testing different timezones by changing my system timezone using `timedatectl`. The UI displays `1970-01-01 00:00:00` for incomplete torrents when your timezone is west of UTC (e.g. UTC-8). I'm getting a `completed_on` value of 28800 for UTC-8. The UI correctly displays \"Never seen complete\" when the timezone is UTC+, for which `completed_on` has a 0 or negative value.\n\nA possible hack is to change the condition for displaying the date-time from `val > 0` to `val > 43200` (`12 * 60 * 60`) to account for all timezones up to UTC-12", "Maybe I'm not looking in the right place, but this is a `/properties` request for an in-progress torrent:\nThe only seemingly relevant field is the `completion_date` (3rd from the top) which is set to `-1`.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f842f0c9-3f31-412e-8d2b-90008e1982e4)", "Depending on where you look, this is the same field but with different names.\n\n---\n\nqBit v5+:\n\nIn `serialize_torrent.cpp` (maindata):\n```cpp\n{KEY_TORRENT_COMPLETION_ON, Utils::DateTime::toSecsSinceEpoch(torrent.completedTime())},\n```\n\nIn `torrentscontroller.cpp` (properties):\n```cpp\n{KEY_PROP_COMPLETION_DATE, Utils::DateTime::toSecsSinceEpoch(torrent->completedTime())},\n```\n\nConverter function:\n```cpp\nqint64 Utils::DateTime::toSecsSinceEpoch(const QDateTime &dateTime)\n{\n    return dateTime.isValid() ? dateTime.toSecsSinceEpoch() : -1;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\nqBit v4.6.7:\n\nIn `serialize_torrent.cpp` (maindata):\n```cpp\n{KEY_TORRENT_COMPLETION_ON, toTimeStamp(torrent.completedTime())},\n```\n\nIn `torrentscontroller.cpp` (properties):\n```cpp\n{KEY_PROP_COMPLETION_DATE, toTimeStamp(torrent->completedTime())},\n```\n\nConverter function:\n```cpp\nconst auto toTimeStamp = [](const QDateTime &dateTime) -> qint64\n{\n    return dateTime.isValid() ? dateTime.toSecsSinceEpoch() : -1;\n};\n```\n\n---\n\nGiven that all of these leads to the same code, it shouldn't differ in behaviour. If we take a look at how torrents data is updated, we can see that the code is also identical.\n\nFor qBit 5+:\n```cpp\nif (m_nativeStatus.completed_time != oldStatus.completed_time)\n  m_completedTime = (m_nativeStatus.completed_time > 0) ? QDateTime::fromSecsSinceEpoch(m_nativeStatus.completed_time) : QDateTime();\n```\n\nFor qBit 4.6.7:\n```cpp\nQDateTime TorrentImpl::completedTime() const\n{\n  if (m_nativeStatus.completed_time > 0)\n      return QDateTime::fromSecsSinceEpoch(m_nativeStatus.completed_time);\n  else\n      return {};\n}\n```\n\nFrom [Qt docs](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qdatetime.html#fromSecsSinceEpoch-1:~:text=year%201970%2C%20described%20as%20specified%20by%20timeZone.-,The%20default%20time%20representation%20is%20local%20time.,-Note%20that%20there%20are%20possible%20values%20for%20secs), the default is to use the local timezone for the `fromSecsSinceEpoch` method, which confirms the bug.\n\nI think in the end that the behaviour did not change.\n\n@cheneyni-451 if you installed qBittorrent using docker or any other virtualization technology, changing your system timezone will not change anything. Each virtualization uses differnet method for this.

Left-click behavior is just fine; right-click behavior should be equivalent to select + immediate right click action, i.e. open the menu with a target of all currently selected torrents.\r\n\r\nSo for example, if I want to perform a right-click action on three torrents A, B and C:\r\n\r\n1. Left-click on torrent A -> select torrent A.\r\n2. Left-click on torrent B -> select torrent B (in addition to A).\r\n3. Currently: left-click on torrent C to select torrent C (in addition to A and B), then right-click any torrent (Note: even a non-selected torrent, which shouldn't happen IMHO) to open the right-click menu with torrents A, B and C as its actionable targets.\r\n4. Proposed: right-click on torrent C to select torrent C (in addition to A and B) and immediately open the right-click menu with torrents A, B and C as its actionable targets. This also fixes the Note above, because right-clicking on a torrent will now properly add it to the selection\r\n\r\nPlus all the Ctrl/Shift functionality outlined above.\r\n\r\n**EDIT:** I realize this is slightly different than what I proposed initially, but after thinking about it, deselecting the previously selected torrents when right-clicking a new torrent isn't really intuitive.\r\n\r\nIn the same way that left-clicking a torrent will add it to the group of previously selected torrents (if any), right-clicking it should do the same and only additionally open the right-click menu." ],

This is impractical and causes several issues:\n- Multiple instances may concurrently update application files, potentially leading to inconsistent state.\n- On Windows, each instance creates its own tray icon, cluttering the system tray.\n- On macOS, after a shutdown or reboot, the system restores previously active applications. If autostart is enabled in Zen's settings, this may result in multiple instances launching at startup, creating a poor user experience.\n\n### Desired State\nThe application should use Wails’ [Single Instance Lock](https://wails.io/docs/guides/single-instance-lock/) to ensure only one instance is active at a time.\n\n### Notes\n- `OnSecondInstanceLaunch` should inspect the arguments passed to the new instance (`secondInstanceData.Args`). If `--start` is present, the existing instance should call `app.StartProxy`.\n",

Users must open the menu each time, which disrupts workflow.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nAdd a keyboard shortcut **Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + R** to trigger the existing reset flow.\n\n## Current State\n\n| ✅ Already Exists | Location |\n|------------------|----------|\n| Reset-conversation API endpoint | `/api/sessions/${sessionId}/reset` |\n| `handleResetConversation` function | `src/app/webui/components/ChatApp.tsx` (around line 157) |\n| Reset confirmation dialog UI | Same file |\n| Keyboard-shortcut infrastructure | `ChatApp.tsx` (lines 240-281) |\n| Other shortcuts (e.g., Ctrl+J, Ctrl+K, Ctrl+L) | `ChatApp.tsx` |\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n1. **Add Keyboard Shortcut Handler**  \n   File: `src/app/webui/components/ChatApp.tsx`  \n   Inside the existing `useEffect` that listens for keydown events (≈ line 240):\n\n   ```tsx\n   // Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + R  →  Reset conversation\n   if ((e.ctrlKey || e.metaKey) && e.shiftKey && e.key === 'R') {\n     e.preventDefault();\n     if (currentSessionId && !isWelcomeState) {\n       setResetDialogOpen(true);\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Update Shortcuts Modal**  \n   Still in `ChatApp.tsx` (≈ line 652), extend the shortcuts array:\n\n   ```tsx\n   { key: '⌘⇧R', desc: 'Reset conversation' }, // new shortcut\n   ```\n\n3. **(Optional) Update Welcome Screen Hint**  \n   In the quick-tips section (≈ line 437), mention the new shortcut.\n\n## Testing Steps\n\nrefer src/app/webui/README.md for steps to set up the webUI locally for testing\n",

I picked it because the `watch` command calls it `-n` or `--interval`, and I'm used to it. I don't care much what it's called. Random alternatives that come to mind: perhaps `--interval` is good. `-s` (for \"seconds\") might work. `-i` seems a bit sketchy; it works, but would be more intuitive for something like \"interactive\".",

With that observation, I think it makes sense to add command line arguments to set the limit and auto refresh interval. I will have a look at this.\n\nI would like to stick to the defaults of `jj`, so `-n` should set the `--limit` and we can think of something for auto refresh interval.", "This can be implemented in a similar fashion how `-r` was implemented." ],

[Make sure you are eligible for payouts](https://algora.io/docs/payments#supported-countries-regions)\n\n#### ❗ Important guidelines:\n- Do NOT start multiple bounties\n- To claim a bounty, you need to **provide a short demo video** of your changes in your pull request\n- If anything is unclear, **ask for clarification** before starting as this will help avoid potential rework\n- Low quality AI PRs will not receive review and will be closed\n- Please ask to be assigned before attempting to work on the bounty\n\nThank you for contributing to Comet!\n\n| Attempt | Started (UTC) | Solution | Actions |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \uD83D\uDFE2 @mukulpythondev | Jun 22, 2025, 03:18:56 AM | WIP |  |\n| \uD83D\uDFE2 @yashkumar2603 | Jun 29, 2025, 08:04:23 AM | #2624 | [Reward](https://algora.io/claims/3whEj7Twi7LygaPt) |", "/attempt #2520", "/attempt #2520\n\nMy implementation plan is :\n- Create a similar folder structure as hallucination metric in `sdks/python/src/opik/evaluation/metrics/llm_judges/` named `/syc_eval`.\n- Follow similar code structuring as hallucination metric and create files in which the rebuttal mechanism will be written.\n- The key innovation in the paper is to categorize the sycophancy into Progressive and Regressive sycophancy.\n- Four rebuttal strength levels will be configured : simple, ethos, justification, citation.\n- the evaluation will be a 2-step process with initial response evaluation and then rebuttal response evaluation.\n- then we calculate overall sycophancy rates, progressive rates, and regressive rates. Creating detailed breakdown by rebuttal type and context mode.\n\nThen the FE integration will be proceeded with :\n- configure the UI components for configuring SycEval parameters on FE. Including toggles/selection for different rebuttal types and strengths\n- Add context mode selection (radio buttons or dropdown)\n\nLet me know thoughts and inputs on this, I am starting to work on it, I already did setup the codebase locally.

This is because we did not migrate the many convenient, abstracted, and commonly used access control test methods from `ui/webapi/BaseActionTest.java` to `sqlui/webapi/BaseActionTest.java`.\n\nAfter merging #13254, all of the access control test methods in `BaseActionTest.java` have been migrated. Hence, this issue aims to refactor the unit test access controls to use these convenient test methods.\n\n## Progress\nThe progress for this refactoring can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IcB-viJMrIOknYoBYasBuRBK9qnwY0-doEK4_Eb24IA/edit?gid=0#gid=0).\n\n## Steps to Contribute\n\n1. Choose test(s) to work on in the above Google Sheets link, and comment on this issue to indicate that you'd like to contribute on the chosen test(s).\n2. Create a PR to refactor the unit test(s).\n3. Submit the PR, with a link to this issue by starting the description with \"Part of #13304\"\n\n## Tips\n\n- Understand the access control test methods in `sqlui/webapi/BaseActionTest.java`, follow the refactoring in #13254\n- Most of the access control testing logic in the migrated unit tests under `sqlui/webapi` follows the old unit tests under `ui/webapi`, so you may wish to reference the old unit test for help",

Specifically the two I added:\n- `GetStructField`: DataFusion has a similar `get_field` already we could use, but it operates by field name instead of index, so it has to find the right field by name for each batch which adds some overhead, which is some of the downside it seems to the UDFs over logical and physical expressions which can optimize these cases at analysis time. Implementing a custom ScalarUDF also doesn't really make sense because as a user you would never select a nested field by index, always by name.\n- `GetArrayStructFields`: There's no equivalent DataFusion expression AFAIK, but the same thing above applies where there's not really a use cases for using this function directly, Spark just creates this at analysis time from an `ExtractValue` operation" ],

This happens because Superset uses the `dom-to-image-more` library, which captures only what's currently rendered in the DOM—so if the chart/table is scrollable, only the visible section is included in the image export. There is no code in the current implementation to expand the table or render all rows before capturing the image, and no workarounds or enhancements for this have been documented or proposed in recent issues or pull requests [[source]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/e0e3f9494972e90b3eec7a23d75747e0e63c07c9/superset-frontend/src/utils/downloadAsImage.ts).\n\nThis limitation is specific to table and handlebar charts. Other chart types (like bar, line, or pie charts) that use ECharts can export the full chart regardless of what is visible, because ECharts provides its own export API that isn't limited by the DOM viewport.\n\nCurrently, the only alternatives are to export the data as CSV or use a browser extension to capture the full scrollable area, but these are not integrated solutions. If you need the full table as an image, you would need a feature enhancement that temporarily expands the table before capture or stitches together multiple images.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

The ECharts export API only works for ECharts-based charts like bar, line, or pie charts.\n\nFor table/handlebar charts, Superset uses dom-to-image-more, which captures only what's currently rendered in the DOM. Since the DataTable component paginates and virtualizes rows, only the visible portion is exported as an image—there's no built-in logic to expand or render all rows before export. To capture the full table, you'd need to programmatically disable pagination and virtualization (e.g., set page size to all rows), wait for the DOM to update, trigger the image export, and then restore the original state. This approach can cause major performance issues for large tables and isn't currently implemented in Superset. See the relevant code for DataTable and downloadAsImage for more details:  \n[downloadAsImage.ts](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/2e9939baf253e607a54722b1996baaf625e72133/superset-frontend/src/utils/downloadAsImage.ts)  \n[DataTable.tsx](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/2e9939baf253e607a54722b1996baaf625e72133/superset-frontend/plugins/plugin-chart-table/src/DataTable/DataTable.tsx)\n\nAny solution will need to balance user experience and performance, especially for large datasets. There are no alternative export methods or workarounds documented in the repo.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

      "title" : "[DOC]: Illegal use of dynamic Tailwind utility classes in docs",
      "url" : "https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma/issues/4129",
      "repositoryName" : "chroma-core/chroma",
      "description" : "## Description\n\nThe docs use Tailwind [utility classes](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/styling-with-utility-classes) for styling a lot (\"h-5\" (height), \"pr-1\" (padding-right), etc.), which is really convenient and nice. The problem is, because Tailwind produces optimized production code by only bundling the classes that are consumed in the components, which it determines based on static analysis, writing class-names that are composed from run-time variables, like React component props, is prone to failure. For instance, `bg-${props.item.color}` may not work, because Tailwind will not know what `bg-<color>` classes it needs to ship with the code, and so it turns out the class `.bg-pink` has no styles declared. Sometimes you can get away with it, because somewhere *else* in the codebase, `bg-pink` is used explicitly, and therefore gets bundled with the code, and so if your component gets `.bg-pink` at runtime, it will luckily find the classname and get the correct style.\n\nFor the most part, this is probably a pretty insignificant anti-pattern, but the reason I'm bringing it up is because of the Table of Contents in the Docs - I noticed that they don't do recursive indentation of sub-classes/methods/etc. For instance:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/985aee08-ac42-4ba3-886b-d4e944c3214b)\n\nThe headers on the page are H1, H2, H2, and then H3, H3, H3. But as you can see, the H3's (Pull Requests, CIPs, and Discord) are de-indented, whereas a natural assumption would be that each sub-header gets indented more. Indeed, that appears to be the intention of the code, because the classes for the corresponding names in the ToC include `.pl-1`, (padding-left-1), `.pl-2`, and `.pl-3`.\n\nThe problem is these padding utility classes are defined with template strings based off props, where each item is dynamically assigned a \"level\" property through some code, and then the class is something like `pl-${level}`. Because, coincidentally, `.pl-1` and `.pl-2` are used elsewhere in the codebase in a static fashion, their styles are included in the production bundle - but `.pl-3` isn't. So it does nothing. This is why the `###` H3's have no padding/indentation.\n\nFor reference: \n* https://tailwindcss.com/docs/detecting-classes-in-source-files#dynamic-class-names\n* https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma/blob/6586c1c28920210731c51801178482aa6c72a7d8/docs/docs.trychroma.com/components/table-of-contents.tsx#L22\n\n> toc.map((item) => (\n            <div key={item.id} className={`mt-1 **pl-${item.level * 1}**`}>\n\n## Solution\n\nThere's probably some clever solutions to achieve dynamic utility classes, and there are a few other places in the code where this anti-pattern appears, but a really simple way to fix this is just to add `.pl-1/2/3/4/5` to the `globals.css` in order to fix the ToC and call it a day. The only question is whether the maintainers actually would like to see progressive indentation for the Table of Contents. If so, I'd be happy to put together a PR that fixes this issue, so that, e.g. the last three items on the ToC in the screenshot above are actually indented further, and the hierarchical structure of the page is reflected in the ToC. Since the upper bound on heading levels is pretty small, we can just ship them all and it's almost no cost.\n\nAlthough it's clearly been written in such a way that it's _supposed_ to have recursive indentation, I'd just like an OK from a maintainer that this would be a minor cosmetic improvement, and I'll go ahead and submit a fix.\n\nEither way, we should stop writing dynamic utility classes, because it's not supported by Tailwind.\n\n",

Is it possible that its calling sequence has changed in a new version of an external package? Manjaro (Arch) gets bleeding edge updates.\r\n\r\n- While we are investigating this..., is it possible to use the Qt version instead?\r\n\r\n   On Arch, the two versions of AutoKey (GTK and Qt) are packaged separately, so this may require some extra effort to test. If you have any scripts and phrases already defined, be sure to make a backup of $HOME/.config/autokey (including hidden files) before doing any package management.", "I had this happening to me with `/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/autokey/gtkui/dialogs.py`\n\nThis is what I did to fix it \nReplace `text = model.get_value(i.next().iter, 0)` with `text = model.get_value(next(i).iter, 0)` \n\n`i.next()` is Python 2 syntax.  \n\n\n", "Excellent find! It's added to the list of things to do once we can edit the code again.", "@Elliria Is that a personal list or is in here somewhere like in a discussion thread?", "It's a list in my personal wiki that has fifty-some-odd things in it so far that are either partially done or need to be done.\n", "Might be nice to put some of that where others can find it if you're not around.", "I did, once upon a time. A long while back, I created a GitHub repository for tracking tasks and populated it with an issue for each of my tasks.\n\nThat was problematic because when I linked to [AutoKey issues](https://github.com/autokey/autokey/issues) or [AutoKey discussions](https://github.com/autokey/autokey/discussions) in my tasks (which was necessary for completing them), GitHub recognized that I had done that and automatically included a back-link to my issues in the comments of their related AutoKey issues or AutoKey discussions.\n\nThis caused confusion in the AutoKey repository, so I was asked to find a different way to track my tasks. As a result, I moved them into my personal wiki, which is where they've lived ever since.\n\nI haven't invented any tasks that don't already exist somewhere as AutoKey issues, as AutoKey discussions, as suggestions posted by users in comments under either of those, or as sample code posted by users in comments under either of those. This is just my personal collection derived from all of those sources.\n" ],
