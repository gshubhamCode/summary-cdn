We cannot yet delete these components until 2026.\n\n### Proposal\n\nModify Kafka storage and ingester code to use Kafka exporter/receiver from OTEL Contrib. We're already using those in Jaeger v2, and in Jaeger v1 there are precedents on using OTEL components (e.g. OTLP receiver, Zipkin receiver, etc.)\n\nThe existing Kafka integration tests will be useful to validate the functionality.",

I'll be taking this up and create a plan to fix the existing documentation and improve developer onboarding.", "We can follow the plan as mentioned below to streamline the documentation update process.\nThe whole update will be done in various small PRs to catch errors and complete reviews in an efficient manner.\n\n### Removing existing documentation\n\nI think just removing the existing documentation would give us a clean slate to work with. This would ensure we don't have to manage or refactor any outdated docs.\n\n- [x] Cleanup main README.md and remove any source code from it. It should only contain brief description about the project and relevant GitHub related documents.\n- [x] Cleanup existing [docs/source](https://github.com/mobilityhouse/ocpp/tree/master/docs/source) directory and remove outdated docs. Follow the latest guide from [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/#) and start from scratch.\n- [ ] Remove outdated examples from [examples](https://github.com/mobilityhouse/ocpp/tree/master/examples) directory\n\n### Installation, basic examples and usage ??? \n\nUsing the sphinx documentation builder, we can initiate the docs with installation and basic usage.\nWe should start with basic examples of CS and CSMS for both OCPP1.6 and OCPP2.0.1 versions with ~~[websockets@14](https://pypi.org/project/websockets/14.2/) and~~ [websockets@15](https://pypi.org/project/websockets/15.0.1/).\n\n### Deep dive\n\nHere we will outline the inner workings of the package.\nWe can build documentation to answer the following questions:\n- How does routing work?\n- What is call and call_result?\n- The `@on` and `@after` handler.\n- How should I create my `@on` and `@after` Action handlers? What signature should I follow for the function?\n- What are different dataclasses, enums and types involved?\n- What does the exceptions mean and when can I expect them in the codebase?\n- Various helper functions present in the package.\n\n\n### How Tos\n\nThis section will help developers start building real projects.\n\n- How to deploy a CSMS and interact with the chargers through the CSMS?\n- How to use HTTP calls to interact with CSMS to send data to chargers?\n- How to use a queueing technology like RabbitMQ or Redis to communicate with CSMS and send data to chargers?\n- How to use Django/Flask/Asyncio/FastAPI etc. as my framework?\n\n### FAQs\n\nThis section can be built incrementally based on past issues, questions and suggestion from GitHub.", "@a-alak @mdwcrft @proelke\nLet me know your thoughts here.", "Thanks for elaborating on your plan for the docs! \nI think it sounds like a really good structure.\n\nWhile I definitely think it is a good idea to completely start over with the docs, I think PR #712 would be a good bridging until we can publish the new docs. #712 updates the example to compatible with ocpp v2 and websockets v15. Since the updates to both libraries there has been multiple issues from people following the docs and getting errors. Could we publish the updated version in #712, and then start deleting the old docs in the repo? Mostly to avoid all the issues that would be created otherwise.\n\nSecondly do we really need to document websockets v13 and v14? I would imagine that people reading the docs for the first time would probably be able to install latest websockets version. And if you need to work with v13 or v14 I think one should refer to the websockets docs. We can add a note about that maybe. What do you think?\n\nAlso what do you think of the tutorials in #720 as the basic examples and usage section? Or would that be more of the deep dive? Maybe something in between \uD83D\uDE05", "Thanks for the suggestions. Although merging PR #712 would be good, I believe it will anyhow be overwritten soon by new docs.\n\nRegarding websockets compatibility, I think we should atleast support v14 if not v13 in the docs, since most of the projects are still using v14.\n\nA basic tutorial of CSMS and CS will be part of usage itself.", "This issue is stale because it has been open for 30 days with no activity.", "I have started the work on docs revamp.\nI'll create a number of PRs lined up one after the another for quick review and merge them once they are aligned with the above plan.", "Hello, I am new to this project and trying to figure out things.

      "comments" : [ "# :wave: Important: PLEASE READ :wave:\n\nThis issue has been labeled as a **good first issue** and is available for anyone to work on.\n\nIf this is your first time contributing to an open source project, some aspects of the development process may seem unusual, arcane, or some combination of both.\n\n1.  **You cannot \"claim\" issues.** People new to open source often want to \"claim\" or be assigned an issue before beginning work. The typical rationale is that people want to avoid wasted work in the event that someone else ends up working the issue. However, this practice is not effective in open source, as it often leads to \"issue squatting\", in which an individual asks to be assigned, is granted their request, and then never ends up working on the issue. Accordingly, you are encouraged to communicate your intent to address this issue, ideally by providing a rough outline as to how you plan to address the issue or asking clarifying questions, but, at the end of the day, we will take running code and rough consensus in order to move forward quickly.\n2.  **We have a very high bar for contributions.** We have very high standards for contributions and expect all contributions???whether new features, tests, or documentation???to be rigorous, thorough, and complete. Once a pull request is merged into stdlib, that contribution immediately becomes the collective responsibility of all maintainers of stdlib. When we merge code into stdlib, we are saying that we, the maintainers, commit to reviewing subsequent changes and making bugfixes to the code. Hence, in order to ensure future maintainability, this naturally leads to a higher standard of contribution.\n\nBefore working on this issue and opening a pull request, please read the project's [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md). These guidelines and the associated [development guide](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/docs/contributing/development.md) provide important information, including links to stdlib's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), license policy, and steps for setting up your local development environment.\n\nTo reiterate, we **strongly** encourage you to refer to our contributing guides **before** beginning work on this issue. Failure to follow our guidelines significantly decreases the likelihood that you'll successfully contribute to stdlib and may result in automatic closure of a pull request without review.\n\nSetting up your local development environment is a critical first step, as doing so ensures that automated development processes for linting, license verification, and unit testing can run prior to authoring commits and pushing changes. If you would prefer to avoid manual setup, we provide pre-configured [development containers](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/tree/develop/.devcontainer) for use locally or in GitHub Codespaces.\n\nWe place a high value on consistency throughout the stdlib codebase. We encourage you to closely examine other packages in stdlib and attempt to emulate the practices and conventions found therein.\n\n-   If you are attempting to contribute a new package, sometimes the best approach is to simply copy the contents of an existing package and then modify the minimum amount necessary to implement the feature (e.g., changing descriptions, parameter names, and implementation).\n-   If you are contributing tests, find a package implementing a similar feature and emulate the tests of that package.\n-   If you are updating documentation, examine several similar packages and emulate the content, style, and prose of those packages.\n\nIn short, the more effort you put in to ensure that your contribution looks and feels like stdlib???including variables names, bracket spacing, line breaks, etc???the more likely that your contribution will be reviewed and ultimately accepted. We encourage you to closely study the codebase **before** beginning work on this issue.\n\n:sparkles: Thank you again for your interest in stdlib, and we look forward to reviewing your future contributions. :sparkles:\n" ],

Thank you! ", "@gian-benito it should be a text field. This textfield might be validated by parsing its content as an OSgi Filter (e.g. `FrameworkUtil.createFilter(....)`)", "When running our project, we faced these specific error messages, which we believe might be the reason we aren???t seeing any changes. We are all using Eclipse IDE for Eclipse Committers and running the eclipse pde project inside the IDE: \n\n<img width=\"483\" height=\"316\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c90446d1-230f-48e8-a3a9-b0d3149b6fdd\" />\n\n<img width=\"851\" height=\"673\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b3abdfe-c8c7-415b-907e-67f6c3e2acbc\" />\n\nDespite these error messages, Eclipse IDE still allowed us to run a runtime application. My team and I have tried modifying the pderesources.properties, under the UI directory,  by changing the variable MatchSection_title. We also commented out lines that called the section and description UI. After making the changes, it did not reflect in the runtime application. \n\nTo resolve the errors, we rebuilt and cleaned the project, cloned it into a new workspace, and updated the Eclipse IDE, but these steps still did not affect the errors. Furthermore, we tried manually adding the missing bundles but were unable to locate them. \n \nAdditionally, we wanted to confirm if MatchSection.java, under org.eclipse.pde.internal.ui.editor.plugin, is the correct file that pertains to our issue. We found functions in this file that included the variables that called ???Dependency Properties???, ???Version to match:???, and ???Match rule:???. Based on this, we concluded that we should add logic for a text field in this file. \n\n@KN0987 @BAlgarra\n" ],

      "comments" : [ "Hi @PhilipSharman,\n\nThis is related to a recent change in Processing 4.4.3 where we updated the default `pixelDensity()` setting to match your display???s density. It makes sketches look sharper on high-DPI screens, but it has caused a few side effects that we are addressing as they are reported.\n\nThanks for catching that one!\n", "I'm not sure that this is a bug -- or at least, the switch to setting pixelDensity by default was a breaking change. The difficulty here is that, as far as I can tell, `get`/`set` are currently expressed in terms of physical pixels loaded from the underlying graphics buffer. For sketches prior to forcing a high dpi pixel density in `4.4.3`, logical = physical and so that was no problem.\n\nThe problem is, if you assume `get`/`set` are logical coordinates, this introduces a number of other problems, particularly if fractional scaling support were to be implemented (which it should, I'm guessing things might be wonky on fractional displays atm). Basically, when converting a logical to physical coordinate, what should happen? Should we use nearest neighbor or area sampling? What if the user *wants* to be able to fetch each physical pixel (i.e. logical sub-pixel)? This could represent a breaking change in the other direction.\n\nI think some solutions here could be to: \n- revert https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/1038\n- clarify in the docs that `get`/`set` refer to physical pixels\n- add a `getLogical`/`setLogical` variant\n- potentially add a global `pixelAccessMode()` flag\n\nEither way @PhilipSharman you should be able to work around this at the moment by setting `pixelDensity(1);` in your project `setup`.", "Hi @tychedelia and thanks for your input and thoughtful suggestions.\n\nI think matching `displayDensity` was the right call. It makes all sketches look better on high DPI screens by default, and I???d rather not revert it if we can avoid it. That said, we???ll probably need to look more closely at what else this change may have affected.\n\nBesides, I believe most users expect ???pixels??? to refer to logical coordinates (`size()` works that way, for example) and probably don't know about pixel density. Introducing the notion of physical pixels too early could be confusing for beginners. \n\nI???d suggest keeping `get()` and `set()` in logical space, averaging over physical pixels when needed. That keeps most existing code working as before and matches user expectation.\n\nIf necessary for advanced use, a `pixelMode(PHYSICAL)` flag feels most consistent with Processing???s API design. It would be a breaking change, but only for users already working with `pixelDensity(x)` and `get()`/`set()`, who likely understand the distinction between physical and logical pixels.", "> I think matching displayDensity was the right call. It makes all sketches look better on high DPI screens by default, and I???d rather not revert it unless absolutely necessary.\n\nFor sure, it's def the right call from a default perspective. I agree that the logical/physical distinction can be pretty confusing to new users. It hurts my head constantly too! Especially when fractional scaling is involved.\n\nMy concern is with the `pixels` array that the `get`/`set` methods point users towards using. Even if you do sampling/blending on the CPU in `get`/`set`, the backing buffer will still be misized.\n\nIf you're okay with declaring all pixel operations to always be logical, I think the right call then would be to add a downres framebuffer and perform sampling on the GPU, always reading back into a pixel buffer that is the same as `size` (and vice versa for upres). That way, `pixelDensity` would only affect the size of allocated GPU textures and not anything on the CPU. ", "That seems reasonable. I'm mostly focused on how it works in user space and the low-level details are a bit over my head ?????? As long as we agree on the user-facing behavior, I???ll defer to those with a deeper understanding of the optimal implementation. Thanks for taking the time to dig into this!\n\nEdit: This post on Reddit has a good demonstration of the issue https://www.reddit.com/r/processing/comments/1l5siua/odd_get_behaviour/", "Have a working solution that I opened in #1145, but as I noted at the bottom, I'm still not totally sure forcing all operations to be logical is the right approach? Or at least it makes me nervous. Pedagogically, I think it is and continue to agree with the decision in general to force high dpi scaling when available, but there's definite backwards compatibility and documentation things that should be thought about more careful, I think.", "Hi @tychedelia, thanks so much for your thoughtful work on this and for opening the draft PR! Sorry we???ve been a bit slow to respond; we???re in the middle of reviewing candidates for the 2025 `pr05` grant and juggling other org work. I hope to be a little more on top of things starting next month.\n\nHappy to think through how we can communicate this change better, both in the reference and maybe with clearer console warnings. Let me know if you have any suggestions for how best to do this.\n\nThanks again for diving into this!", "Greetings, I am working with @npNSU and @kaybcodes, and we ran the example code on both Windows and macOS, and we noticed that the output is completely different!

The user is allowed to use the \"x\" chip to remove their selection.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe user, per the documentation on the single-persist selection mode, should not be able to clear the selected item.\n\n### Reproduction Sample\n\nhttps://developers.arcgis.com/calcite-design-system/components/combobox/\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Open the sample page\n2. Change the selection mode to \"single-persist\"\n3. Select an item in the combobox\n4. Click on the gray \"x\" chip button in the combo-box\n\n### Reproduction Version\n\n2.11.1\n\n### Relevant Info\n\nWindows 11, Edge, Firefox and Chrome. No console errors/warnings.\n\n### Regression?\n\nNot sure.\n\n### Priority impact\n\nimpact - p3 - not time sensitive\n\n### Impact\n\nRequires adding additional scripting logic alongside the component to account for the possibility of user deselection.\n\n### Calcite package\n\n- [X] @esri/calcite-components\n- [ ] @esri/calcite-components-angular\n- [ ] @esri/calcite-components-react\n- [ ] @esri/calcite-design-tokens\n- [ ] @esri/eslint-plugin-calcite-components\n\n### Esri team\n\nN/A\n\n---\n\nRefer to https://github.com/Esri/calcite-design-system/issues/10163#issuecomment-3074355599 for the proposed solution.",

I see the following options:\n\n1. ignore `clearDisabled` when `selection-mode=\"single-persist\"` is set (maybe warn about ignoring `clearDisabled` in dev builds)\n2. drop `single-persist` and recommend using `selection-mode=\"single\"` + `clearDisabled` to achieve the same behavior (future breaking change and slightly inconsistent with other selection components)\n3. keep things as-is and document this \"quirk\"\n\nEach has tradeoffs, but 1 seems the least surprising from a developer???s perspective, IMO.", "@ashetland shared some thoughts and we were both thinking about the same outcome (1), but expressing it differently. To recap, what we need to do is prevent clearing selection when `selection-mode=\"single-persist\"` regardless of what `clearDisabled` is. We should also log a dev-build warning when `clearDisabled` is set to true for this mode." ],

While we still expect tuned CUTLASS kernels to provide the best performance, it would be nice to have a reference Triton implementation available as a fallback if no other kernels are available.\n\nIt seems Triton has supported FP4 formats for several months so we should have a new enough version of Triton https://github.com/triton-lang/triton/blob/620237edd282d3fa275e7f931af2018423108c4a/python/test/unit/language/test_matmul.py#L652\n\nA good starting point would be to add the triton kernel directly to https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/main/benchmarks/kernels/bench_nvfp4_gemm.py and compare the performance to the CUTLASS kernel, before integrating with vLLM as a whole\n\n### Alternatives\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Before submitting a new issue...\n\n- [x] Make sure you already searched for relevant issues, and asked the chatbot living at the bottom right corner of the [documentation page](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/), which can answer lots of frequently asked questions.",

Add support for exogenous variables (`X`) to Chronos Bolt Forecaster:\n   - I plan to support exogenous variables by fitting a covariate regressor on `X ??? y` during training, then training Chronos-Bolt on the residuals (`y - y_exog`). \n   - At prediction time, I'll add the regressor's forecast from X to Chronos-Bolt???s residual forecast to produce the final output.\n\n2. Add a `mode` parameter (`\"default\"`, `\"few-shot\"`, `\"zero-shot\"`) inside `__init__` to control behavior when data is limited\n   - Allow `predict()` to work in zero-shot mode when `fit()` is skipped\n   - Ensure the model works with small `y` in few-shot mode\n\n3. Keep a unified `ChronosForecaster` class and route logic via the existing `ChronosBoltStrategy` vs `ChronosDefaultStrategy`\n   - I believe the differences between them are manageable, so a single class feels appropriate for now.\n\nLet me know if you'd like this plan refined or if you'd prefer splitting the forecaster class from the start!\n", "Thanks for explaining!\n\n> I plan to support exogenous variables by fitting a covariate regressor on `X ??? y` during training, then training Chronos-Bolt on the residuals (`y - y_exog`). \n\nI think this is the wrong approach.\n\nThe issue is asking to check whether chronos-bolt has exogenous feature (according to @mabuimo the paper claims such), and ensure it is properly interfaced by the `sktime` API.\n\nDo not add extrinsic functionality to chronos-bolt, but use the feature of the existing pre-trained model.", "Hi @fkiraly ,\n\nI???ve reviewed the Chronos-Bolt (Bolt) blog and the current implementation in AutoGluon-TimeSeries to understand how exogenous variables (covariates) are handled.\n\n### Chronos-Bolt and Exogenous Variables (from the blog)\nChronos-Bolt is designed as a **univariate** time series forecasting model. According to the paper, Bolt relies solely on the historical target series for generating forecasts and does not natively accept exogenous variables (covariates) as direct inputs during inference or training.\n\n### How Exogenous Variables are Used in Practice (AutoGluon Implementation)\nIn practice, when using Bolt within AutoGluon-TimeSeries, exogenous variables are incorporated through a covariate regressor workaround:\n\n - A tabular regressor (e.g., CatBoost) is first fit on the known covariates to predict the target at each time step.\n\n - The predictions from the covariate regressor are subtracted from the target, and Bolt is then used to forecast the residuals.\n\n - The final forecast combines the covariate regressor???s prediction with Bolt???s prediction of the residual component.\n\n### Summary\nBolt does **NOT** natively support exogenous variables as model inputs.\n\n### The workaround uses a two-stage pipeline:\n(1) regressor predicts from covariates,\n(2) Bolt forecasts residuals from the target???s history.", "Thanks, @Sanchay117, for your careful analysis!\n\nI have reviewed this and indeed you are right - Amazon seem to be using a \"hack\" to make chronos \"exogenous\" capable.\n\nThis capability has nothing to do with the training of the foundation model, it is a simple hack - more precisely, a reduction step - that can be used for any forecaster.\n\nTherefore, I would suggest to implement a `ResidualBoostingForecaster` like in this new issue: https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/8581\n\nWith this new forecaster, the \"chronos with exogenous\" algorithm will be\n\n```python\nResidualBoostingForecaster(\n    base_forecaster=YfromX(Catboost()), \n    residual_forecaster=ChronosForecaster()\n)\n```\n\nso the `ChronosForecaster` in `sktime` is only the \"clean\" foundation model, and other meta-algorithms could be used for using the exogenous variables.\n\nI would also keep them separate, because the \"hack\" introduces constraints that the original foundation model does not have, e.g., the requiremen to see at least as much exogenous data as there are indices in the endogenous data.", "What do you think, @mabuimo?" ],

Interestingly, the documentation states the following:\n\n```\nsave_words:\nbool, default = True\nWhether to keep NumPy array of words in SFA transformation even after the dictionary of words is returned.

Currently, MarkItDown doesn't support parsing or converting .chm files into Markdown. Adding support for .chm files would significantly improve the flexibility of this tool when dealing with older help documentation formats.\n\n??? Proposed Solution:\n\nI propose implementing a module that extracts .chm content, converts the internal HTML pages into Markdown, and packages them into the standard MarkItDown processing pipeline.\n\n\uD83D\uDEE0??? Implementation Plan:\n\nRead .chm Files:\n\nUse Python bindings like [pychm](https://pypi.org/project/pychm/) or wrap a system-level parser like chmlib.\n\nExtract the Table of Contents (TOC), topic files, and internal HTML pages.\n\nConvert HTML to Markdown:\n\nUse libraries like html2text or markdownify to convert each HTML page into clean Markdown syntax.\n\nOptionally preserve internal links, headers, and styles in a user-friendly way.\n\nIntegrate with MarkItDown Pipeline:\n\nAdd a new CLI input handler for .chm files.\n\nConvert the extracted Markdown content into standard MarkItDown output formats (e.g., .md, .html, .pdf).\n\nTesting:\n\nCreate a small .chm sample file for testing.\n\nAdd unit tests for file extraction, HTML parsing, and Markdown output.\n\nTest edge cases: corrupted .chm, multilingual CHM files, or those with heavy formatting.\n\nDocumentation:\n\nUpdate the README and CLI usage docs to mention .chm support.\n\nAdd notes about any library dependencies (like libchm or pychm).\n\n\uD83E\uDDE0 Why This Matters:\n\n.chm support bridges the gap between legacy formats and modern Markdown workflows.\n\nIt expands MarkItDown???s use cases into software documentation migration, archival research, and technical content revival.\n\nWorking with binary help formats shows technical depth and builds resilience in file parsing logic.\n\n\uD83D\uDCDD Notes:\n\nThe implementation can be modular to allow future support for similar compiled help formats like .hlp or .hhp.\n\nFor large .chm files, consider chunking the content into multiple .md files, one per topic or chapter.\n\nUsers should be able to optionally export the entire .chm as a zip archive of .md files.\n\n\uD83D\uDE80 Ready to Start:\nIf this approach aligns with project goals, I???d love to submit a PR implementing this feature.

This is currently achieved with 3 parts: \n\n* **[wexec](https://github.com/tractordev/wanix/tree/main/shell/wexec)**: Linux executable that uses `/task` to allocate, start, and attach STDIO to a `wasi` task for a Wasm executable\n* **[preload](https://github.com/tractordev/wanix/tree/main/shell/preload)**: Linux library that decorates libc `execve`, `execvp`, `execvpe` to use `wexec` if there is a `.wasm` file extension\n* **[init](https://github.com/tractordev/wanix/blob/main/shell/bin/init)**: shell init script that ultimately runs the Busybox shell with LD_PRELOAD pointing to `preload`\n\nAs a side effect of this approach, we cannot build Busybox as a static binary because using LD_PRELOAD requires the dynamic linker (ld-linux), which then means we need a handful of files in `/lib`.\n\nWe could drop most of the `/lib` files, the `preload` component entirely, and go back to using a static build of Busybox by using [binfmt_misc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binfmt_misc) to simply register `wexec` as the \"handler\" for `.wasm` files. \n\nSeems ideal, but I've never used it before and only learned about it just as I got the ld_preload approach working.",

The following pages should help you to get started:\n- https://github.com/eclipse-ide/\n- https://github.com/eclipse-pde/eclipse.pde?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-contribute\n\nand if you have further questions, don't hesitate to ask, we are here to help.", "Hey guys, I'm working on this issue in a group with ahenden13. We were wondering if anybody has thoughts on how we should format the display, as there is a lot of unhelpful information. \n\nWe are inclined to just remove these useless bits, but we could also just remove the error bits, leave everything and bold the set bits, etc. If anyone has any input it would be appreciated!", "I think the main issue is that you can not know programmatically what styles a widget support at the moment.\n\nSo the first thing would be to have some declarative way (e.g. an annotation) to carry that information and update all widgets to use that thing before one can make progress here. Hardcoding the supported styles seem not very useful to me.", "That makes a lot of sense. @neilcabanilla and I found the method getStyle() in [SpyView.java](https://github.com/eclipse-pde/eclipse.pde/blob/master/ui/org.eclipse.swt.tools.spies/src/org/eclipse/swt/tools/views/SpyView.java) which we could borrow to easily grab only the relevant style bits for a given widget and then bold the styles that are currently being used. The downside to this function is that it uses a lot of long if...else statements to manually grab the set style bits one by one, with hardcoded styles. We have a solution ready to go using this method, and we could do a PR right now.\n\nWhat you are advising is we instead use something like an annotation. We could try to build this and do a PR for SWT, or we could try to build a similar solution within Eclipse PDE. For example, we could use a format like a registry of SWT styles, which might look something like:\n\npublic class Registry {\n    private hashmap;\n\n    static {\n        hashmap.put(Button.class, Set.of(\n            SWT.PUSH,\n            SWT.CHECK,\n            SWT.RADIO,\n            SWT.TOGGLE\n        ));\n\n        //etc\n    }\n\n    public static Set<Integer> getStyles(Class) {\n        // return styles for a given class\n    }\n}\n\nThis is probably less optimal than adding something to the widget class directly, but it is a lot more human-readable than the getStyle() idea and allows us to update everything a lot easier down the line. \n\nWhat should our next steps be? Should we do a PR with what we have now, build a new solution in the format I described here, try to create a solution by modifying the widget class itself, or do something else?", "> What you are advising is we instead use something like an annotation.\n\nI do not advise to use _something like an annotation_ but to use an annotation. e.g it could be a repeatable `@Style` with and int value and an optional String description. If we choose retention of runtime that information could be easily queried by tools (even e.g. in autocompletion or validation) to learn about valid styles what currently is only documented in the javadoc (and sadly even only in the class description and not at the constructor).\n\n> The downside to this function is that it uses a lot of long if...else statements to manually grab the set style bits one by one, with hardcoded styles.\n\nThe most limiting factor is that there is literally no way for it to be used with custom widgets outside of what we know at platform / SWT.", "Hello @laeubi,\n\nI am in team with @WillPeltz  & @ahenden13. We were exploring information regarding Annotations you've previously mentioned. Based on our understanding here is what we came up with\n\n```\nimport java.lang.annotation.Retention;\nimport java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy;\nimport java.lang.annotation.Repeatable;\n\n@Repeatable(Styles.class)\n@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)\npublic @interface Style {\n    int value();                //Store style value i.e. SWT.BORDER\n    String description() default \"\";  //  A description = Creates a Border\n}\n\n\n//Container to support repeatability (For multiple styles in a widget)\nimport java.lang.annotation.Retention;\nimport java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy;\n\n@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)\npublic @interface Styles {\n    Style[] value();\n}\n```\nWe could put this interface in the SWT repositories or make a wrapper class in PDE.\n\nDoes this align with the approach you have in your mind? \n\nThank you so much!\n" ],

Please consider supporting our collective:\r\n\uD83D\uDC49  https://opencollective.com/cboard/donate -->\r\nDear CBoard team, I am a speech and langauge therapist in Asia. I support students (e.g. with Cerebral Palsy) who have motor difficulties which leads to them struggling with the scrolling feature on the app vocabulary pages. When I trialled CBoard with these students, the scrolling of the screen made it hard for them to select vocabulary accurately. Is there a way to remove the scrolling feature, and instead access the symbols via pages? (E.g. select a button for 'Next Page' and disabling the scrolling on the screen?) Thank you very much! Your advice will be very appreciated. Best wishes, Dawn : )",

      "description" : "### Bug description\n\nWhen configuring dashboard filters with the \"Values are dependent on other filters\" option, the system prevents creating bi-directional dependencies upfront by showing a \"Cyclic dependency detected\" message. However, it allows creating the same dependency indirectly after saving the initial filter configuration.\n\n1. If Filter A is set to depend on Filter B, the system blocks setting Filter B to depend on Filter A immediately, showing a \"Cyclic dependency detected\" message.\n2. However, if Filter A is saved with the dependency on Filter B, the system later allows editing Filter B to create the reverse dependency, effectively forming a bi-directional (cyclic) dependency.\n\nThis behavior is inconsistent and might lead to unexpected filter behavior. It appears to contradict the intended prevention of cyclic dependencies.\nHow to reproduce the bug\n\n1. Create a dashboard filter (e.g., Filter A) with a dependency on another filter (e.g., Filter B) by enabling the Values are dependent on other filters option.\n2. Save the filter configuration.\n3. Open the dashboard filter configuration again, select Filter B, and set it to depend on Filter A.\n4. Save the changes.\n\n## Expected results\n\nThe system should prevent bi-directional (cyclic) dependencies for all filter types, not just date filters. Users should not be able to create a cyclic dependency by editing the filters after saving the initial configuration.\n\n## Actual results\n\nThe platform allows creating cyclic dependencies indirectly after the initial configuration, even though it prevents it upfront. This behavior is inconsistent and may lead to unexpected filter behavior.\n\n### Screenshots/recordings\n\n_No response_\n\n### Superset version\n\nmaster / latest-dev\n\n### Python version\n\n3.11\n\n### Node version\n\n18 or greater\n\n### Browser\n\nChrome\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Checklist\n\n- [x] I have searched Superset docs and Slack and didn't find a solution to my problem.\n- [x] I have searched the GitHub issue tracker and didn't find a similar bug report.\n- [x] I have checked Superset's logs for errors and if I found a relevant Python stacktrace, I included it here as text in the \"additional context\" section.",

This because we always assume to receive new ES output in update https://github.com/elastic/connectors/blob/main/connectors/agent/protocol.py#L134\n\nIf we restart the agent component stuff works fine (and we end up creating xd-456 connector)\n\n```\n[elastic_agent.python_elastic_agent_client][info] Connector input found. Service type: google_drive, Connector ID: xd-456, Connector Name: Google Drive Custom ID\n11:24:32.893\nelastic_agent.python_elastic_agent_client\nconnectors-py-default\n[elastic_agent.python_elastic_agent_client][warning] No Elasticsearch output found\n```\n\n\n### To Reproduce\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n1. Create agentless connector policy with connector id defined \n2. It should create a connector with this id\n3. Update policy with new connector id\n4. No new connector created\n5. Restart the agent\n6. New connector created as expected\n\n\n### TO do\nMake it work with delta updates of policy\n",

Its purpose is to ensure physical compatibility for the symmetry condition, and the name field is irrelevant for that specific check.\n\nThanks again for bringing this to our attention!

The latest getting started command, `tethys quickstart`, sets up a portal in single-app mode (i.e. MULTIPLE_APP_MODE = false in the the portal_config) with the tethysapp-hello_world application as the STANDALONE_APP. This makes a lot of sense if there is only ever going to be a single app. If the user decides to install an additional app that they want displayed in a multi-app portal, they will have to run the `tethys settings` command or edit the `MULTIPLE_APP_MODE` option directly in the portal_config. This seems like an opportunity to be \"smart\" and streamline the experience for the users.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIf a user installs another application when `MULTIPLE_APP_MODE = false` then as part of the install they should be prompted if they'd like to either switch to multiple app mode or swap the current standalone app with this new one.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe only alternative is to do nothing and make the user manually do this.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nWe'd need to make sure that these prompts gets skipped if an install is executed with a \"no prompts\" options, which I'm sure we have for automated executions.\r\n",

It would be nice to have a `--environment <slug>` flag that would override the currently set environment in `keyshade.json`. \n\nUsecase:\n```sh\nkeyshade run --environment stage-0 \"npm run start\"\n```\n\n## Solution\n\n- Update the `run.command.ts` file in `apps/cli` package to accept an optional `environment` flag\n- If the flag is specified, we would like this value to take precedence over the one specified in `keyshade.json`\n",

We managed to get this feature to work per the specifications, but we would like some feedback on our implementation, if we???re on the right track, or any adjustments we might need to make. Any guidance would be appreciated!\n\nFirstly, in RunCommand, we overrode the getOptions method from the BaseCommand class in our RunCommand and configured it to accept an optional environment-slug flag with both a short and long version.\n\n<img width=\"619\" height=\"270\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4f9312a-2f8f-4ff2-8830-1d574687d2dc\" />\n\nWe verified that this works by printing our passed in slug to the console when we would run the keyshade run command.\n\nWe investigated through the codebase and found a file called `update.config.ts` which seemed to already have logic created for updating the keyshade.json file. Using this, we decided to reference and borrow some of that logic for our RunCommand, creating a private helper function called updateEnvironmentConfig, and calling that in our action method if the environmentSlug flag was passed in:\n\n<img width=\"621\" height=\"270\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2da2d78-5e6f-4c5e-89c8-a4dee2f49847\" />\n\n<img width=\"617\" height=\"165\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a3d18b2-4f3e-4035-b5a3-ce4dcf548303\" />\n\nWe tested this using a demo NextJS application that we created, and verified that the environment in our keyshade.json file is successfully being overwritten with the one passed in using the environment slug flag.\n\n**Some Questions**\nGiven that our implementation does borrow logic from existing functions/code in `update.config.ts`, to keep code reuse at a minimum, one idea we had was to delegate our config update methods into a singular utility method which can be reused in both RunCommand and UpdateConfig. Does this sound like a good approach? If somebody could direct us on where code reuse is practiced within the codebase that'd be helpful as well!\n\nFurthermore, there seems to be no proper validation for whether or not the passed in environment exists within the user???s workspace. As of right now, if you change the environment slug to an environment that does not exist, it throws an API Error. We were wondering if there should be some kind of validation for existing environments so that the error that gets thrown is specific to a non-existent environment. \n\nAny feedback or advice would be greatly appreciated!\n", "Hey there! The purpose of the flag would be to override the environment slug at runtime, in memory only. We won't need you to write that to the keyshade.json file! \n\n> there seems to be no proper validation for whether or not the passed in environment exists\n\nYes you are correct, we don't yet do any validation in here. But the run command validates this on startup and fails if there's invalid configuration.", "Oh okay! Thank you for clarifying. So we just need to change the environment at run time. Just adjusted our implementation to reflect the issue more accurately and made a pull request!" ],

      "description" : "### What happened?\n\n**Description:**\n\nFirst off, thank you for creating such a powerful and useful tool! The Gemini CLI is a fantastic piece of work.\n\nI've noticed a small rendering issue with tables in the terminal. When a Markdown table is displayed, the columns don't seem to align correctly, which can make them a bit tricky to read. This happens for me on both wide and narrow terminal screens.\n\nIt seems like the model is generating perfect Markdown, because when I see the same table in the web UI, it looks great. This suggests the issue might be in how the CLI client renders the Markdown for a terminal environment.\n\nI know that getting tables to format perfectly in every terminal is a tough challenge, but I wanted to bring this to your attention in case it's helpful for future improvements. Thank you for all your hard work on this project for the good of humanity!\n\n\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\n\n1. Run a command that displays a table, for example, by asking a question that results in a table in the response.\n2. Observe that the table formatting is broken, regardless of terminal width.\n\n**Actual Behavior:**\n\nThe table formatting is broken, with columns becoming misaligned.\n\n**Environment:**\n\n* Gemini CLI Version: 0.1.9\n* OS: All\n\nSample Image of Text Based Table on Gemini-Cli \n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a8f858f-c672-4fbe-bcbc-00536b6e31b9)\n\nSample Image of Text Based Table on Web-Gemini (longer text with scroll bar)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57f9838b-ab7b-4cf0-8b1c-62eb53c08c6c)\n\nSample Image of Text Based Table on Claude-Code\n//First table is Broken\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9932ec05-5f5c-49a0-be0f-b3eb3bb8743a)\n\n//Second & Third Table generated with shorter text\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48a8827f-a530-4b10-ab7a-258f25ed073b)\n\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\n**Expected Behavior:**\n\nThe table should render with correct column alignment, ensuring readability.\n\n### Client information\n\n\n*   **CLI Version:** 0.1.7\n*   **Git Commit:** 55cc809\n*   **Operating System:** linux v20.19.2\n*   **Sandbox Environment:** no sandbox\n*   **Model Version:** gemini-2.5-pro\n*   **Memory Usage:** 215.2 MB\n\n\n### Login information\n\nGoogle Account\n\n### Anything else we need to know?\n\n_No response_",

PowerShell completions for their CLI are handled by invoking the CLI itself from a tiny bit of PowerShell.  Like this:\r\n```powershell\r\nRegister-ArgumentCompleter -Native -CommandName dotnet {\r\n    param($commandName, $wordToComplete, $cursorPosition)\r\n    dotnet complete --position $cursorPosition \"$wordToComplete\" | ForEach-Object {\r\n        [System.Management.Automation.CompletionResult]::new($_, $_, 'ParameterValue', $_)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd PowerShell has differently named 'profile' scripts depending on which host is running PowerShell, if you really want to append stuff to the script automatically, it would probably be better to use the current value of `$profile`, which in the common interactive console host is Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1, not profile.ps1.  You certainly don't want your completions being loaded into non-interactive hosts.\r\n\r\n> i remember having to do many weird things in this script to get the script to work reliably on all testing devices as well as report helpful errors when possible (one example is irm is slow in powershell 5, but curl sometimes fails, and iwr can fail on newly installed systems). im very interested in what specifically you find unpleasant.\r\n\r\nIt is a long list.  I'd like to see bun succeed on Windows though, so happy to help if you are interested.  Do you want me to ramble on here, or is there a better place?\r\n\r\nA big first question would be, are you sure there's merit in supporting PowerShell 5?  It is a quite different environment, and yes, it's pre-installed, but I'd be surprised if many Windows developers who prefer command line environments are still using it instead of 6 or 7.  And of course, if you are concerned about supporting older systems, the real curl wasn't included with Windows until three years into Windows 10s lifecycle.  That may be why it is failing in some cases for you.", "> The best practice version would be something more like the dotnet SDK does.\r\n\r\nthis is reasonable, so the powershell version of autocompletions for us would be implemented in zig. it reminds me there is already a `bun getcompletes` command but i dont think it is properly setup for this. it would have to be modified on windows.\r\n\r\n> Do you want me to ramble on here, or is there a better place?\r\n\r\nmaybe would be good as a separate issue. please tag me in it so it pops up in my inbox, otherwise i wont see it.\r\n\r\nthis issue will remain for implementing completions for windows\r\n\r\n> Are you sure there's merit in supporting PowerShell 5\r\n\r\nI want to ensure that any version past Windows 10 1809 is able to install Bun without any extra work, though the c++ redistributable is required (see #8598 for eliminating this).\r\n\r\n> I'd be surprised if many Windows developers who prefer command line environments are still using it instead of 6 or 7\r\n\r\nI would be too, but I expect that if this didn't work out of the box, people would report \"bugs\" about it, not even realizing what PowerShell 7 vs 5 means. Because of that, the script has to be idiot proof and impossible to fail, which means making it work on powershell 5\r\n\r\nThere used to be these sorts of things with the linux installer, where the mistake should be obvious, but a small percent of users are confused and ask for help.\r\n\r\n> real curl wasn't included with Windows until three years into Windows 10s lifecycle. That may be why it is failing in some cases for you.\r\n\r\nthat may be it. i have this weird fallback thing in the script right now that covers for it. i noticed curl.exe was faster than powershell 5 invoke-restmethod, so i still try it\r\n", "Also, if you would like to contribute to the install script, that would be appreciated. However, there was one done in the past, but I rejected it because it dropped PowerShell 5 support.", "I added another attempt at this using a slightly different approach. The completers for all shells seem to be manually maintained when it would be better long term for bun getcompletes to do most of the heavy lifting. https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/10424\r\n\r\n> As someone who uses PowerShell as their daily driver, if a tool silently adds a thousand lines of script to the end of my profile.ps1 without warning or consent, I'll instantly ban it from all systems I'm responsible for, no matter it's other merits.\r\n\r\nIt uses the current profile so as not to pollute non-interactive hosts and is a one-liner to make it easier to cleanup. It's dot sourcing an external completion script stored in the users ~/.bun dir because there's no sane cross platform place to put completion scripts in pwsh.\r\n\r\n```pwsh\r\ntry { . ~/.bun/bun.completion.ps1 } catch { Write-Warning 'Failed to load bun autocompletion' }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not 100% sure on how dirty I feel extracting the flags output from `bun --help` but the alternative of hard coding the current state of the flags in the shell completion script is worse IMO.\r\n\r\n> this is reasonable, so the powershell version of autocompletions for us would be implemented in zig  \r\n\r\nYou could do something like `bun getcompletes \"bun run --\"` from any shell and it would do the autocomplete in getcompletes then all the shell completion scripts would be very simple - I think this is how complete for things like kubectl/aws work at a high level. But the reality is that's a lot of work to do for what is not a huge ROI so the current state might be good enough until someone wants to tackle shell completion in a general sense." ],

And make sure the `cpy` library is installed:\r\n```\r\nbun init\r\nbun i cpy\r\n```\r\n\r\nMake a file called **dir1/a.txt**:\r\n```\r\naaaa\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother file called **index.ts**:\r\n```\r\nimport cpy from 'cpy';\r\n\r\ntry {\r\n    await cpy('./dir1/**', './dir2');\r\n} catch (err) {\r\n    console.log((err as Error).stack);\r\n    throw err;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen run it:\r\n```\r\nbun index.ts \r\n```\r\n\r\n### What is the expected behavior?\r\n\r\nCopy of `dir1/a.txt` to `dir2/a.txt`. This is what `node` does.\r\n\r\n### What do you see instead?\r\n\r\n```\r\nError: Cannot read from `/Users/ryan/crap/issue-reports/bun/cpy1/dir1/a.txt`: undefined is not an object\r\n    at <anonymous> (/Users/ryan/crap/issue-reports/bun/cpy1/node_modules/cp-file/fs.js:20:81)\r\n    at asyncFunctionResume (native)\r\n    at promiseReactionJobWithoutPromiseUnwrapAsyncContext (native)\r\n    at promiseReactionJob (native)\r\n    at processTicksAndRejections (native)\r\nCaused By: TypeError: undefined is not an object\r\n    at <anonymous> (node:stream:1743:162)\r\n    at <anonymous> (/Users/ryan/crap/issue-reports/bun/cpy1/node_modules/p-event/index.js:71:13)\r\n    at new Promise (:1:11)\r\n    at pEventMultiple (/Users/ryan/crap/issue-reports/bun/cpy1/node_modules/p-event/index.js:19:12)\r\n    at pEvent (/Users/ryan/crap/issue-reports/bun/cpy1/node_modules/p-event/index.js:104:18)\r\n    at <anonymous> (/Users/ryan/crap/issue-reports/bun/cpy1/node_modules/cp-file/fs.js:19:10)\r\n    at createReadStream (/Users/ryan/crap/issue-reports/bun/cpy1/node_modules/cp-file/fs.js:15:34)\r\n    at <anonymous> (/Users/ryan/crap/issue-reports/bun/cpy1/node_modules/cp-file/index.js:11:66)\r\n    at processTicksAndRejections (:55:39)\r\nCpyError: Cannot copy from `dir1/a.txt` to `dir2/a.txt`: Cannot read from `/Users/ryan/crap/issue-reports/bun/cpy1/dir1/a.txt`: undefined is not an object\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nIt seems the error is more related to a p-event library call.

But we cant really force all libraries like graceful-fs to swap to this `class` method.\r\n\r\n", "Identical issue with the library recursive-copy, which is using graceful-fs as well.", "this fix was applied to writestream but not readstream: we need to stop using an ES6 class for `ReadStream` as well as `NativeReadable`. code for this is in `src/js/node/fs.js` and `stream.js`", "After some poking around, I think I understand the problem.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// node_modules/graceful-fs.js:297\r\nfunction ReadStream (path, options) {\r\n    if (this instanceof ReadStream)\r\n      return fs$ReadStream.apply(**this**, arguments), *this*\r\n    else\r\n      return ReadStream.apply(Object.create(ReadStream.prototype), arguments)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n` **this** !== *this*`\r\n\r\n\\*\\*this** and \\*this* (ref. code above) are not the same, so although `apply` does its job, the `ReadStream`'s function returns the same reference passed to the original constructor of `ReadStream`.\r\nThe crash happens on the 'data' event when the function tries to access `this._readableState`, which is undefined. Probably because `gracful-fs` returns the wrong value based on the assumption that the `this` given is the `this` returned (by reference), which is incorrect in the current case.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// src/js/node/stream.js:2289\r\nReadable.prototype.on = function (ev, fn) {\r\n      const res = Stream.prototype.on.call(this, ev, fn);\r\n      const state = this._readableState;\r\n      if (ev === \"data\") {\r\n        **state.readableListening** = this.listenerCount(\"readable\") > 0;\r\n        if (state.flowing !== false) {\r\n          $debug(\"in flowing mode!\", this.__id);\r\n```\r\n\r\n`state.readableListening` cannot have value on the account `this._readableState` is undefined.\r\n\r\nRemoving `, *this*` on `graceful-fs.js` does the job, and everything is back to normal, which made me conclude somewhere in the code flow, the original object's reference gets lost, and a new one is returned instead.\r\nI tried to follow the constructors and figure out where it happens, but this is a tough bug to find, specifically without a debugger.\r\n\r\nDo you guys agree with my theory, or should I be looking for something else? \r\nIs it possible to throw a `debugger` keyword and follow it from a test project into Bun's core modules?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "(status update for Bun 1.1.10)\r\n\r\n- this now runs and exits with with no errors\r\n- does create `dir2/`\r\n- does create `dir2/a.txt`\r\n\r\nhowever I can confirm we are still lacking emitting the `'readable'` event in many cases and the file ends up with no content.\r\nthey should likely be using the `'data'` event but will continue to investigate this as it is probably affecting others as well\r\n" ],

How do we properly import the files over to the IDE so that we can work on them?\n2. How do we submit the finished code?\n3. Is the ticket asking us to modify two files or just one?\n4. How does this version-matching feature interact with tycho-cleancode: manifest? Do we need to implement any specific support or changes for that integration?\n5. From what we understand, the manifest editor already supports version matching when editing bundles or packages manually. For this issue, are we expected to reuse that existing version-matching logic and add it to the existing \"Organize Manifest\" wizard, or do we need to implement it as a separate feature?\n", "1.

You should look at that feature, examine how it works and then decide if it would be useful to reuse the existing functionality (what might require some refactorings) or if it should just be adopted in a similar way", "Ok, we believe we found what part of the code needs to be copied. Somewhere in the PluginVersionPart.java file. I am trying to run the code so that I can replicate the issue, but I can't seem to figure out how. I have tried running it by itself and running it with a couple of other files, but it does not seem to work. I think I may have to run the code through the terminal instead of the Eclipse IDE itself.

      "description" : "## Feature Description\n\nStarting in #10165 it was proposed to refactor several methods that hook into the `googlesitekit_inline_modules_data` filter, so they are consolidated into a single method `get_inline_data` that will return all data in the single method.\n\nFor consistency, we should do this in all modules, and preferably enforce this as with an interface. We can create `Module_With_Inline_data` interface that will force adding `get_inline_data` method, and new trait `Module_With_Inline_Data_Trait` that will include `register_inline_data` method, which will hook into the `googlesitekit_inline_modules_data` filter and invoke `get_inline_data` method.\n\nWe can then refactor all modules to use this new interface and trait, and it should be used in all new modules that are created in the future.\n\n---------------\n\n_Do not alter or remove anything below. The following sections will be managed by moderators only._\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n\n* New interface `Module_With_Inline_Data` is introduced to enforce the presence of a unified method on any module that provides inline data.\n* New trait `Module_With_Inline_Data_Trait` is introduced to include a registration method - which will hook into the `googlesitekit_inline_modules_data` and use the interface enforced method as a callback\n* Existing modules with inline data should be refactored to use the interface and trait for consistency.\n\n## Implementation Brief\n\n* [x] Add new interface `includes/Core/Modules/Module_With_Inline_Data.php` \n  *  It should enforce `get_inline_data` method which should return an array\n* [x] Add new trait `includes/Core/Modules/Module_With_Inline_Data_Trait.php`\n  * Include  `register_inline_data` method which hooks into the `googlesitekit_inline_modules_data` and uses `get_inline_data` as a callback\n* [x] Update following modules: \n  * `includes/Modules/Analytics_4.php`\n  * `includes/Modules/Ads.php`\n  * `includes/Modules/Sign_In_With_Google.php`\n    * Each should implement `Module_With_Inline_Data` interface and use `Module_With_Inline_Data_Trait` trait\n    * Refactor existing callback for `googlesitekit_inline_modules_data` hook to use new method `get_inline_data`\n    * In the `register` method, invoke `register_inline_data`\n* Search through codebase if any new module was added in the meantime which is also using the inline data, after this IB was written\n\n### Test Coverage\n\n* Update tests for updated modules to adapt the new method name usage\n\n## QA Brief (QA:ENG)\n\n* [ ] Setup Site Kit with Analytics and Ads enabled\n* [ ] Go to the Site Kit page\n* [ ] Type  `_googlesitekitModulesData` in the console\n\t* [ ] The object should have a `ads` key whose value is an object containing\n\t\t* [ ] supportedConversionEvents: array of supported conversion events\n\t\t\t* [ ] As a sanity check, install WooCommerce. This array should contain WooCommerce related events (`add-to-cart`, `purchase`)\n\t* [ ] The object should have `analytics-4` key whose value is an object containing\n\t\t* [ ] customDimensionsDataAvailable\n\t\t* [ ] resourceAvailabilityDates\n\t\t* [ ] tagIDMismatch\n\t\t* [ ] newEvents\n\t\t* [ ] lostEvents\n\t\t* [ ] newBadgeEvents\n\t* [ ] Without setting up Sign In With Google, the object should not have `sign-in-with-google`\n\t* [ ] With Sign In With Google setup, the object should have the `sign-in-with-google` and its value should be an object containing\n\t\t* [ ] isWooCommerceActive\n\t\t* [ ] isWooCommerceRegistrationEnabled\n\n\n## Changelog entry\n\n* N/A.\n",

I've assigned it back to you in Execution to add the QAB.", "@techanvil Done! Thanks for letting me know.", "Thanks @abdelmalekkkkk. The PR for the issue is good and I've gone ahead and merged it - congrats on your first merge!\n\nThat said - the current QAB is a bit too broad in scope; there's a lot of functionality associated with the Ads, Analytics and Sign in with Google modules, and QA engineers could spend time smoke testing unnecessary areas (or, more likely would ask you to advise them what they should be focusing on).\n\nTo make the QAB more specific, we should focus on the specific areas of functionality that the refactored code relates to, i.e. the functionality that depends on the pieces of inline data being present.\n\nTo identify these areas, I'd suggest searching for GitHub issues which mention the data keys, e.g. searching for [`supportedConversionEvents`](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Agoogle%2Fsite-kit-wp+supportedConversionEvents&type=issues), and use these issues and their QABs for smoke testing suggestions. Alternatively, use IDE tooling to help identify PRs and their linked issues (for example I use GitLens in Cursor/VS Code, although this [doesn't seem available](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZedEditor/comments/1b5q3dl/switched_to_zed_and_missing_gitlens/) for Zed).\n\nSimply linking to these issues with the direction to run through their QABs should suffice, rather than reproducing the QABs in this issue.\n\nThis is admittedly a bit fiddly as, despite the refactor itself being pretty straightforward, giving it a proper test means delving into some complex areas of functionality. Please feel free to reach out to me if you need any help with this.", "Thanks for the input @techanvil \n\nI figured it would be way more efficient to make this a QA ENG and just have the engineer make sure the inline module data is populated correctly with a simple console check, instead of having a QA try out all the different places that those pieces of inline data are used. I updated the QA brief accordingly.  Please let me know your thoughts." ],

      "comments" : [ "That switch actually controls three callout groups: intersections, transportation, and safety (e.g. steps and other hazards). Do we want to group safety with intersections or with transportation? Arguably the intersections are a type of safety callout, but perhaps the point of separating the intersection callout toggle is to allow everything except intersections to continue being called out.", "That's a great point :-) Perhaps we split out all 3 separately? All the other Callout options are quite binary whereas this one currently incorporates 3 different types...so splitting them out will allow a person to fine-tune the information they wish to hear. It will increase the panel and require more scrolling for the page...but I think it's worth doing. ", "\nI could also argue that the safety spots callout should remain on unless the user decides to turn all callouts off. In the early days of Microsoft Soundscape, there used to be a toggle switch for the Location Updates callout, but starting around the early 2020's,the Location Updates callout became permanently turned on and cannot directly be configured by the user. My argument to leave safety spots on is so that the user is always aware of anything hazardous while walking around. That way the \"Manage Callouts\" menu wouldn't be cluttered with too many configurations. If we decide to go ahead with my solution, I also wrote a revision to the help documentation explaining \"Note: some callouts essential for safe navigation do not have their own toggle switch and can only be disabled with the \"Allow Callouts\" button.\" Anyway, having all three callouts in this section or just Transportation and Intersections will be an improvement, even for sighted users. The term Mobility isn't as intuitive for the average user.", "I can look into this ", "Do we know which files in the backend are connected to the different toggles that we want from the Mobility section? ", "The code where the single toggle is changing three separate settings is here: https://github.com/soundscape-community/soundscape/blob/6a84924d63fc0a2542abac51d8c823832f0330d7/apps/ios/GuideDogs/Code/Visual%20UI/Controls/Settings/CalloutSettingsCellView.swift#L84-L90\n\nThe visual design for the toggle is in a storyboard: https://github.com/soundscape-community/soundscape/blob/6a84924d63fc0a2542abac51d8c823832f0330d7/apps/ios/GuideDogs/Code/Visual%20UI/Views/Settings.storyboard#L270-L317\n\nThat's all you should really need to tweak for this feature. You don't need to dive into how those settings are used by the `AutoCalloutGenerator` to filter the announcements.", "Just for clarification, I separated Transportation and Intersection into 2 different toggles. Before I make a pull request I want to confirm that we get rid of the Mobility toggle altogether and it just be the 2 new toggles?", "Based on your description, it looks like you are using my suggestion of leaving the safety callouts on permanently without a toggle switch. It might be a good idea to look at the advantages and drawbacks of the two suggestions. Would we rather have fewer toggle switches or a more customizable UI? My own suggestion has the safety callouts to not have a toggle switch so that the user is always aware of them in order to stay safe while walking. This may be good with cane or guide dog travel or for those individuals who are less experienced with O&M because a mobility device alone may not catch some safety spots. This solution also produces a less cluttered UI. You could argue in favor of the previous suggestion from Jchudge that having a toggle for safety callouts so the user turns off everything except for intersections may produce a more streamlined listening experience. That solution could be great for very experienced cane travelers who don't need that much guidance from Soundscape's callouts. The drawback is that the list of toggle switches looks a bit too long and overwhelming for beginners. Should we take a vote or something? Thanks.", "Mmm, I don't think we should make safety callouts permanently on.  There's a valid use case for the app  for low-vision non-cane users who don't need assistance finding steps and crosswalks but just want to hear road and shop signs they can't read.\n\nI'd suggest making three toggles, for mobility, transportation, and intersections. This shouldn't be much more difficult than two toggles, since the setting is already split into three under the hood.", "Thanks, since I don't object to having three separate toggle switches, should the new buttons be labeled \"Transportation,\" \"Intersections,\" and \"Safety?\" What should we do with the old \"Mobility\" switch? I assume that the \"Mobility\" or \"Safety\" button would be redundant if both buttons are in the UI so I think we can try either of two solutions. If we keep the \"Mobility\" label, and use the safety callouts for that label, then we should create an accessibility hint like \"Info for safe navigation.\" If you would rather go with \"Safety\" as the new callout name, the hint for the button could be written as \"Info for safe mobility.\" I can't come up with a good hint description right now, but you should get the gist. After everything is put together, the final list should be \"\"Allow Callouts,\" Places & Landmarks,\" \"Mobility\" or \"Safety,\" \"Transportation,\" \"Intersections,\" \"Distance to the Audio Beacon\" and \"Repeat Callouts.\" Maybe the order of callouts can be switched around a bit. Since the old \"Mobility\" hint said \"Intersection and Transportation Info,\" it may be better to put the \"Transportation\" button after the \"Intersection\" button for consistency.", "Ah, good point, the three categories should actually be Mobility, Safety, and Intersections. The \"Mobility\" category encompasses some random stuff that aren't directly related to modes of transportation, like ATMs and NaviLens codes.\n\nHere's a stab at the new hint text:\n* Mobility: Practical features like crosswalks and bus stops.\n* Safety: Potential hazards like steps and construction areas\n* Intersections: Announce street names and their directions", "So how I'm understanding what the final list should look like is this: \"Allow Callouts,\" \"Places & Landmarks,\" \"Mobility,\" \"Safety,\" \"Intersections,\" \"Distance to Audio Beacon,\" and \"Repeat Callouts.\" BTW, thanks for the new accessibility hints.", "> So how I'm understanding what the final list should look like is this: \"Allow Callouts,\" \"Places & Landmarks,\" \"Mobility,\" \"Safety,\" \"Intersections,\" \"Distance to Audio Beacon,\" and \"Repeat Callouts.\"\n\nYep, that sounds right to me.\n\n" ],

The Connector Client just calls this the Confluence URL: https://github.com/elastic/connectors/blame/2f7a7477e76ad52102ddb43399d0707ad6351f46/connectors/sources/confluence.py#L512-L515\n\n\n### To Reproduce\n1. Create a native Confluence Connector\n2. Wonder WTF is a \"Confluence URL Label\"?\n\n## Expected behavior\n- The label shouldn't have the word \"Label\"\n- both the native and client options should have a tooltip to tell you what this should be\n\n\n## Environment\n8.16, 8.17, 8.18, 9.x\n\n\n\ncame up during https://github.com/elastic/search-team/issues/9101",

Since we already have the helper function `naive_utc_now()` available in `api/libs/datetime_utils.py`, we should update all such usages to use this helper for consistency and simplicity. This will make the codebase less error-prone and easier to maintain.\n\n\n### 2. Additional context or comments\n\nNo additional context.

I am using the description field on the actions in order to let everyone know what each action is actually doing. And I use descriptions in the Event section to describe what's happening there. But it would be VERY helpful to have descriptions as optional all throughout Companion especially for Triggers and Buttons themselves. A place for a one-sentence explanation of what a button or trigger is doing.\n\n### Usecases\n\nExplaining clearly what a button or trigger is going to do / is doing. So a secondary user or someone who didn't make the button or trigger can understand what is happening.",

Each transformation function returns a pandas.Series:\n\n\n\nWhen I run this code with scikit-learn 1.6, I get the following error:\n\nAfter investigation, I found that the issue occurs because each transformer returns a Series, not a DataFrame. If I update the functions to return DataFrame objects instead, the error disappears.\n\nInterestingly, in scikit-learn 1.4, the same code works correctly even when the functions return Series.\n\n\nDo you have any explanation for why this changed between version 1.4 and 1.6 ?\n\nThanks in advance for your help!\n\n### Steps/Code to Reproduce\n\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import FunctionTransformer, FeatureUnion\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef compute_cumulative_mean_age(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:\n    return (\n        df[\"age\"]\n        .astype(float)\n        .groupby(df[\"id\"])\n        .expanding()\n        .mean()\n        .droplevel(level=\"id\")\n        .reindex(df.index)\n        .rename(\"cumulative_mean_age\")\n    )\n\ndef compute_cumulative_mean_weight(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:\n    return (\n        df[\"poids\"]\n        .astype(float)\n        .groupby(df[\"id\"])\n        .expanding()\n        .mean()\n        .droplevel(level=\"id\")\n        .reindex(df.index)\n        .rename(\"cumulative_mean_weight\")\n    )\n\ndef compute_features(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:\n    feature_union = FeatureUnion(\n        [\n            (\"cumulative_mean_age\", FunctionTransformer(compute_cumulative_mean_age)),\n            (\"cumulative_mean_weight\", FunctionTransformer(compute_cumulative_mean_weight))\n        ]\n    ).set_output(transform=\"pandas\")\n\n    return feature_union.fit_transform(X=df).astype(float)\n\ndef transform(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:\n    return compute_features(df)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    np.random.seed(42)\n    df = pd.DataFrame({\n        'id': [1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8],\n        'age': np.random.randint(18, 70, size=10),\n        'poids': np.random.randint(50, 100, size=10)\n    })\n\n    print(transform(df))\n```\n\n### Expected Results\n\n```pytb\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"C:\\Users\\XXX\\PycharmProjects\\fraude_detection_pec_audio\\tmp.py\", line 73, in <module>\n    print(transform(df=df))\n          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"C:\\Users\\XXX\\PycharmProjects\\fraude_detection_pec_audio\\tmp.py\", line 55, in transform\n    return compute_features(\n           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"C:\\Users\\XXX\\PycharmProjects\\fraude_detection_pec_audio\\tmp.py\", line 45, in compute_features\n    .fit_transform(\n     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"C:\\Users\\XXX\\PycharmProjects\\fraude_detection_pec_audio\\.venv\\Lib\\site-packages\\sklearn\\utils\\_set_output.py\", line 332, in wrapped\n    return _wrap_data_with_container(method, data_to_wrap, X, self)\n           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"C:\\Users\\XXX\\PycharmProjects\\fraude_detection_pec_audio\\.venv\\Lib\\site-packages\\sklearn\\utils\\_set_output.py\", line 307, in _wrap_data_with_container\n    return adapter.create_container(\n           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"C:\\Users\\XXX\\PycharmProjects\\fraude_detection_pec_audio\\.venv\\Lib\\site-packages\\sklearn\\utils\\_set_output.py\", line 135, in create_container\n    X_output = _create_pandas_dataframe_from_non_pandas_container(\n               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"C:\\Users\\XXX\\PycharmProjects\\fraude_detection_pec_audio\\.venv\\Lib\\site-packages\\sklearn\\utils\\fixes.py\", line 428, in _create_pandas_dataframe_from_non_pandas_container\n    return pd.DataFrame(X, index=index, copy=copy)\n           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"C:\\Users\\XXX\\PycharmProjects\\fraude_detection_pec_audio\\.venv\\Lib\\site-packages\\pandas\\core\\frame.py\", line 722, in __init__\n    mgr = ndarray_to_mgr(\n          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"C:\\Users\\XXX\\PycharmProjects\\fraude_detection_pec_audio\\.venv\\Lib\\site-packages\\pandas\\core\\internals\\construction.py\", line 349, in ndarray_to_mgr\n    _check_values_indices_shape_match(values, index, columns)\n  File \"C:\\Users\\XXX\\PycharmProjects\\fraude_detection_pec_audio\\.venv\\Lib\\site-packages\\pandas\\core\\internals\\construction.py\", line 420, in _check_values_indices_shape_match\n    raise ValueError(f\"Shape of passed values is {passed}, indices imply {implied}\")\nValueError: Shape of passed values is (20, 1), indices imply (10, 1)\n```\n\n### Actual Results\n\n```pytb\n    raise ValueError(f\"Shape of passed values is {passed}, indices imply {implied}\")\nValueError: Shape of passed values is (20, 1), indices imply (10, 1)\n```\n\n### Versions\n\n```shell\nsklearn: 1.6.0\nnumpy: 1.26.4\npandas: 1.5.3\n```",

'major', 'minor', 'patch', 'unchanged'/'null', etc.). With this feature, users can parse how the current version was bumped from the previous for use in changelogs or CI pipelines and other tools. This can currently be inferred by parsing the version keys at the top level and within the 'previous' key in the context json object, however having the functionality built-in would make it much easier to do this kind of work.\n\nSplit out from conversation regarding #1091.\n\n### Desired solution\n\nA 'version-change-type' key next to 'version' whose value can indicate any of the possible semver types git-cliff can bump between (I believe this excludes pre-releases? ex. rc/dev/beta/alpha?):\n- 'major'\n- 'minor'\n- 'patch'\n\nThe value can be `null` in the case that there was no change available between the current and previous version (first/default version or unable to automatically bump, for example: no conventional commit history, etc.).\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n- `--bumped-type` cli argument to output the bumped version type\n- Only including 'version-change-type' key when using --bump (this is the most likely use case for this feature, but it reduces information available in the context for previous versions, so it might just make more sense to include a 'version-change-type' value in the context for any version that follows a previous version)\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

The app incorrectly reports \"Tailscale is not installed\" when tailscaled is present and operational.\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n### Tailscale Variants on macOS\n1. **Tailscale GUI App** - App Store version (detected)\n2. **Tailscale CLI** - Standalone CLI version\n3. **tailscaled** - Open source daemon (not detected)\n\n### Current Detection Logic\n- Only checks for GUI app or standard CLI locations\n- Doesn't check for tailscaled daemon\n- Missing detection of systemd/launchd services\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### Phase 1: Enhanced Tailscale Detection\n\n#### 1.1 Update Tailscale Detection Service\n**File**: `mac/VibeTunnel/Core/Services/TailscaleService.swift`\n\n```swift\nimport Foundation\nimport Network\n\nclass TailscaleService {\n    enum TailscaleVariant {\n        case gui           // App Store version\n        case cli           // Standalone CLI\n        case daemon        // tailscaled daemon\n        case notInstalled\n    }\n    \n    struct TailscaleInfo {\n        let variant: TailscaleVariant\n        let version: String?\n        let binaryPath: String?\n        let socketPath: String?\n        let isRunning: Bool\n    }\n    \n    // MARK: - Detection Methods\n    \n    func detectTailscale() -> TailscaleInfo {\n        // Check multiple detection methods in priority order\n        \n        // 1.

If you open a pcap file in Wireshark and edit pcapng-only metadata fields, Wireshark will not save the metadata and will not warn you about the loss of data. This doesn't apply directly to us (since we emit pcapng files with the wrong file extension), but illustrates a meaningful UX difference between the file formats.\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nThe on-device rayhunter API should use the file extension `.pcapng` to accurately reflect the file format in use.\n\n### Alternatives Considered\n\n_No response_",

      "description" : "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\nWhen I initially opened Mbin on mobile (fedia) I knew my first stop was to subscribe to a bunch of communities so my feed comes to life with interesting stuff.\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/023f234c-20ac-4df1-a191-c308af1b3aae\n\n1. Clicking on search I was hoping that I would see at the top of the results a name match result for the \"Montreal\" community\n2. I realized that the term \"Magazine\" means community after clicking on it and looking at the list\n3. Went to search and typed in the name of a city to try to find that the community I know I've seen on Lemmy but the community didn't open.\n4. Searched for a string to open the community, realized there must be some over way to search for the community at this point but figured this would work\n5. The community opens and then I went on a hunt for a subscribe button, finding it in the menu on the side\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nThere are a few ways to handle this, seems like anything helps\n- [ ] (1) An exact string match for a community (less the domain) seems like it could show a \"Community Results\" box that show \"Communities matching your result\". It would contain one or two results and have a \"view more\" link at the bottom if people are in serious onboarding mode and looking to add a lot of related communities \"montreal_food\" and \"montreal_housing\" etc.\n- [ ] (2) The term Magazine has become confusing, especially now that we are federated and viewing /c/ urls for Communities in Lemmy and PieFed. It's easy to get overwhelmed/confused with fediverse software and that step of \"Oh, this is a community... I think... maybe it's a superset, maybe it's a subset, OK note to self this is probably a community\" I'm not seeing the benefit, I can definitely see and have experienced the barrier.\n- [ ] (3) The autocomplete for this is excellent, but I was hoping if a community was selected and the text field above left blank that the \"Community Result\" search box would show up with the community to \"go to the community\"\n- [ ] (4) Maybe allowing a blank search term just shows the latest posts for the community, or goes to the community if it has been selected?\n- [ ] (5) I would suggest a very compact community header that has the name, logo/background image and a subscribe/unsubscribe button and a button to \"expand\" it to show everything. It's hard to know that you are actually on a community and I really only found that I could subscribe by chance. Under the hamburger menu I just don't expect to find elements related to inline content. That's where I expect to find search tools, DMs, profile settings perhaps.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nDetailed above.\n\n** Additional Context **\nI'm a brand new user to Mbin who users Lemmy, Reddit and Piefed so I though I would just note the pain points I hit before I learn the software and stop seeing them. Hope this is helpful and not too annoying.",

      "comments" : [ "Hi there, sadly mbin has 2 different searches: one for magazines (communities) and one for everything else. Being on mobile the magazine search is not that easy to find, as the header links are hidden in the menu (what you called \"hamburger menu\"), but on desktop you'll see this: \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6dd3f84a-59c8-4031-bf71-0b20648279e0)\n\nThe box that you filled in is an additional filter for the search term, not intended to work on its own. But maybe it should be.\n\nThe magazine panel is only hidden in the menu on mobil, on desktop it looks something like this: \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8b92cc7-28ac-44cb-84ad-70fec82ed8b9)\n\nAnd the indicator that you are in a magazine gets hidden on mobile...\n\nSo things to fix this issue in my opinion:\n- [x] Add an indicator on mobile that you are inside of a magazine. Preferably use the one already in the header and do not hide it on mobile\n- [x] Add magazines to the results of the \"normal\" search", "The search enhancements are taken care of by #1670, the indicator gets added in #1671", "Thanks for chipping away at this, I'll get a friend to try onboarding when the next release is out and see if they snag on anything." ],

The number is -> **reconnection attempts + 1**, but expected to be -> _reconnection attempts_. \r\n\r\n_Details._\r\n\r\nsource: `HubConnection.ts`\r\nmethod: `private async _reconnect(error?: Error)`\r\n\r\nProblematic code-snippet `_reconnect()` loop source:\r\n``` \r\nwhile (nextRetryDelay !== null) {\r\n    this._logger.log(LogLevel.Information, `Reconnect attempt number ${previousReconnectAttempts} will start in ${nextRetryDelay} ms.`);\r\n\r\n    //...\r\n\r\n    try {\r\n        await this._startInternal();\r\n\r\n        // ...\r\n\r\n        return;\r\n    } catch (e) {\r\n        this._logger.log(LogLevel.Information, `Reconnect attempt failed because of error '${e}'.`);\r\n        // ... \r\n\r\n        retryError = e instanceof Error ? e : new Error(e.toString());\r\n        // ! source code line number 822, previousReconnectAttempts++\r\n        // increment, which finally influence on the incorrect log message (in case connection was not established).\r\n        nextRetryDelay = this._getNextRetryDelay(previousReconnectAttempts++, Date.now() - reconnectStartTime, retryError);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// ! source code line number 826\r\n// incorrect number of reconnection attempts logged.\r\nthis._logger.log(LogLevel.Information, `Reconnect retries have been exhausted after ${Date.now() - reconnectStartTime} ms and ${previousReconnectAttempts} failed attempts.

Create connection and start it.\r\n```\r\nconst hubConnection = new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder()\r\n    .withUrl(\"<connectionURL>\")\r\n    .withAutomaticReconnect()\r\n    .configureLogging(signalR.LogLevel.Information);\r\n\r\n\r\nhubConnection.start();\r\n```\r\n\r\n2.

High-Level Plan\n\n1. **Bundle the ESLint core** (already solved by `eslint-linter-browserify`)\n2. **Bundle `eslint-plugin-react` for browser use**\n3. **Patch any Node-only APIs**\n4. **Register the plugin dynamically**\n5. **Package it into a single browser-compatible script (UMD or ES module)**\n\n---\n\n### \uD83E\uDDF0 Step-by-Step Guide\n\n#### 1. **Install dependencies**\n\n```bash\nnpm install eslint-linter-browserify eslint-plugin-react browserify\n```\n\nOptionally, for smaller builds:\n\n```bash\nnpm install rollup rollup-plugin-node-resolve rollup-plugin-commonjs\n```\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Write a plugin wrapper (for browser context)**\n\nCreate a file `registerReactPlugin.js`:\n\n```js\nimport { Linter } from \"eslint-linter-browserify\";\nimport reactPlugin from \"eslint-plugin-react\";\n\n// Register the plugin manually\nconst linter = new Linter();\nlinter.defineRules(reactPlugin.rules);\nlinter.defineParser(\"espree\", require(\"espree\")); // if needed\n\n// Optionally expose\nwindow.reactLinter = linter;\n```\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Patch browser-incompatible dependencies**\n\nSome dependencies in `eslint-plugin-react` (like `resolve`, `fs`, or `module`) may not work in the browser.\n\nYou can handle this by:\n\n* **Shimming them** in your bundler config (Browserify or Rollup)\n* Or using [`[rollup-plugin-node-polyfills](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup-plugin-node-polyfills)`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup-plugin-node-polyfills)\n\n---\n\n#### 4. **Bundle with Browserify or Rollup**\n\n**Using Browserify**:\n\n```bash\nbrowserify registerReactPlugin.js -o react-plugin-linter.js\n```\n\n**Using Rollup (better tree-shaking)**:\n\n```js\n// rollup.config.js\nimport resolve from \"@rollup/plugin-node-resolve\";\nimport commonjs from \"@rollup/plugin-commonjs\";\nimport polyfills from \"rollup-plugin-node-polyfills\";\n\nexport default {\n  input: \"registerReactPlugin.js\",\n  output: {\n    file: \"react-plugin-linter.js\",\n    format: \"iife\",\n    name: \"reactLinterBundle\"\n  },\n  plugins: [polyfills(), resolve(), commonjs()],\n};\n```\n\nThen:\n\n```bash\nnpx rollup -c\n```\n\n---\n\n#### 5. **Use it in HTML**\n\n```html\n<script src=\"eslint-linter-browserify.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"react-plugin-linter.js\"></script>\n<script>\n  const messages = window.reactLinter.verify(\n    \"const Hello = () => <div>Hello</div>\",\n    {\n      parserOptions: {\n        ecmaVersion: 2020,\n        sourceType: \"module\",\n        ecmaFeatures: { jsx: true }\n      },\n      rules: {\n        \"react/jsx-uses-react\": \"error\",\n        \"react/jsx-uses-vars\": \"error\"\n      }\n    }\n  );\n  console.log(messages);\n</script>\n```\n\n---\n\n### ?????? Caveats\n\n* `eslint-plugin-react` relies on module resolution (`require.resolve`) to find components???it may need to be patched or stubbed.\n* Avoid rules that rely on the filesystem (like `react/display-name` that may resolve filenames).\n* Size will be large???consider tree-shaking or manually including only desired rules.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to generate a working starter repo or a minimal HTML demo with this setup?", "Could be similar job to this:\n\nhttps://github.com/vizhub-core/sharedb-client-browser/tree/main" ],

      "description" : "### Custom Node Testing\n\n- [x] I have tried disabling custom nodes and the issue persists (see [how to disable custom nodes](https://docs.comfy.org/troubleshooting/custom-node-issues#step-1%3A-test-with-all-custom-nodes-disabled) if you need help)\n\n### Frontend Version\n\n1.24.1 (latest)\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWhen typing an opening square bracket `[` in the node search box, the search should either:\n- Escape the special character properly in the regex\n- Continue to work without throwing an error\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nWhen typing `[` in the node search box popover component, the application throws a JavaScript error and the search functionality breaks.\n\nError: \n```\nvue.esm-browser.prod.js:5 SyntaxError: Invalid regular expression: /([)/gi: Unterminated character class (at formatUtil.ts:42:17)\n    at new RegExp (<anonymous>)\n    at highlightQuery (formatUtil.ts:42:17)\n    at Proxy.<anonymous> (NodeSearchItem.vue:81:15)\n```\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Open ComfyUI frontend\n2. Right-click on the canvas to open the node search box\n3. Type `[` (opening square bracket) in the search input\n4. Observe the JavaScript error in the browser console\n\n### Debug Logs\n\nN/A - Frontend only issue\n\n### Browser Logs\n\n```\nvue.esm-browser.prod.js:5 SyntaxError: Invalid regular expression: /([)/gi: Unterminated character class (at formatUtil.ts:42:17)\n    at new RegExp (<anonymous>)\n    at highlightQuery (formatUtil.ts:42:17)\n    at Proxy.<anonymous> (NodeSearchItem.vue:81:15)\n    at iJ (vue.esm-browser.prod.js:5:63907)\n    at ek.a [as fn] (vue.esm-browser.prod.js:5:53813)\n    at ek.run (vue.esm-browser.prod.js:5:7130)\n    at H (vue.esm-browser.prod.js:5:54179)\n    at U (vue.esm-browser.prod.js:5:52411)\n    at V (vue.esm-browser.prod.js:5:52226)\n    at x (vue.esm-browser.prod.js:5:49179)\n```\n\n### Setting JSON\n\nDefault settings (issue occurs with fresh installation)\n\n### What browsers do you use to access the UI ?\n\nGoogle Chrome, Mozilla Firefox\n\n### Other Information\n\nThe issue is in `src/utils/formatUtil.ts` at line 42 in the `highlightQuery` function:\n\n```typescript\nexport function highlightQuery(text: string, query: string) {\n  if (\\!query) return text\n  const regex = new RegExp(`(${query})`, 'gi')  // This line fails when query contains special regex characters\n  return text.replace(regex, '<span class=\"highlight\">$1</span>')\n}\n```\n\nThe function needs to escape special regex characters in the query string before creating the RegExp. Other special characters like `]`, `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `*`, `+`, `?`, `.`, `^`, `$`, ` < /dev/null | `, and `\\\\` would likely cause similar issues.\n\nThis might be related to FuseJS smart search syntax features being enabled, but the root cause is that the `highlightQuery` function doesn't escape regex special characters.\n\n???Issue is synchronized with this [Notion page](https://www.notion.so/Issue-4466-Bug-Typing-opening-square-bracket-in-node-search-box-causes-regex-error-2336d73d365081b5b6c8c5d575a3835a) by [Unito](https://www.unito.io)\n",

I don't know how to have it not do that. \n\n _Originally posted by @davidhutchens in [#2224](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution/issues/2224#issuecomment-2853023419)_\n\n`gradle shadowJar` overwrites the JAR created by the `gradle jar` task. \n\n```\n$ ./gradlew jar\n\nBUILD SUCCESSFUL in 3s\n5 actionable tasks: 5 executed\n$ ls -al build/libs\ntotal 47112\ndrwxr-xr-x@ 3 maehne  staff        96  7 Mai 14:57 .\ndrwxr-xr-x@ 7 maehne  staff       224  7 Mai 14:57 ..\n-rw-r--r--@ 1 maehne  staff  23578519  7 Mai 14:57 logisim-evolution-4.0.0-dev.jar\n$ ./gradlew shadowJar\n\nBUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1s\n5 actionable tasks: 3 executed, 2 up-to-date\n$ ls -al build/libs\ntotal 59480\ndrwxr-xr-x@ 4 maehne  staff       128  7 Mai 14:58 .\ndrwxr-xr-x@ 7 maehne  staff       224  7 Mai 14:57 ..\n-rw-r--r--@ 1 maehne  staff       261  7 Mai 14:58 logisim-evolution-4.0.0-dev.jar\n-rw-r--r--@ 1 maehne  staff  29417523  7 Mai 14:58 logisim-evolution-4.0.0dev-all.jar\n```\n\nAfter `./gradlew shadowJar`, `build/libs/logisim-evolution-4.0.0-dev.jar` only contains an empty `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` file.\n\nThe original JAR file created by `./gradlew jar` is lacking a `Main-Class: com.cburch.logisim.Main` entry, so cannot be directly executed using `java -jar build/libs/logisim-evolution-4.0.0-dev.jar`.\n\nIt would be nice to find a way to either suppress the creation `build/libs/logisim-evolution-4.0.0-dev.jar` or keep it in an executable state.\n",

These tests need to run automatically on any computer building Skript.\n\n# How can I do this?\n\nIn practice, this is fairly simple. If my pull request adds or changes the functionality of syntax, I just need to create (or update) the corresponding Skript test file.\n\n**A lot of pull requests won't need any extra tests**. You'll only need to add/change a test file if you're adding/changing new functionality.\nThat said, if you think you can improve the existing test for a syntax element you are welcome to.\n\nFor example, if I change how `ExprDurability` works, I need to make sure that the `ExprDurability.sk` file is updated to test my changes.\n<img width=\"168\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript/assets/14147477/4bbfa141-8784-44b3-88c0-5cdfa764a7d8\">\n<img width=\"170\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript/assets/14147477/8ead7b8f-8b88-48cd-90e4-d763431659df\">\n\n(If you add a new syntax you will need to create a new test file for it.)",

What do you think about requiring tests to start with (or just be) the name of the expression. For example, the name of the test for ExprBlockData would just be ExprBlockData. Some files have multiple tests, so in those cases we could use \"ExprBlockData - <context>\" to differentiate the test names. We may also want to consider whether having multiple tests in one file is practical compared to just \"sectioning\" tests using comments.", "> For example, the name of the test for ExprBlockData would just be ExprBlockData.\r\n\r\nThe base test is currently named after the syntax class (like `ExprBlockData` -> `block data`)\r\n\r\n> Some files have multiple tests, so in those cases we could use \"ExprBlockData - \" to differentiate the test names. \r\n\r\nThese are usually named `<class name> (<thing that requires its own test>)` so something like `block data (legacy)` or `block data (1.18+)` for example.\r\n\r\nI think this is fine since when the test fails that makes it fairly clear what's not working.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm more concerned about is the assertion messages - most testers have taken care to make all of the messages unique (so you can work out which one failed from the message) but ideally I'd like the testing system to be able to determine the line that was the cause of the failure so we don't have to rely on that.\r\n", "For clarity regarding this issue. Would the teams preference be for contributors to only open PRs into the dev/feature branch or is there a different branch preference? I dug through the contributing docs, but didn't see anything specific about the branching strategy, could have missed it though.\n\nEdit: Also do we have an updated list of remaining tests?

      "description" : "## Is your feature request related to a use case or problem? Please explain\n\nParameterization requires a bunch of boilerplate (`_is_parameterized_`, `_parameter_names_`, `_resolve_parameters_`, all of which just check / replace the specified member variables). It seems like something a decorator could handle well.\n\n## Describe the solution you would prefer\n\nIt'd be great if in #5985, the solution could just be \"add the decorator to `QasmUGate`\", something like \n\n```python\n@parameterizable(\"theta\", \"phi\", \"lmda\")\nclass QasmUGate(ops.Gate):\n```\n\n## How urgent is this for you? Is it blocking important work?\n\n<!-- Please choose one of the following options and remove the others -->\n**P3** ??? I'm not really blocked by it; it's an idea I'm proposing based on principle\n\n## Process Note\n\nFor anyone wanting to take this issue, it's probably worth a mini [RFC](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/main/docs/dev/rfc_process.md) and finding a maintainer (not me) to sponsor it before starting work (assuming this even gets to triage/accepted state). While it's probably below the \"RFC Required\" bar, I think there are enough variables, that having an approved design would be beneficial. (Some things that come to mind: What happens if only some fields are parameterizable? Can/should it work both with dataclasses and with non-dataclasses? Can the implementations be overridden in classes it's applied to? How to apply it in gate class hierarchies (e.g. at the EigenGate level or at each subtype?) Does it interact with mypy typing in any way or are type declarations independent? What's the best way to test it? Is it worth going back and retrofitting existing gates into this model?)",

The dependency graph is built on a Gateway <- HTTPRoute -> InferencePool relationship. The code examines ParentRefs whose kind is Gateway, ignoring ParentRefs of kind [ListenerSet](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/geps/gep-1713/). In an HTTPRoute (v1.3.0), you can do:\n\n```yaml\nspec:\n  parentRefs:\n  - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io\n    kind: ListenerSet\n    name: my-listenerset\n```\n\nand then the ListenerSet itself carries a list of Gateway parents (in its spec.gateways field). We will need to extend the plugin's InferencePool status management to support ListenerSet ParentRefs.\n\n",

How many nodes of the point tree we are visiting, how many leaves we are reading etc. This should help us understand if/when there are regressions.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n- Enable debug logging\n- Enable more logs by adding them to `AbstractProfiler` so that we can profile the results \n\n### Related component\n\nSearch:Performance\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

How do you aim to achieve this?\n\nUse optional dependencies, so that only needed packages are installed.\n\nAnd replace original command with:\n\n```sh\npip install traceloop-sdk[full]\n```\n\nSomething like that.

There are also situations where capturing enemy units would be a lot more viable if your own units would immediately stop firing at the unit that has been queued for capture. \n\n### What area of the game does this feature request pertain?\n\nGameplay\n\n### Other (optional)\n\nIt is very important to not end up with a \"poisoned state\" where an enemy unit is marked for capture but is not actually in a capture queue. One way to solve this is to keep track which unit has the capture-marked unit in its queue and then each time the capture-marked unit would be targeted, ensure that the unit attempting to capture it is indeed still trying to capture it. Of course, with giving commanders to teammates and with decoy commanders being able to capture, this would have to be a list of capturers. \r\n\r\nAlso, this probably shouldn't propogate through to teammates because of easy trolling.

These are estimators with no `get_test_params` implemented, or `get_test_params` returning only a single dictionary instead of a list of two (or more) dictionaries.\n2. post here in this issue which estimator you picked (to avoid duplication of work)\n3. come up with a parameter set satisfying the above constraints and add it to the return (should be list of two or more dictionaries)\n4. make a PR, this should add the parameter set in `get_test_params`, and remove the estimator from `EXCLUDED_TESTS_BY_TEST` in `sktime.tests._config`\n\nAn example PR that adds second parameter sets for some estimators can be found here: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/3428\n\nFinding some estimators that have only one parameter set can be done quickly by checking the variable `EXCLUDED_TESTS_BY_TEST` in `sktime.tests._config`, estimators which do not comply with the \"number of test parameter sets\" requirements are skipping `\"test_get_test_params_coverage\"`.\n\nAlternatively, locally running code which does this:\n```python\nfrom sktime.registry import all_estimators\n\nall_ests = all_estimators()\n[x[0] for x in all_ests if (len(x[1].get_test_params())<2 or isinstance(x[1].get_test_params(), dict)) and len(x[1].get_param_names())>0]\n```\n\nCurrent output:\n- [x] `Aggregator`\n- [x] `BaggingForecaster`\n- [x] `CNNNetwork`\n- [ ] `ClaSPTransformer`\n- [ ] `ColumnEnsembleClassifier`\n- [ ] `ColumnTransformer`\n- [ ] `ColumnwiseTransformer`\n- [x] `ComposableTimeSeriesForestRegressor`\n- [x] `ConstraintViolation`\n- [x] `CutoffSplitter`\n- [ ] `DOBIN`\n- [ ] `DWTTransformer`\n- [ ] `DistFromAligner`\n- [ ] `DistanceFeatures`\n- [ ] `DontUpdate`\n- [ ] `DummyRegressor`\n- [x] `EmpiricalCoverage`\n- [x] `ExpandingWindowSplitter`\n- [x] `FCNNetwork`\n- [ ] `FeatureSelection`\n- [x] `Filter`\n- [x] `FinancialHolidaysTransformer`\n- [x] `FittedParamExtractor`\n- [ ] `GeometricMeanAbsoluteError`\n- [ ] `GeometricMeanRelativeAbsoluteError`\n- [ ] `GreedyGaussianSegmentation`\n- [x] `HCrystalBallAdapter`\n- [x] `HOG1DTransformer`\n- [x] `HampelFilter`\n- [x] `HolidayFeatures`\n- [ ] `InceptionTimeNetwork`\n- [ ] `IndividualBOSS`\n- [ ] `IndividualTDE`\n- [x] `KNeighborsTimeSeriesRegressor`\n- [x] `KalmanFilterTransformerFP`\n- [x] `KalmanFilterTransformerPK`\n- [x] `LSTMFCNNetwork`\n- [ ] `LogTransformer`\n- [x] `MACNNNetwork`\n- [ ] `MCDCNNClassifier`\n- [ ] `MCDCNNNetwork`\n- [ ] `MCDCNNRegressor`\n- [ ] `MLPNetwork`\n- [ ] `MatrixProfile`\n- [x] `MatrixProfileClassifier`\n- [ ] `MatrixProfileTransformer`\n- [ ] `MeanAbsoluteError`\n- [ ] `MeanRelativeAbsoluteError`\n- [ ] `MedianAbsoluteError`\n- [ ] `MedianRelativeAbsoluteError`\n- [x] `MiniRocket`\n- [ ] `MiniRocketMultivariate`\n- [ ] `MiniRocketMultivariateVariable`\n- [ ] `MultiRocket`\n- [ ] `MultiRocketMultivariate`\n- [ ] `OnlineEnsembleForecaster`\n- [ ] `PAA`\n- [ ] `PCATransformer`\n- [x] `PaddingTransformer`\n- [x] `ParamFitterPipeline`\n- [ ] `PlateauFinder`\n- [x] `PluginParamsForecaster`\n- [x] `PoissonHMM`\n- [x] `PyODAnnotator`\n- [x] `RNNNetwork`\n- [ ] `RandomIntervalFeatureExtractor`\n- [ ] `RandomIntervalSegmenter`\n- [ ] `RandomIntervals`\n- [ ] `RandomSamplesAugmenter`\n- [ ] `ReducerTransform`\n- [x] `ResNetNetwork`\n- [x] `Rocket`\n- [x] `RocketClassifier`\n- [x] `RocketRegressor`\n- [x] `STRAY`\n- [x] `ShapeDTW`\n- [ ] `ShapeletTransform`\n- [x] `SingleWindowSplitter`\n- [ ] `SlidingWindowSegmenter`\n- [x] `SlidingWindowSplitter`\n- [ ] `SlopeTransformer`\n- [ ] `StackingForecaster`\n- [ ] `SupervisedTimeSeriesForest`\n- [x] `TSInterpolator`\n- [ ] `TapNetNetwork`\n- [x] `TestPlusTrainSplitter`\n- [x] `ThetaLinesTransformer`\n- [x] `ThetaModularForecaster`\n- [ ] `TimeBinner`\n- [x] `TimeSeriesForestClassifier`\n- [x] `TimeSeriesForestRegressor`\n- [x] `TimeSeriesKMeansTslearn`\n- [x] `TimeSeriesLloyds`\n- [ ] `TruncationTransformer`\n- [ ] `UnobservedComponents`\n- [ ] `WhiteNoiseAugmenter`\n- [x] `YtoX`",

Just add bindings to these exact options instead of struggling with selection.\nAdd binding for \"Copy input\" and for \"Clear input\" if not present. \n\nNow when it comes to copying stuff, I feel the issue is wider than just the input. It would be useful to have a dedicated in chat command that can also copy any previous message by either the id (would be nice to be able to use negative ids to go from the last) or/and display a small tag next to each message with its ID (number) that allows to do `/copy #123` . \nIf there's no such feature planned or worked on yet, then it would be useful.

Move to beginning of line\n> \n> **Ctrl + E** ??? Move to end of line\n> \n> **Ctrl + U** ??? Delete from cursor to start of line\n> \n> **Ctrl + K** ??? Delete from cursor to end of line\n> \n> **Ctrl + W** ??? Delete the word before cursor\n> \n> **Ctrl + Y** ??? Yank (paste) what you just cut with `Ctrl+U/K/W`\n> \n> **Ctrl + L** ??? Clear screen (same as `clear`)\n> \n> **Ctrl + C** ??? Send SIGINT to stop current command/process\n> \n> **Ctrl + Z** ??? Send SIGTSTP to suspend current process to background\n> \n> **Ctrl + R** ??? Reverse search through command history\n> \n> **Ctrl + D** ??? Log out of terminal (or send EOF)\n> \n> **Ctrl + T** ??? Transpose (swap) two characters around cursor\n> \n> **Ctrl + \\_** ??? Undo (only one level in Bash)\n> \n> **Alt + B** ??? Move back one word\n> \n> **Alt + F** ??? Move forward one word\n> \n> **Alt + D** ??? Delete word after cursor\n> \n> **Alt + .** ??? Insert last argument of previous command\n> \n> **Alt + U** ??? Uppercase word from cursor\n> \n> **Alt + L** ??? Lowercase word from cursor\n> \n> **Alt + T** ??? Transpose words\n> \n> ---\n> \n> ## \uD83D\uDDA5??? **Terminator-specific shortcuts**\n> \n> Terminator binds some `Ctrl + Shift` combos instead of plain `Ctrl`, to avoid clashing with Bash.\n> \n> **Ctrl + Shift + T** ??? Open new tab\n> \n> **Ctrl + Shift + N** ??? Open new window\n> \n> **Ctrl + Shift + O** ??? Split terminal horizontally\n> \n> **Ctrl + Shift + E** ??? Split terminal vertically\n> \n> **Ctrl + Shift + W** ??? Close current terminal pane\n> \n> **Ctrl + Shift + Q** ??? Quit Terminator\n> \n> **Alt + Arrow Key** ??? Move focus between split panes\n> \n> **Ctrl + Shift + ??? / ??? / ??? / ???** ??? Resize split panes\n> \n> \n> ---\n> \n> ## ?????? **GNOME terminal conventions**\n> \n> GNOME doesn???t hijack your terminal keys much, but system-level shortcuts can interfere:\n> \n> * **Alt + F2** ??? Opens GNOME run dialog (outside the terminal)\n> \n> * **Alt + Tab** ??? Window switcher (global)\n> \n> ---\n> \n> ## \uD83E\uDDE9 **X11 note**\n> \n> On X11, `Alt` is handled as `Meta` ??? so these should Just Work unless you remap keys or the window manager grabs them. Mutter generally won???t override typical Bash `Alt` shortcuts inside the terminal.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> ## ??? **One hidden gotcha**\n> \n> If you???re using `terminator` inside GNOME with `gdm3` and Mutter, remember that `Alt` shortcuts sometimes get grabbed by the window manager. If a shortcut isn???t working, it???s usually the window manager, not Bash.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> ### **TL;DR**\n> \n> **`Ctrl` = line editing and control.**\n> \n> **`Alt` = word-level editing and argument reuse.**\n> \n> **`Ctrl + Shift` = terminal pane/tab management in `terminator`.**\n> \n> ---\n> " ],

However, we are considering to implement an improved implementation of `showModal` method where the additional logic needed to pass context to shwonModally will be automated. Currently, you would need to attach to the 'shownModally' event on the **frame** as the frame is the view (1st parameter) passed in `showModal` method. \r\n\r\n**Feature request:** Loggin this one as a feature to simplify the logic behind `showModal` method\r\n\r\n**Current state**\r\nFor example, here is how you could pass the context from `home-page` (the host) to the `modal-page` (the modal)\r\n\r\n`home-page.ts`\r\n```TS\r\nconst frame = new Frame();\r\n\r\nframe.on(\"shownModally\", (args: ShownModallyData) => {\r\n    frame.navigate({ \r\n        moduleName: \"modal/modal-page\", \r\n        context: args.context // passing the context from showModal\r\n    });\r\n})\r\n\r\nlet contextToPass = \"Context passed from home-page\";\r\npage.showModal(frame, contextToPass,\r\n    (receivedContext) => {\r\n        console.log(\"home-page modal frame closed\");\r\n        console.log(\"[home-page] Received context from closeModal callback: \", receivedContext);\r\n    }, true);\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then in the modal you could access the context with `navigatedTo` event in  `modal-page.ts`\r\n```TS\r\nimport { Page, NavigatedData } from \"tns-core-modules/ui/page\";\r\nimport { View, EventData } from \"tns-core-modules/ui/core/view\";\r\n\r\nexport function onTap(args: EventData) {\r\n    const view = args.object as View;\r\n    const page = view.page as Page;\r\n    page.frame.navigate({ \r\n        moduleName: \"modal-second/modal-second-page\", \r\n        context: \"Context passed from modal-page (1)\"\r\n    });\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport function onNavigatedTo(args: NavigatedData) {\r\n    console.log(\"[modal-page] Received context: \", args.context);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n `modal-page.xml`\r\n```XML\r\n<Page backgroundColor=\"green\" navigatedTo=\"onNavigatedTo\">\r\n    <ActionBar>\r\n        <Label text=\"Modal\"></Label>\r\n    </ActionBar>\r\n    <StackLayout backgroundColor=\"lightGreen\">\r\n        <Button text=\"Navigate To Second Page\" tap=\"onTap\" />\r\n    </StackLayout>\r\n</Page>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above scenario will be implemented in the demo app via [this PR](https://github.com/NativeScript/modal-navigation-demo/pull/5)", "Hi i'm interested in working on this issue", "> Hi i'm interested in working on this issue\n\nBy all means.

Rather than building it into the AMCL node directly, I think this makes sense as a separate node that can spawn on bringup and once it has the initial pose set and accepted, it can exit. That way its a nice modular utility (that maybe its pattern can be repeated in the future for other similar state-persisting variables).\n\nWe could create a node that takes as a parameter the file directory to persist state data information within. Then, we subscribe to the AMCL pose topic and dump it to that file periodically. On startup, if the file is detected, we take its value and send it over to AMCL's set pose topic (so we have ACK that it was accepted). \n\nAnother param could be whether to only dump the pose to file, set the pose on startup, or both to run the gambit of use-cases. \n\nIf this is designed well, this could be abstract of AMCL set-pose specifically and could be later applied to other topics state variables that should be persisted in some applications. \n\nIt is sufficiently abstract and we find utility in other applications than AMCL, we could make a new package out of it even :-)", "Hello @SteveMacenski and @techtasie , I would like to help.", "@Vedant87 Great!

I think the `BaseFootprintPublisher` in nav2_util could be moved over there as well as another good common-place utility. \n\nCan you we brain storm a few other tools that might be nice to have included in this toolkit that we're missing? It would be nice to introduce this with a small handful of things to start off with. ", "Yes , automatic setting initial pose is a param. but wouldn't it conflict if this param is default on and it could happen that it loads a pose from a previous session of simulation? for this i think it'll be better if kept default off, and if navigation happens to crash , or a need to relocalize the robot on startup, we just can relaunch the node with this param set to true and if we dont wish to relaunch the node again, the services can anytime be used for relocalisation.\n\n I???d love to help seed a new nav2_toolkit package with this and a few other small utility nodes. I agree that the BaseFootprintPublisher would be a great fit there too.To get started with i think we can have \n\n\n- System Resource monitor: Tracks , logs and alerts for usage of system resources relevant to robot navigation performance. Would be useful to monitor performance on target devices.\n- Goal Repeater : This could be an extension to the pose restore , which would be a function which would track the goal progress and if theres a problem before \"Goal is Succeeded\" then can repeat the last goal after the recovery.\n- Map validator : A node which monitors the current map and checks for issues like All-zero maps,Corrupt or empty maps being loaded.\n- Benchmark Planners : given a map  and a goal , it would benchmark different Planners in nav2.\n\nNot sure about the feasibility of these ideas but if implemented i think they can be handy. \n\nMore Complex :\n\n- Map switcher : Basic idea is to switch maps for a robot which operates in a multi-level environment as it goes from one level to another.\n- Planner switcher : Switch global planner at runtime accessing certain conditions.", "@pranavk-2003 many of these things are already included in the core nav2 stack. The goal Repeater and Planer switcher are  already realized with the [behavior tree](https://docs.nav2.org/behavior_trees/overview/detailed_behavior_tree_walkthrough.html). The Map switcher is already a [service](https://github.com/ros-navigation/navigation2/blob/main/nav2_map_server/README.md#services) offered by the map server.\n\nI think the System Resource monitor is an issue that in my opinion should not be solved by ros2 nav2 but by your usual system monitoring tools. \n\nBut I really like the idea of a benchmarking tool. Especially when doing recordings for a paper, it is quite cumbersome to get performance metrics. Our current approach is to record rosbags and then run some Python scripts to analyse them after the fact. But maybe a simple node that records navigation performance metrics, like: average speed, recovery behaviour count, path driven vs. path planned, etc., would probably be quite useful.", "> Yes , automatic setting initial pose is a param. but wouldn't it conflict if this param is default on and it could happen that it loads a pose from a previous session of simulation? \n\nAh, yes, if we have this new node on by default, I agree with that. I guess I didn't imagine having this part of our default launch configuration, but if we do, I agree for simulation it would need to be off. But, that could be default on and we set the parameter in our nav2 yaml file to be off for the simulation case. \n\nIn that case, I think we should make a new nav2_bringup launch file for the toolkit so that we separate out the tools from the other system bringups so they're easy to enable / disable by a runtime launch parameter. I'm really liking this idea! \n\nAnother idea that I had that comes up reasonably often is a \"pause/resume\" behavior where you can pause (cancel) navigation and resume (send goal again) behavior. I've always recommended people implement this either in their BT XML (which is easy enough) or making a utility like this. It would be good to just have the utility available. \n\n> System Resource monitor\n\nYou may be able to strip that out of my `opennav_amd_demos` repository and add additional system metrics. I do tend to agree with @techtasie that this might not be a great Nav2 tool and there are some other ROS 2 utilities in the ecosystem that handle this. But, some other monitors might be nice if they're Nav2 or mobility specific metrics.  \n\n> Goal Repeater\n\nCan you clarify this one more? I'm not sure I understand. \n\n> Map validator\n\nI think the map server error codes / lifecycle handles this? \n\n> Benchmark Planners\n\nWe actually have that in `tools/` already for offline use. I don't think that should be in the toolkit since that's an offline testing utility, not runtime. \n\n> Planner switcher \n\nThe servers already handle this actually and there's BT nodes for it as well. I'm not sure there's much use for an additional utility \n\n> Map switcher\n\nThis would just be calling a service. I suppose we could expose a script that just takes in a new filepath to send to the service as a CLI command, but not much use for runtime deployed use, more debugging / lab use. \n", "> In that case, I think we should make a new nav2_bringup launch file for the toolkit so that we separate out the tools from the other system bringups so they're easy to enable / disable by a runtime launch parameter.

", "> Another idea that I had that comes up reasonably often is a \"pause/resume\" behavior where you can pause (cancel) navigation and resume (send goal again) behavior. I've always recommended people implement this either in their BT XML (which is easy enough) or making a utility like this. It would be good to just have the utility available.\n\nI was trying to implement this but cant get it working / cant decide which approach should be followed , i would appreciate a briefing about it.", "@pranavk-2003 can you talk a bit about what direction you've gone and what issues you ran into? :-) ", "I am not that familiar/used to working with advanced Nav2 and BT.So what i tried first is using services to get the pause resume behaviour to test the logic.(Didn't work) and i think because as its a action server,cant use a method i used in pose_persistent by subscribing the topics?still unsure.Then got started with having a BT and  still learning it, but feel lost.So if i could get a brief idea about the approach which shall be used , most preferred, i'll cope up.", "The action servers have \"hidden\" topics for the request, feedback, and response that the action client and server communicate. Actions are implemented in ROS 2 and not a type within DDS so its all done over topics that you can introspect. You can see this yourself if you use `ros2 topic list --include-hidden-topics`. So, you could potentially listen to this topic and store the last goal that's processing. When a response is sent, you can delete that as a completed non-pending goal. \n\nSo when you get a 'pause', you can use that goal to 'resume'. I'm actually not sure what the QoS settings for those action server hidden topics are by default. If they're transient local, then you could actually obtain the goal _when the pause service is called_ rather than always listening. \n\nSo then you would have to do something in the 'pause' service like:\n- Log the pause, with the goal info for debugging\n- Call the action server to cancel the current goal (and you should have the current goal info to do so)\n\nOn resume:\n- Log the resume with respective information \n- Call the action server with the original goal with updated timestamp.\n\nThen, you can create BT nodes to trigger those pause/resume actions. \n\n---\n\nSeparately, we could implement a pause / resume within the Behavior Tree itself.\n\nIn this case, we have a node that exposes a pause and resume service. When its in the paused state, then this node returns something that within the BT logic just skips doing anything. Else, it returns a value that lets the BT continue. \n\nWhen the BT paused state starts, we'd just need to cancel any running nodes -- and lucky for us that all of the action servers have a Cancel BT node that you can simply call at that point. So maybe the pause/resume BT node could be a decorator that when its a new pause, does a sequence of these cancelations. \n\nThis has the added benefit of not requiring any topic magic or storing values, it just uses the values in the BT blackboard already and we don't need to resend actions. The downside is that it wouldn't persist between boots. \n\n---\n\nArguably, given how easy this one conceptually is to do, we may find it beneficial to offer both for those that like one over another. I would be interested in community feedback if everyone just likes one over the other so that maybe we don't need to offer both, but both are definitely possible. Maybe worth posting on discourse to ask for feedback?\n\n", "@pranavk-2003 any updates on your side otherwise I would take over and finish up the implementation.", "> [@pranavk-2003](https://github.com/pranavk-2003) any updates on your side otherwise I would take over and finish up the implementation.\n\nyes , i am almost done with the pose_saver & pose_restore.If you can help with the pause and resume tool, would be great!" ],

      "description" : "### Overview\n\nWhat is the problem we're solving? For very simple items, this can be encapsulated in the success criteria.\n\nElsewhere we convert our units from thousand of dollars to dollars, and thousands of lbs to lbs. We haven't done consistently with all fields however. Notably, these fields are still in \"thousands of\" units:\n\n- `fgd_sorbent_consumption_1000_tons` (to be transformed in the `_core_eia923__fgd_operation_maintenance` function in `pudl.transform.eia923.py`)\n- `max_steam_flow_1000_lbs_per_hour` (to be transformed in the `_core_eia860__boilers` function in `pudl.transform.eia860.py`)\n- `steam_load_1000_lbs` (should be converted in the `pudl.extract.epacems.py` module)\n\n### Success Criteria\n\nHow will we know that we're done?\n\n* [ ] `fgd_sorbent_consumption_1000_tons` -> `fgd_sorbent_consumption_tons`\n* [ ] `max_steam_flow_1000_lbs_per_hour` -> `max_steam_flow_lbs_per_hour`\n* [ ] `steam_load_1000_lbs` -> `steam_load_lbs`\n\n### Get set up\n- [ ] Fork the PUDL repository and follow the steps to set up the [PUDL development environment](https://catalystcoop-pudl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/dev_setup.html)\n- [ ] Activate the pudl-dev environment: mamba activate pudl-dev\n- [ ] Grab the latest raw data for any relevant tables - in this case, EIA 860, EIA 923 and EPACEMS. To do so, run `pudl_datastore --dataset eia923`, ` pudl_datastore --dataset eia860`, and `pudl_datastore --dataset epacems` (the last one pulls a large chunk of data, and might take a while).\n- [ ] For the first two variables: First, generate the raw assets upstream of the transform: follow the instructions to [open Dagster](https://catalystcoop-pudl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/run_the_etl.html#running-the-etl-via-the-dagster-ui), and in the left-hand menu find the \"raw_eia923\" asset group, e.g.. Click \"Materialize all\".\n\n### Next steps\n* [ ] For each field, identify the first `_core` or `core` table in which it is transformed (see pudl.metadata.resources`).\n* [ ] In the corresponding transform function, divide this field by one thousand.\n* [ ] Update the field description, units and name\n* [ ] Update the [alembic schema](https://catalystcoop-pudl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/run_the_etl.html#database-schema-migration)\n- [ ] For the last variable: CEMS processing happens all in one step. To test your implemented solution, you'll simply need to find the \"core_epacems__hourly_emissions\" asset in the \"Asset\" tab, and materialize it. For the other two variables, you can generate the affected assets (e.g., `_core_eia923__FGD_operation_maintenance`) and inspect them in `devtools/inspect_assets.ipynb`.\n",

It seemed to work fine but today, my hard drive is not being read. is it possible something from the download could have caused this?

Do I need to run etl_fast or something first? I am new to dagster, so I am not 100% sure what I need/will need to do.

I found the following tables that correspond to the three columns, `_core_eia923_fgd_operation_maintenance`, `core_eia860__scd_boilers`, and `core_epacems_hourly_emissions`, respectively. Would my next step be to create the draft PR and add the transform for the respective transform/extract.py you have listed above? \n3.

So if you remove `1000` from the `metadata.fields` but the resource is still defining a field that has `1000` in it, you'll get that KeyError.\n\nI also did a quick search in the repo for other `fgd_sorbent_consumption` references. You'll probably also need to update the alembic schema as mentioned in the issue description, as well as the validation test schema in `dbt/models/eia923/_core_eia923__fgd_operation_maintenance/schema.yml`.\n", "I opened a draft PR and will work there.

      "description" : "#### Description\n\nThe `Recipe.model_dump()` output cannot be parsed back into a `Recipe` object using `Recipe.model_validate(...)`. This breaks round-trip serialization/deserialization using Pydantic's methods and is likely due to internal transformations not being mirrored in both directions.\n\n---\n\n#### Minimal Reproducible Example\n\n```python\nimport yaml\nfrom llmcompressor.recipe import Recipe\n\nrecipe_str: str = \"\"\"\nfinetuning_stage:\n    finetuning_modifiers:\n        ConstantPruningModifier:\n            targets: [\n            're:.*q_proj.weight',\n            're:.*k_proj.weight', \n            're:.*v_proj.weight',\n            're:.*o_proj.weight',\n            're:.*gate_proj.weight',\n            're:.*up_proj.weight',\n            're:.*down_proj.weight',\n            ]\n            start: 0\n\"\"\"\n\nyaml_loaded = yaml.safe_load(recipe_str)\nrecipe_object = Recipe.model_validate(yaml_loaded)\n\n# This line fails\ndeserialized_recipe = Recipe.model_validate(recipe_object.model_dump())\n```\n\n#### Error Traceback\n\n```bash\nValidationError: 1 validation error for Recipe\n  Assertion failed, stages must be a dict, given [{'group': 'finetuning', 'args': None, 'enabled': True, ...}]\n```\n\n---\n\n#### Version Info\n\n- **Commit tested:** `25b11382`\n- **Branch:** `main`\n\n---\n\n#### Expected Behavior\n\n`Recipe.model_validate(recipe.model_dump())` should succeed, ensuring round-trip compatibility through standard Pydantic APIs.\n\n---\n\n#### Why This Goes Unnoticed\n\nMost usage currently relies on `Recipe(...).yaml()` for serialization, which applies internal transformations before converting to YAML. These transformations are not applied in `model_dump()` which leads to invalid data structures on deserialization.\n\n---\n\n#### Proposed Solution\n\nEnsure that `Recipe.model_dump()` applies the same transformations as `Recipe(...).yaml()`, or expose a new method like `to_validated_dict()` that outputs a structure suitable for re-validation with `Recipe.model_validate(...)`.\n\n---\n\n#### Additional Context\n\nThis bug affects all recipes, not just the example above. Any recipe passed through `model_dump()` and then `model_validate()` will fail without the YAML-specific serialization pathway.\n",

      "description" : "Hello, fellow contributors! Thanks for coming here \uD83C\uDF1F \n\nIn https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/pull/4808, I started some work to make the test faster but didn't apply the techniques implemented to every test since there are so many of them, and that's where you can help us.\n\nThere are two tasks to do that I???ll highlight right below.\n\n### Patching the `.wait_task(:task_id)`\n\nA common pattern you'll see in the integration tests is that we create a task and then immediately wait for it by writing `.wait_task(0).await;` or any other number.\nHere's an example: https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/blob/abe128476fca60d683725f2598a365027ef5fbec/meilisearch/tests/tasks/mod.rs#L111-L134\n\nThis is really easy to get wrong and caused us a lot of flaky tests in the past; that's why we would like to get rid of all these calls and replace them with the actual task ID returned by Meilisearch.\n\nFor example, instead of doing:\n```rust\n    let index = server.index(\"test\");\n    index.create(None).await;\n    index.wait_task(0).await;\n```\n\nWe should write:\n```rust\n    let index = server.index(\"test\");\n    let (task, _code) = index.create(None).await;\n    index.wait_task(task.uid()).await;\n```\n\nAlso, did you notice how we're waiting for the task to finish, but then we don't check if it succeeded?\nWhen the task was supposed to succeed in the tests, you should also call `.succeeded()` after waiting for the task:\n\n```rust\n    let index = server.index(\"test\");\n    let (task, _code) = index.create(None).await;\n    index.wait_task(task.uid()).await.succeeded();\n```\n\n### Using a shared server when possible\n\nA lot of tests are creating a new Meilisearch instance when they could instead share one with all the other tests.\nThe rules to know if a test can use a shared server are:\n- It should use the default configuration; the server is initialized with `let server = Server::new().await;`\n- It must **not** modify the global state of the index:\n  - Don't add an API-key\n  - Don't modify the features\n  - Don't access indexes that are not yours\n- ??? An exception, though, is if the request is expected to fail in the test. For example, if the test try to delete an arbitrary index and then checks for its failure, in this case, we can implement a new method on the shared index, send the task, and ensure it fails; see this method for an example: https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/blob/c45706936732aef16d5a07545e47534d59901a91/meilisearch/tests/common/server.rs#L218-L225\n\n\nhttps://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/blob/abe128476fca60d683725f2598a365027ef5fbec/meilisearch/tests/search/geo.rs#L41-L63\n\nThis test, for example, only creates an index and modifies its content without altering any of the global state of the index.\nWe can update the server initialization from:\n```rust\n    let server = Server::new().await;\n    let index = server.index(\"test\");\n```\n\nTo:\n\n```rust\n    let server = Server::new_shared().await;\n    let index = server.unique_index(); // we cannot hardcode the name of an index; otherwise, we might have conflicts between tests\n```\n\n### Using a shared index when possible\n\nThe latest kind of big optimization possible is to reduce the number of times we index the same documents over and over again.\nFor example, if you look at this file: https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/blob/abe128476fca60d683725f2598a365027ef5fbec/meilisearch/tests/search/geo.rs\nYou'll notice a common pattern: All the tests start by doing these operations and then do a single search request:\n```rust\n    let server = Server::new().await;\n    let index = server.index(\"test\");\n\n    let documents = DOCUMENTS.clone();\n    index.update_settings_filterable_attributes(json!([\"_geo\"])).await;\n    index.update_settings_sortable_attributes(json!([\"_geo\"])).await;\n    index.add_documents(documents, None).await;\n    index.wait_task(2).await;\n```\n\nWhat we should do here is create a shared index between all these tests that index the documents only once and can then be used by everyone. Here's an example of how to do it: https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/blob/c45706936732aef16d5a07545e47534d59901a91/meilisearch/tests/common/mod.rs#L200-L216\n\nIn this case, instead of creating a new set of `DOCUMENTS` and a new kind of `shared_index_with_geo` we could simply update the original `DOCUMENTS` set defined [here](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/blob/c45706936732aef16d5a07545e47534d59901a91/meilisearch/tests/common/mod.rs#L165-L198) and update then use the shared index function to get an index.\n\nIn the end, the test should look like this:\n\n```rust\nlet index = shared_index_with_documents().await;\n\n// The search requests\n```\n\nOnce again, this optimization can only be applied to tests that don't modify the content of the index:\n- Can't insert or update documents\n- Can't delete documents\n- Can't update the settings\n- Can almost exclusively run searches, get documents, and stuff like that\n- ??? An exception, though, is if the request is expected to fail in the test. For example, if the test adds a wrong setting and then checks for its failure, in this case, we can implement a new method on the shared index that runs send the task and then ensures it fails; see this method for an example: https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/blob/c45706936732aef16d5a07545e47534d59901a91/meilisearch/tests/common/index.rs#L259-L274\n\n### The file to updates\n\nHere's an almost exhaustive list of files that need to be updated:\n\n- [ ] meilisearch/tests/auth/tenant_token.rs\n- [ ] meilisearch/tests/auth/tenant_token_multi_search.rs\n- [x] meilisearch/tests/documents/add_documents.rs - Done by @martin-g in https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/pull/5574\n- [x] meilisearch/tests/documents/delete_documents.rs - Done by @martin-g in https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/pull/5619\n- [ ] meilisearch/tests/documents/errors.rs\n- [x] meilisearch/tests/documents/get_documents.rs Done by @PedroTurik in https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/pull/5025\n- [x] meilisearch/tests/documents/update_documents.rs Done by @PedroTurik in https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/pull/5026 & @martin-g in https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/pull/5682\n- [x] meilisearch/tests/index/create_index.rs Done by @DerTimonius in https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/pull/4962\n- [x] meilisearch/tests/index/delete_index.rs Done by @DerTimonius in https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/pull/4963\n- [x] meilisearch/tests/index/get_index.rs Done by @martin-g in https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/pull/5578\n- [x] meilisearch/tests/index/stats.rs Done by @martin-g in https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/pull/5572\n- [x] meilisearch/tests/index/update_index.rs Done by @martin-g in https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/pull/5579\n- [x] meilisearch/tests/search/errors.rs - Done by @martin-g in https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/pull/5599\n- [x] meilisearch/tests/search/facet_search.rs - Done by @martin-g in https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/pull/5600\n- [x] meilisearch/tests/search/formatted.rs Done by @PedroTurik in https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/pull/5043\n- [x] meilisearch/tests/search/locales.rs - Done by @martin-g in https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/pull/5601\n- [x] meilisearch/tests/search/matching_strategy.rs - Done by @martin-g in https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/pull/5602\n- [ ] meilisearch/tests/search/mod.rs\n- [ ] meilisearch/tests/search/multi.rs\n- [ ] meilisearch/tests/search/pagination.rs\n- [ ] meilisearch/tests/search/filter.rs - Done by @martin-g in https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/pull/5622\n- [x] meilisearch/tests/search/restrict_searchable.rs - Done by @martin-g in https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/pull/5605\n- [x] meilisearch/tests/settings/distinct.rs - Done by @martin-g in https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/pull/5620\n- [x] meilisearch/tests/settings/get_settings.rs - Done by @martin-g in https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/pull/5607\n- [x] meilisearch/tests/settings/proximity_settings.rs - Done by @martin-g in https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/pull/5609\n- [x] meilisearch/tests/settings/tokenizer_customization.rs - Done by @martin-g in https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/pull/5610\n- [x] meilisearch/tests/settings/prefix_search_settings.rs - Done by @martin-g in https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/pull/5681\n- [x] meilisearch/tests/vector/binary_quantized.rs Done by @martin-g in https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/pull/5618\n- [ ] meilisearch/tests/stats/mod.rs\n- [x] meilisearch/tests/tasks/mod.rs - Done by @martin-g in https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/pull/5615\n- [x] meilisearch/tests/similar/errors.rs - Done by @martin-g in https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/pull/5621\n- [x] meilisearch/tests/similar/mod.rs - Done by @martin-g in https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/pull/5680\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Please open one PR per file updated\n\n### What to do if I???m struggling\n\nPlease ping me and ask me questions on this issue; this will help others as well.",

This is somewhat of the opposite - using the normal HTLC logic for a self-payment anyway.\n\nWell, in both cases we'll have to deal with the case where the destination / route's last hop is our own node. The only difference is the length of the circle. I agree it's a bit orthogonal, but at the very least we'll need to make sure that the short-circuiting for the 0-hop case is done in a way that still allows us to send payments across circular paths with >0 length.", "Sure, indeed, but no reason we can't make progress on this issue while work goes on there." ],

Sometimes we have `Record {` linked, sometimes we have `Record {` unlinked, most times we just use `{`. Some of these these are just omitting `Property Descriptor {`, which we should fix. But I don't think we should necessarily add `Record {` in front of all of them, even though the JS spec does. It's verbose and many of these could probably be converted to Infra maps anyway.

The following sections will be managed by moderators only._\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n\n- [ ] The `Module_With_Inline_Data_Trait` trait should be removed, while keeping the `Module_With_Inline_Data` interface.\n- [ ] The `Modules::inline_modules_data()` method should be updated to iterate over modules that implement the interface and collect their data.\n- [ ] Modules should return unkeyed data arrays from `get_inline_data`, with slug-based keying handled by the `Modules` class.\n\n## Implementation Brief\n\n- [ ] <!-- One or more bullet points for how to technically implement the feature. Make sure to include changes to Storybook and visual regression tests where relevant. -->\n\n### Test Coverage\n\n- <!-- One or more bullet points for how to implement automated tests to verify the feature works. -->\n\n## QA Brief\n\n- <!-- One or more bullet points for how to test that the feature works as expected. -->\n\n## Changelog entry\n\n- <!-- One sentence summarizing the PR, to be used in the changelog. -->\n",

      "description" : "### Summary\n\nWhile adding the runtime validations for the Typescript implementation of AWS Powertools Lambda Metrics, I noticed an issue when a metric name with either an empty string or with a string longer than 255 characters was used, the metrics were not being written. If this validation is not done in the runtime, the metrics will get dropped by Cloudwatch.\n\n### Why is this needed?\n\nAs per the [MetricDatum API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_MetricDatum.html), the Metric Name has a length constraint of a minimum of length 1 and a maximum of length 255. There is a validation for the metric name not being empty which satisfies the minimun length constraint. But, there validation for the metric name when it is longer than 255 characters is missing on the `AddMetric` function in the `Metrics` utility. If we pass ina string with more than 255 characters currently as the metric name, those metrics are being dropped by Cloudwatch silently.\n\n### Which area does this relate to?\n\nMetrics\n\n### Solution\n\n1. Runtime Metric Name Type Validation\n\nThe Typescript implementation includes a runtime check to ensure that metric name is a string and the length constraint is satisfied. If an invalid value is passed, it raises a RangeError.\n\nTypescript code:\n\nif (!isString(name)) throw new Error(`${name} is not a valid string`);\nif (\n  name.length < MIN_METRIC_NAME_LENGTH ||\n  name.length > MAX_METRIC_NAME_LENGTH\n)\n  throw new RangeError(\n    `The metric name should be between ${MIN_METRIC_NAME_LENGTH} and ${MAX_METRIC_NAME_LENGTH} characters`\n  );\n\n[Typescript Source Code](https://github.com/aws-powertools/powertools-lambda-typescript/blob/main/packages/metrics/src/Metrics.ts#L1081-L1088)\n\n[.NET Source](https://github.com/aws-powertools/powertools-lambda-dotnet/blob/develop/libraries/src/AWS.Lambda.Powertools.Metrics/Metrics.cs#L181-L185)\n\n### Acknowledgment\n\n- [x] This request meets [Powertools for AWS Lambda (.NET) Tenets](https://docs.powertools.aws.dev/lambda/dotnet/#tenets)",

This change aligns with the structured pattern introduced in [PR #1432](https://github.com/finos/architecture-as-code/pull/1432) for fields like `name` and `description` across other response types (e.g., Standards, Groups). This structure improves semantic clarity and enables richer metadata handling in UIs and clients.\n\n### User Stories:\n- As a **developer building UI components**, I want the `/calm/namespaces` endpoint to return structured name data so that I can display additional context like descriptions.\n- As a **consumer of the OpenAPI spec**, I want consistent response shapes across endpoints so that I can auto-generate more reliable client models.\n- As a **maintainer**, I want the namespace model to match others (e.g., Standard, Group), so the API is easier to understand and maintain.\n\n### Current Limitations:  \nThe `name` field in the `Namespace` response is currently a plain string, which lacks descriptive context and is inconsistent with newer API responses that return structured objects.\n\n### Proposed Implementation:\n- **Technical design considerations:**\n  - Introduce a new reusable schema (e.g., `DescriptiveName`) in OpenAPI with:\n    ```yaml\n    name:\n      type: object\n      properties:\n        value:\n          type: string\n        description:\n          type: string\n    ```\n  - Refactor the `Namespace` response schema to use this structure for `name`.\n\n- **API changes:**\n  - The `/calm/namespaces` response will change from:\n    ```yaml\n    name: string\n    ```\n    to:\n    ```yaml\n    name:\n      value: string\n      description: string\n    ```\n\n- **Data model changes:**\n  - Ensure the backend response model includes the new object structure.\n  - If needed, update any mapping or DTO classes in the application code to support the new shape.\n\n- **Dependencies:**\n  - Requires consistency with the approach established in PR #1432.\n  - Potential updates needed in any client code relying on the current shape of the `name` field.\n",

      "description" : "### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.\n\nI'm in the middle of moving, and have spent the last few weeks with a steel cargo container in my yard. Every time I see it, every single time, I think \"why don't we have these in CDDA!?\"\n\nIt is possible I have a problem.\n\nThat problem is, of course, THE LACK OF INTERMODAL TRANSPORT CONTAINERS.\n\nFor reference, these bad boys are what we're talking about.\n<img width=\"257\" height=\"196\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40414994-d3b4-479f-807b-83df2bb3a527\" />\n\n<img width=\"273\" height=\"185\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0fdc8409-ee63-481d-8cf6-f5ae9af7c0a4\" />\n\n### Solution you would like.\n\nI believe an intermodal containers should be a vehicle. The first and most important way to model them is as a vehicle, and for that we should have a few custom vehicle panels so that I can sprite them to look like what they are: the intermodal container is a very well recognized structure, and missing them in game is a big deal.\n\nAs a start, I'd just love to see someone go to the work of designing them, and maybe putting a few of them rarely in front of houses, and frequently in various industrial places. Then, in follow up, we can have some that contain interesting or boring things. Eventually we should see these in railyards and shipyards in huge numbers. However, those are later steps. This is a good first issue for someone who wants to learn how to make a custom vehicle in JSON, but it is a little bit involved so while I am flagging it \"good first issue\", I really recommend doing something very very small and trivial for your *first* first issue.\n\n#### How I'd design them:\nIntermodal containers are typically 8' x 20' or 8' x 40'. The 20' variety should look like this:\n```\nWWWWW\nWfffW\nWfffW\nWfffW\nWfffW\nWfffW\nWfffW\nWfffW\nWfffW\nWfffW\nWfffW\nWfffW\nWDDDW\n```\nWhere W is a full height vehicle wall with a new custom panel style, \"transport_container\" - which comes in \"container_side\", \"container_door_corner\", \"container_end_corner\", and \"container_end\"\nAnd where D is a vehicle door similar to the trunk, where opening one door opens both doors, with a new custom sprite as well.\n- Ideally, but not necessary, we could add code where opening one door opens the door next to it, but not all three doors, so that opening the middle tile opens both but opening the left tile opens only the left and middle and opening the right opens the right and middle. That would let us model it as two doors despite taking three tiles. However, I think doing it all as one door is the easiest way and we already have that code.\n- These doors should be very loud to open! And a bit slow.\nAnd where `f` is probably just standard cargo storage space, but with a new visual variant.\n\nWe could add the 40' variety but as you see, they'd get pretty long in game.\n\n### Describe alternatives you have considered.\n\nThere was a time when I thought we'd also want them as terrain so that we could have furniture in them, but now that we can drag furniture into vehicles, that might not be necessary. For starters, we should get htese as vehicles and see how it works.\n\nIf we model them as vehicles then you can push them around and things, which is sooooo aaawwwweesome.\n\n### Additional context\n\nLong-term, I would like to have different colour choices for these and put them into a vehicle group so you can just place a 'container' and get different skins. Then I might also be able to work in a few with graffiti and stuff, which would really enhance the look, but the odds of me getting that much sprite art done without getting distracted are... not great.\n\nIn the future, it may be possible to repurpose bicycle code to load intermodal containers onto appropriate flatbed trucks. That would be amazing\n\nEventually, intermodal containers would be a good way to begin thinking about some simple multi-z-level vehicle code, allowing us to stack them on top of each other.",

You'd still have to figure out how to operate such a door, though, as the current solution is to use a control to the side, not acting on the gate itself.", "Shipping containers slide quite easily, when hit with enough force like another car. Towing them should be of limited use.\n\nContainer transport trucks actually don't need s crane to lift them, just a tilting flatbed with a winch to pull them up. It's pretty cool. It has no relation to stacking them in shipyards though.\n\nThe door system for trunks on cars already does what you're describing. If you open one, it opens them all." ],

Please describe.\n\nWhen defining default preloads of nested associations in the code interface, it???s not incredibly difficult to get entangled in the syntax of keyword lists and write something that looks like it should work:\n\n```elixir\n    resource FuwaDB.Game.Item do\n      define :get_item_by_id,\n        action: :read,\n        get_by: :id,\n        default_options: [\n          load: [\n            :class_job_category,\n            [params: :param]\n          ]\n        ]\n    end\n```\n\nBut instead produces an error message that???s hard to digest:\n\n```elixir\niex(38)> FuwaDB.Game.get_item_by_id(46640)\n** (FunctionClauseError) no function clause matching in Ash.Resource.Info.attribute/2\n\n    The following arguments were given to Ash.Resource.Info.attribute/2:\n\n        # 1\n        FuwaDB.Game.Item\n\n        # 2\n        {:params, [:param]}\n\n    Attempted function clauses (showing 1 out of 1):\n\n        def attribute(resource, name) when is_binary(name) or is_atom(name)\n```\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nI think unwrapping the nested lists would be incredibly user-friendly, but even providing a friendly, understandable error message would put the user on the correct path to fixing the syntax.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\nThis feature request is based on Discord conversation, [available here](https://discord.com/channels/711271361523351632/711271361523351636/1395600736074727617) for more context.",

Instead of ILLink/ILCompiler targets setting these, we could delay giving them a default value until right before the value is needed (i.e. we could set it right before `Defaults @(RuntimeHostConfigurationOption) items based on MSBuild properties.` in the file).", "> Did we consider moving the defaults to Microsoft.NET.Sdk.targets?\n\nCould work, but I see two potential concerns:\n- It's technically a breaking change for any MSBuild logic that was checking any of these properties after the Microsoft.NET.ILLink.targets (but before the Microsoft.NET.Sdk.targets import). Probably uncommon, but the break makes me a little uncomfortable.\n- There are some new switches in .NET 9. If we put all defaults into the Sdk.targets they will result in extra RuntimeHostConfigurationOptions for apps that target .NET 8 (because the ILLink targets are TFM-specific, but the Sdk targets are not)." ],

      "url" : "https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/106560",
      "repositoryName" : "dotnet/runtime",
      "description" : "### Description\n\nHello,\r\n\r\nThere is long story with Turkish '??' and 'i'. Many details can be found here: http://www.i18nguy.com/unicode/turkish-i18n.html\r\nLong story short - With Turkish locale ToUpper should transform text in this way:\r\ni -> ?? (dotted i)\r\n?? -> I (dottless ??)\r\n\r\nFor investigation I am using phrase 'Anl??yorum bilgi edinin i??'. Transformation TpUpper should give result '**ANLIYORUM B??LG?? ED??N??N ????**', but MAUI on **Android** platform is '**ANLIYORUM BILGI EDININ I??**'\r\n\r\nIt's working fine with plain .NET8 console app, proof: https://dotnetfiddle.net/fIV4eQ\r\n\r\nI found two issues reported at dotnet / runtime project that are describing that issue. Both were closed with comments that were pointing that root cause is Android ICU and dotnet familly can not do much about it.\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/77689\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/102622\r\n\r\nBut I started to dig a bit deeper. I found out that when I run Kotlin project with Android studio everything is fine. I forked some github project that is setting Locale to specific language. When I set 'en' it is giving me 'ANLIYORUM BILGI EDININ I??', but then  setting 'tr' locale produces 'ANLIYORUM B??LG?? ED??N??N ????'. Everything is proper at here. So why it's not with MAUI Android? Repository for my forked Kotlin project: https://github.com/sowacx/WizardOfLocale-maui-investigation\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6dbb06f2-8f5c-4f04-af40-d87544d84623)\r\n\r\nThen I tried to call setLocale the same way as in Kotlin App. That is possible by overriding MainActivity method AttachBaseContext. Code looks like that:\r\n```cs\r\nusing Android.App;\r\nusing Android.Content;\r\nusing Android.Content.PM;\r\nusing Android.Content.Res;\r\nusing Android.OS;\r\n\r\nnamespace TurkishSandbox;\r\n\r\n[Activity(Theme = \"@style/Maui.SplashTheme\", MainLauncher = true, LaunchMode = LaunchMode.SingleTop,\r\n    ConfigurationChanges = ConfigChanges.ScreenSize | ConfigChanges.Orientation | ConfigChanges.UiMode |\r\n                           ConfigChanges.ScreenLayout | ConfigChanges.SmallestScreenSize | ConfigChanges.Density)]\r\npublic class MainActivity : MauiAppCompatActivity\r\n{\r\n    protected override void AttachBaseContext(Context baseContext)\r\n    {\r\n        Java.Util.Locale locale = new Java.Util.Locale(\"tr\");\r\n        Java.Util.Locale.Default = locale;\r\n\r\n        Resources res = baseContext.Resources;\r\n        Configuration config = new Configuration(res.Configuration);\r\n        if ((int)Build.VERSION.SdkInt >= 17)\r\n        {\r\n            config.SetLocale(locale);\r\n            config.SetLayoutDirection(locale);\r\n            baseContext = baseContext.CreateConfigurationContext(config);\r\n        }\r\n        else\r\n        {\r\n            config.Locale = locale;\r\n            res.UpdateConfiguration(config, res.DisplayMetrics);\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        base.AttachBaseContext(baseContext);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAdditionally I set up Cultures to 'tr-TR' at MauiApplication c'tor. But that all did not fix problem. \r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2ae689c-55af-4d67-9a7e-61b00b24b733)\r\n\r\nMy MAUI project to reproduce: \r\nhttps://github.com/sowacx/maui-turkish-locale-issue\r\n\r\n\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Create MAUI Boilerplate app.\r\n2. Place Label at MainPage.xaml\r\n`<Label\r\n    Text=\"Anl??yorum bilgi edinin i??\"\r\n    TextTransform=\"Uppercase\"\r\n    Style=\"{StaticResource Headline}\"\r\n    SemanticProperties.HeadingLevel=\"Level1\" />`\r\n3. Explicitly set up 'tr-TR' culture or change Android phone language to Turkish\r\n4. Run\r\n5. New label text should be 'ANLIYORUM B??LG?? ED??N??N ????', but it is 'ANLIYORUM BILGI EDININ I'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Link to public reproduction project repository\n\nhttps://github.com/sowacx/maui-turkish-locale-issue\n\n### Version with bug\n\n8.0.40 SR5\n\n### Is this a regression from previous behavior?\n\nNo, this is something new\n\n### Last version that worked well\n\nUnknown/Other\n\n### Affected platforms\n\nAndroid\n\n### Affected platform versions\n\nAndroid 14\n\n### Did you find any workaround?\n\nUnfortunately no\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_",

Filter using keyword \"prize\"\n\n2. Out of the following icons only 1 works:\n\n<img width=\"1071\" height=\"638\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7fc8c7d-93f8-4186-a759-78c54b6b5aa5\" />\n\n3. It means I have to go and try it, iterate back and forth between building and refreshing the browser several times to only find that \"millitary_tech\" is the only available icon in that list. \n\n\nThis is frustrating and counter-productive, an update could really go a long way. Another solution could be to use an npm package like [material-symbols](https://www.npmjs.com/package/material-symbols) that **auto-updates from Google's official set. It means the icons will stay fresh.**\n\n\n### Directus Version\n\nV11.9.2\n\n### Hosting Strategy\n\nSelf-Hosted (Custom)\n\n### Database\n\n_No response_",

In the JVM world, there is another implementation called [GraalPy](https://github.com/oracle/graalpython), which is backed by a big company (Oracle) and has Python 3 support, with more active development. Don't be misled by its name, it can be used with the normal JVM.\nSo I think it's worth mentioning in this section.\n\n### Describe alternatives you have considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

E.g. if the function is defined as: `def fun(value: int = 5)` there is no need to document that `5` is the default for `value` in the docstring. It is already visible in the function definition. However, if the function is defined as `def fun(value: int | None = None)` and in the code we do: `if value is None: value = 5` we should document that value is set to `5` by default as this is not evident from the function definition.\r\n* Make full sentences when writing comments\r\n* Do not add comments if it is evident from the code what is happening\r\n\r\n## How to work on this issue\r\n\r\n1. Take any file from one of the modules listed below\r\n2. Make sure that all public functions/classes/methods are well documented. You can also split the work into multiple PRs for files with many functions or classes with many methods.\r\n3. Add documentation if necessary\r\n4. Create a PR named \"Add documentation for <filename>\" and push your changes\r\n\r\n## Tasks\r\n- [ ] #1217\r\n- [x] #1223\r\n- [x] #1673\r\n- [x] #1687\r\n- [x] #1663\r\n- [ ] #1674\r\n- [x] #1675\r\n- [x] #1670\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "description" : "### Is there an existing issue already for this feature request/idea?\n\n- [x] I have searched for an existing issue, and could not find anything. I believe this is a new feature request to be evaluated.\n\n### What problem is this feature going to solve? Why should it be added?\n\nRight now, the `Database` CRD only manages the `owner` of the schema.\n\nPostgreSQL provides two privileges as part of the `GRANT` command on schemas: `CREATE` and `GRANT`. See [\"SQL Grant\"](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-grant.html).\n\nUsers are now using the post initialization scripts for this, making it imperative, one-off and thus fragile.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nProviding usage permissions on managed schema objects as part of the `Database` CRD.\n\nThe `GRANT` SQL command in Postgres has the following syntax:\n\n```sql\nGRANT { { CREATE | USAGE } [, ...] | ALL [ PRIVILEGES ] }\n    ON SCHEMA schema_name [, ...]\n    TO role_specification [, ...] [ WITH GRANT OPTION ]\n    [ GRANTED BY role_specification ]\n```\n\nBoth `GRANTED BY` and `WITH GRANT OPTION` are not suitable for a declarative environment typical of CloudNativePG, so we will focus only on `CREATE` and `USAGE`.\n\nA possible implementation could be:\n\n```yaml\n# ...\nspec:\n  schemas:\n  - name: app\n    owner: app\n    create:\n    - name: angus\n      type: grant\n    - name: brian\n      type: revoke\n    usage:\n    - name: angus\n      type: grant\n    - name: brian\n      type: grant\n# ...\n```\n\nThe default `type` is `grant`.\n\nFor example, the above will check that `angus` hasn't got yet the `create` privilege for the `app` database and run the required `GRANT CREATE ON app TO angus`. Similarly, if `brian` has `create` usage on the same `app` schema, it will run `REVOKE CREATE ON app FROM angus`.\n\nSee: [`REVOKE`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-revoke.html).\n\nPlease feel free to change the above proposal if you have a better idea.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nWe could do nothing, and delegate this operation to another tool.\n\nHowever, I personally think that this is a good responsibility for the `schema` management feature in the `Database` CRD.\n\n### Additional context\n\nN/A\n\n### Backport?\n\nNo\n\n### Are you willing to actively contribute to this feature?\n\nYes\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct",

Check that no other contributor is working on this issue. If someone is assigned to the issue or claimed to be working on it, ping the person. After one week without a response, the assignee may be changed.\n1. Leave a comment indicating that you are working on the issue, or just create a [pull request](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pulls) after following the steps below. [Mention](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) this issue in the description of the pull request.\n1. Fix the issue locally.\n1. [Run the test suite](https://llvm.org/docs/TestingGuide.html#unit-and-regression-tests) locally. Remember that the subdirectories under `test/` create fine-grained testing targets, so you can e.g. use `make check-clang-ast` to only run Clang's AST tests.\n1. Create a Git commit.\n1. Run [`git clang-format HEAD~1`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html#git-integration) to format your changes.\n1. Open a [pull request](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pulls) to the [upstream repository](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project) on GitHub. Detailed instructions can be found [in GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

Totally understand if you???re still on it!", "Hi @woruyu, I'm still working on it but I'd be happy to work on it with you. ", "Hi @trnguyen34, thanks for the update!\n\nI???ve already posted a draft PR for the ARMISD::VORRIMM support in computeKnownBitsForTargetNode, but I haven???t found a minimal test case that clearly exercises the new logic.\n\nOne tricky part is that the immediate operand in VORRIMM is actually an encoded value, not the real splat constant. So to get correct known bits, we need to call ARM_AM::decodeVMOVModImm with the proper element size. Just using getConstantOperandAPInt gives the wrong result in many cases.\n\nIf you???d like to verify or experiment with this, the following function is a good way to trigger the pattern:\n```llvm\n; RUN: llc < %s -mtriple armv7-linux-gnueabihf -mattr=+neon | FileCheck %s\ndefine void @test_v2i8(ptr %p) {\n  %a = load <2 x i8>, ptr %p\n  %tmp = call <2 x i8> @llvm.cttz.v2i8(<2 x i8> %a, i1 false)\n  store <2 x i8> %tmp, ptr %p\n  ret void\n}\n``` \nThis will eventually lower into a sequence containing VORRIMM, so it???s useful for testing both codegen and known bits behavior.\n\nHope my suggestions and the draft PR help make the problem clearer and help you understand it clearer!" ],

To give one example, if I'm quoting a brief passage that contains quotation marks???\n\n> During this time the  meanings of \"liveness\" and \"presence\" were indistinguishable from Western discourses of modernization.\n\n???I'll need to convert the double-quotes used in the quotation to single-quotes in my paper, like so:\n\n> Lisa Parks argues that \"during this time the  meanings of 'liveness' and 'presence' were indistinguishable from Western discourses of modernization.\"\n\nThis sort of thing can be done by hand or with find-replace (if find-in-region were a thing in Zettlr; see #4040). But it's also the sort of yak shaving/repetitive task that cries out for automation, particularly when using a tool like Zettlr that contains other features of advanced text editors.\n\n### Proposed Changes\n\nMany programming text editors contain a menu or sub-menu from which users can select text transformations that are common in programming, such as changing tabs to spaces, toggling upper and lower case characters, straightening quotes, etc. For instance, BBEdit has a killer `Text` menu:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/caa059ea-7846-462f-8763-fa0e57431161)\n\nI'm suggesting that Zettlr add a similar menu or sub-menu populated with text transformations that are common in academic or journalistic writing. These could include:\n\n- Double quotes to single quotes. (See above.)\n- Single quotes to double quotes.\n- Italics to quotes (e.g., for changing `_Cultures in Orbit_` to `\"Cultures in Orbit\"` to satisfy a different style guide.)\n- Quotes to italics.\n- Join lines (a.k.a. unfill-region, see #4039)\n- Sentence case to title case.\n- Title case to sentence case.\n\n???and possibly others.\n\nPossible locations for these menu items could include the edit menu (or a sub-menu under the edit menu), the right-click context menu when text is selected in the editor, or a top-of-screen toolbar button. Some of the most commonly used transforms might also be given their own keyboard shortcuts.\n\n### Caveats\n\nNone.\n\n### Do you Wish to Attempt Implementing this Yourself?\n\nNo\n\n### Zettlr Version\n\nNightly\n\n### Your Platform\n\n- [ ] Windows\n- [ ] macOS\n- [x] Linux\n\n### Operating System Version\n\nManjaro (Rolling)\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_",

Similarly, text cut and pasted from LaTeX documents will often have pairs of single quotes and/or backticks in place of double-quotes. A transform that converted paired single quotes and paired backticks to double-quotes would come in handy from time to time.\n- Different style guides advise for or against using spaces on either side of emdashes.

I think the older #4039 may also be a sub-issue of this now.", "Good catch, added!", "@richdouglasevans and @nathanlesage ??? As promised, here is a composite PDF from which you can glean text to test the various transforms.\n\nBelow are the representative passages for cutting and pasting. I notice that the cut-and-paste behavior differs somewhat depending on the PDF viewer from which the text is copied to the clipboard. Zotero's on-board PDF viewer, for example, seems to replace line breaks with extra spaces, while other PDF viewers introduce hard wraps for each line of text. In any case, here goes:\n\nThis passage from Lisa Parks' _Cultures in Orbit_ demonstrates #5680 (paired quotes to double quotes):\n\n```\nOur World???s structure established precedents for subsequent\nglobal television coverage, alternating between live views of the television\nstudio, maps, and remote locations, interpellating the viewer not only as\n??????globally present?????? but as ??????culturally worldly?????? and ??????geographically mobile.??????\nSeen by millions of viewers throughout North America and Europe, this\nearly experiment helped to determine one of the cultural forms of satellite\ntelevision.\n```\n\nWhen I paste it from Zotero's PDF viewer, instead of the hard wraps, I get #5679 (duplicate spaces):\n\n```\nOur World???s structure established precedents for subsequent  global television coverage, alternating between live views of the television  studio, maps, and remote locations, interpellating the viewer not only as  ??????globally present?????? but as ??????culturally worldly?????? and ??????geographically mobile.??????  Seen by millions of viewers throughout North America and Europe, this  early experiment helped to determine one of the cultural forms of satellite  television.\n```\n\nThis passage from Evans and Ludgren's _No Heavenly Bodies_ has some wicked hard wraps that could be resolved with #4039 / unfill-region (Zotero again changes these wraps to duplicate spaces):\n\n```\nThe launch of Sputnik and Yuri Gagarin???s flight, of course, ??were impor??tant\nlandmarks of the Space Race and widely considered to be significant victo-\nries for the Soviet ??Union during the Cold War. 2 However, the act of broad-\ncasting Gagarin???s return to Moscow to audiences in Western ?? E\nurope was not\nan example of unidirectional propaganda, but rather a cooperative effort\nby broadcasters in both the Soviet U\n ?? nion and ??Europe.3\n```\n\nThis passage from Patrick Robert Parsons' _Blue Skies_ has more hard wraps, as well as smart quotes, both single and double, to be straightened (#5675). Once straightened, the quotes could also be used to test #5686 (converting between double and single quotes). It also has an emdash with no spaces around it (#5681): \n\n```\nThe consumer could choose from\nthree-inch tubes to ???giant??? twenty-inch screens, as well as direct view pic-\nture tubes or early ???projection screen??? receivers. None of the sets were cheap.\nPrices ranged from $99 to nearly $5,000 for custom-built models.12 The av-\nerage selling price was around $575 in 1947 and, although prices came down\na bit each year, it was still a costly adventure.13 As historians Christopher\nSterling and Michael Kittross noted: ???The typical 5-inch to 7-inch receiver\ncost from $375 to $500 in mid-1948???several weeks??? pay for the average\nworker. \n```\n\nAnd the excerpt of the interview with Whitney Phillips from Nieman Lab contains emdashes that do have spaces around them (#5681):\n\n```\nOur world is awash in mis- and disinformation. Conspiratorial thinking\nand misguided beliefs and attitudes towards science are widespread. But\ncombatting this deluge of problematic information must be done with care.\nToo often, argues Whitney Phillips, we dismiss the people who consume or\npropagate such information as irrational. In fact, given the experiences\nthey may have been having on the internet for many years ??? or what they\nmay have been encountering via traditional media for decades ??? their\nviews, troubling as they may be, may in many cases be perfectly rational.\n```\n\n[TransformExamples.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19493251/TransformExamples.pdf)", "Love it @wideaperture ??????\n\nIt's immediately thrown up stuff \uD83E\uDD73 For example, the excerpt from Evans and Ludgren's _No Heavenly Bodies_ includes some unwanted line breaks... I ran the command in my dev version of Zettlr and they're removed. Sadly, the text has some \"funky\" whitespace that confounds the existing transforms.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c7bff1e-a9f1-475d-a871-a6d8908ecc7b)\n\nThat \"whitespace\" is `SPACE` + `SOFT HYPHEN` ([?](https://www.ascii-code.com/CP1252/173)) + `SPACE`.\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74d612bf-92f4-4a11-ac2f-de86b75e4f54\n\nI'll leave it to you and Hendrik to decide _What_ to do here; perhaps there's a composite transform called `Zap Gremlins` that does a whole bunch of cleanup on a selected block of text:\n\n* remove unwanted line breaks\n* strip duplicate spaces\n* remove any soft hyphens, hairline spaces, that sort of thing\n* more?\n\nIn any case, GREAT! Having real data to work with is fantabulosa ??????", "Thank you, @richdouglasevans! I love the idea of a `Zap Gremlins` option. Another Zettlr-adjacent app, Scrivener, [seems to have this feature](https://forum.literatureandlatte.com/t/what-is-zap-gremlins/44999/2), so some users may already be familiar with it:\n\n> Text Tidying ??? Zap Gremlins Strips Unicode and ASCII control characters from the selection. If you are having difficulties compiling, or have found areas in your text where the cursor seems to get ???stuck??? when moving through ranges of text, your document may have acquired these invisible control characters from somewhere. This command will strip out all of the Unicode characters falling within the range of #x00 to #x1F, save for the necessary #x09, #x0A, #x0C and #X0D characters, which are used to print spaces, line returns, page breaks and tabs in your text.\n\nI haven't used Scrivener in something like 12 years, so I had no idea they had implemented this. It seems, in fact, like we've independently arrived at [nearly all the same features](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/clean-up-your-texts-with-scrivener):\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ecb032c-e896-4f17-a53d-f39ff569010c)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3869737-f59d-42d8-a3e8-dc77cd3813ff)\n\nI think the only (relevant, non-word processor-y) ones not on our list are `Zap Gremlins`, `Strip Leading Tabs/Spaces`, `Make Uppercase`, and `Make Lowercase`.", "@nathanlesage Any sense of when these features might be code-reviewed/merged?

If all goes well I'll implement the other text transforms secure in the knowledge that the approach has been signed-off by Hendrik (and others) and any \"dumb\" first-time contributor stuff is sorted.\n\nIn your comment on that PR you expressed a potential reservation about the approach taken; [you wrote](https://github.com/Zettlr/Zettlr/pull/5701#issuecomment-2772653913):\n\n> I'll have to think if it's really adequate to have the transform commands implemented using a factory style.\n\nThe other twelve or so transforms all use the exact same approach; I am loathe to raise twelve or more PRs only to receive a review comment along the lines of _\"This approach is inadequate.\"_ You know what I mean? :D\n\nMmm \uD83E\uDD14 What I'll do is raise exactly one more PR for another transform so that you can see how the approach works across two distinct transforms. I will action any review comments you leave and, hopefully, PRs for the remaining transforms will flow in quickly with (relatively) minimal review required because the approach has been signed-off.\n\nI'll raise that PR tomorrow and then reply to this conversation with a sorted list of exactly two PRs ??????", "Sounds good! Thanks for sticking with me, even if it took a while \uD83D\uDE48", "I've updated the single existing PR with another commit.\n\n* #5701\n\nI've done another commit as opposed to another PR because this work is still \"up in the air\" about the approach. The approach might be rubbish in which case deleting one PR and branch is easier than two PRs and two branches.\n\nFor the reviewer -- Hendrik I reckon \uD83D\uDE04 -- I suggest starting in the `transforms` directory: each transform is implemented in its own file. If we go ahead with this approach there will eventually be 12+ distinct transform files in this directory.\n\n<img width=\"377\" height=\"475\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e7e36fd-950e-4103-a9ee-24b0cb43d946\" />\n\n\nThe `transform-selected-text.ts` [file](https://github.com/Zettlr/Zettlr/pull/5701/commits/22720ecb402506888a02907f14727b2fa221962a#diff-c8b72e744c4ad2c580752e458bcf587e1990c8c8d87d5b0ef4d0bb0886ddcc88R39) contains the machinery for all these transforms: the `transformSelectedText` higher-order function accepts some transformation function -- it doesn't care what the specifics of the transformations are -- and it handles all the CodeMirror machinery.\n\nThis leaves the implementation for each transform free to focus on just doing the transform:\n\n* the `stripDuplicateSpaces` transform [is trivial](https://github.com/Zettlr/Zettlr/pull/5701/files#diff-f8e8885cfb2144e5180d7d5d6dfb15c4dcb19151b1e0cf2833a6281538246534R16): the JSDoc is longer than the implementation.\n* the `italicsToQuotes` [transform](https://github.com/Zettlr/Zettlr/pull/5701/files#diff-26c049ca247b0a5c20b97524cf86d333cf7a28ef5d727ade068ec5909cd80c09R16) is the most \"complicated\" transform which is why I chose to include it as the only other transform in this PR. It uses Hendrik's existing AST code in the implementation following a steer from Hendrik.\n\nThe other transforms are somewhere between these two in terms of implementation complexity. (Many are one-liners.) They all use the `transformSelectedText` higher-order function which does not change across all 12+ transformations.\n\nEach transformation has unit tests: indeed, the unit test code dwarfs the implementation code.\n\nThere are some outstanding questions around I18N and, I think, around adding these transformation commands to the app's menu somewhere. (Currently the transforms are only exposed via the context menu.)", "> Hiya [@wideaperture](https://github.com/wideaperture) and [@richdouglasevans](https://github.com/richdouglasevans) -- I know this issue has been open a bit, but I really do want to fast-track this now.\n> \n> My idea currently is the following since [@kyaso](https://github.com/kyaso) and [@sensologica](https://github.com/sensologica) have little time right now:\n> \n> It might make sense to put this even before the table editor.

      "url" : "https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/issues/311",
      "repositoryName" : "fedify-dev/fedify",
      "description" : "### Summary\n\nThe `fedify webfinger` command is missing the `--max-redirection` option that should be available to control the maximum number of redirections allowed during WebFinger lookups, similar to the configurable `maxRedirection` option that was recently added to the WebFinger lookup API.\n\n### Problem\n\nThe `fedify webfinger` command was added in issue #260 and implemented in PR #278, but it was created before the `maxRedirection` option was added to the WebFinger lookup API (issue #248, PR #281). As a result, users of the CLI command cannot configure the maximum number of redirections allowed during WebFinger lookups, while users of the programmatic API can.\n\nThis inconsistency creates a gap in functionality where:\n- The underlying `lookupWebFinger()` function accepts a `maxRedirection` option (defaults to 5)\n- The CLI command has no way to pass this option through to the underlying function\n- Users who need to control redirection behavior must use the programmatic API instead of the convenient CLI command\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nAdd a `--max-redirection` option to the `fedify webfinger` command that:\n\n1. **Accepts a number parameter** specifying the maximum number of redirections to follow\n2. **Defaults to the same value as the API** (5 redirections) when not specified\n3. **Passes the value through** to the `lookupWebFinger()` function's `maxRedirection` option\n4. **Validates the input** to ensure it's a valid positive integer\n5. **Provides helpful error messages** for invalid values\n\n#### Implementation Details\n\nUpdate `cli/webfinger.ts`:\n- Add the option definition: `.option(\"--max-redirection <maxRedirection:number>\", \"Maximum number of redirections to follow (default: 5)\")`\n- Pass the option to the `lookupWebFinger()` call: `await lookupWebFinger(url, { ...options, maxRedirection: options.maxRedirection })`\n- Add appropriate validation if needed\n\n#### Example Usage\n\n```bash\n# Use default redirection limit (5)\nfedify webfinger @user@example.com\n\n# Set custom redirection limit\nfedify webfinger @user@example.com --max-redirection 3\n\n# Disable redirections entirely\nfedify webfinger @user@example.com --max-redirection 0\n```\n\n\n### Alternatives Considered\n\n1. **Leave as-is**: This would maintain the current inconsistency between CLI and API functionality\n2. **Add a configuration file option**: More complex to implement and use for a single parameter\n3. **Use a different option name**: `--max-redirection` follows the same naming convention as the API parameter\n\n\n### Scope / Dependencies\n\n**Files to modify:**\n- `cli/webfinger.ts` ??? Add the new option and pass it through to the lookup function\n\n**Dependencies:**\n- This enhancement depends on the `maxRedirection` option being available in the `lookupWebFinger()` function (already implemented in PR #281)\n- No breaking changes to existing functionality\n- Backward compatible ??? existing commands will continue to work with the default behavior\n\n**Components affected:**\n- CLI webfinger command\n- No changes required to the underlying WebFinger lookup functionality",

Please describe.\n\nTimestamps are crucial for a wide range of applications including time-series data analysis, event tracking, and log management among others. By introducing a timestamp data type, Milvus can broaden its use case coverage and provide better service to applications that are time-sensitive. This enhancement will involve the design and implementation of the timestamp data type, ensuring its correct representation, and providing efficient querying capabilities based on time. Further, it will be necessary to create comprehensive documentation and examples to guide users on how to utilize this new data type effectively in their Milvus-based applications. This feature will significantly improve Milvus???s capability in handling time-oriented data and open new avenues for real-world applications.\r\n\r\nYou have to implement timestamp data type and finish at least one SDK (Go, Java, Python) support too\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe an alternate solution.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?

Given that `fplll` [also solves the closest vector problem](https://github.com/fplll/fplll), one could add the option to use that algorithm to `closest_vector`, setting the existing algorithm to default. \n2. Using the `pari` algorithm in `shortest_vector` implicitly uses `qfminim` with `flag=0` ([see pari source docs](https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/dochtml/html/Vectors__matrices__linear_algebra_and_sets.html#se:qfminim)). This means computing all vectors of shortest and storing them before chosing one. Taking `flag=1`, i.e. having \n```\n_, v = qf.__pari__().qfminim(flag=1)\nv = v.sage()\n```\nwould be more memory efficient and a quick check shows that it can be faster, though how much time is saved may just be minimal.

There is a `size` property when defining the uniform, so the equivalent to `array<i32, 100>` would be:\n```typescript\n  const shader = PIXI.Shader.from({\n    gl: {\n      vertex: vertexSimple,\n      fragment: fragmentMask,\n    },\n    resources: {\n      uTexture: mapData.source,\n      defaultGroup: {\n        uRevealedRegions: {\n          value: [1, 16, 72],\n          type: 'i32',\n          size: 3,\n        },\n      },\n    },\n  });\n```\nAs you can see, you can put any size you wish.

For example, if we are using enums, the compiler does the validation for us. The GetOperator() function is generated by protoco, so switching the proto field does not add any manual work on our side. \nA drawback is that we need a helper function to convert the enums back to the legacy string. \n\nAnother drawback is the breaking change for our partners in the EU projects. So I would say, we use your proposal to use the operators as constants. \n\nBut the constants we should add in the `internal/config.go` or in the `policies/policies.go`file.

Expected: number, given: boolean  3:flags.is-enabled: Must validate all the schemas (allOf) \n`\n\nThis leads to inconsistent behavior during evaluations (https://github.com/open-feature/flagd/issues/1481)\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThere are a couple of behaviors that could make sense:\n- when flag config validation fails, return an error and don't accept the updated config, essentially keep working with whatever was already in the flag store (preferred)\n- possibly, accept only parts of the config that conform to the schema and return a warning / error (probably not a good idea)\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nUse the following flag config. The variants have mismatched types (number and boolean).\n\n```\n{\n    \"$schema\": \"https://flagd.dev/schema/v0/flags.json\",\n    \"flags\": {\n      \"is-enabled\": {\n        \"defaultVariant\": \"off\",\n        \"state\": \"ENABLED\",\n        \"targeting\": {\n          \"if\": [\n            {\n              \"<\": [\n                {\n                  \"%\": [\n                    {\n                      \"var\": \"request_id\"\n                    },\n                    1000\n                  ]\n                },\n                100\n              ]\n            },\n            \"on\",\n            \"off\"\n          ]\n        },\n        \"variants\": {\n          \"on\": 1,\n          \"off\": false\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n```",

      "description" : "Als Gruppenverwalter in hitobito\nm??chte ich es schwieriger haben, Gruppen zu l??schen,\num versehentliche Gruppenl??schungen zu vermeiden.\n\nEs ist erstaunlicherweise tats??chlich regelm??ssig ein Problem, dass ganze Gruppen aus Versehen gel??scht werden. Das obwohl heute bereits mindestens 3 Fehlklicks n??tig sind, um eine Gruppe zu l??schen. Dabei werden die enthaltenen Rollen mitgel??scht (Enddatum gesetzt). Die Gruppe kann von den Usern \"reaktiviert\" werden, aber die darin enthaltenen Rollen sind dann weg. M??glicherweise verwechseln einige Nutzende die Gruppe l??schen Funktion mit der Funktion, ein einzelnes Mitglied zu \"l??schen\".\n\nNeu soll beim L??schen einer Gruppe nicht mehr ein simpler JavaScript Alert mit generischem Text erscheinen, bei welchem die User stumpf auf OK klicken k??nnen, wie sie es sich gewohnt sind. Stattdessen soll man w??hrend dem L??schen einer Gruppe zur Best??tigung den Gruppennamen in ein Eingabefeld einf??llen m??ssen.\n\n# Mockup\n\n![Screenshot from 2023-01-10 11-20-22](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7566995/211525403-7afce648-726f-4c92-99d1-57494fe4cf85.png)\n\nWeitere Ideen:\n- Verlangen, dass \"Generalsekretariat l??schen\" eingetippt wird\n- Im Dialog auch die Anzahl und Art der gel??schten Rollen anzeigen\n- Im Titel bereits m??glichst spezifisch vom Gruppennamen sprechen, da dieser in einer Wand von Text am ehesten noch gelesen wird\n- Mehr rote Warnfarben und Icons einsetzen\n\n# Tech-Spec\n\n- Umsetzung im Core\n- Der Mechanismus ist von GitHub abgeschaut, wo man zum L??schen eines Repositories auf ??hnliche Art dessen Namen eintippen muss\n- ??hnliche Modal Dialoge gibt es bereits bei den Mehrfachaktionen in Personenlisten (wenn man ein H??kchen bei Personen setzt) [[1]](https://github.com/hitobito/hitobito/blob/master/app/views/people/_multiselect_actions.html.haml#L6..L10) [[2]](https://github.com/hitobito/hitobito/blob/master/app/controllers/role_lists_controller.rb#L15) [[3]](https://github.com/hitobito/hitobito/blob/master/app/views/role_lists/new.js.haml) [[4]](https://github.com/hitobito/hitobito/blob/master/app/views/role_lists/_new.html.haml) [[5]](https://github.com/hitobito/hitobito/blob/master/app/views/role_lists/_form.html.haml)\n\n# ToDo\n\n- [ ] Neue Action `confirm_deletion` im [GroupsController](https://github.com/hitobito/hitobito/blob/master/app/controllers/groups_controller.rb) welche [nur auf JS-Requests](https://github.com/hitobito/hitobito/blob/master/app/controllers/role_lists_controller.rb#L15) antwortet\n- [ ] JS-Template erstellen, welche ??hnlich wie bei den [bestehenden Modal Dialogen](https://github.com/hitobito/hitobito/blob/master/app/views/role_lists/new.js.haml) ein HTML-Template rendert und dieses in die Seite einf??gt wenn der Browser den JS-Code interpretiert\n- [ ] HTML-Template erstellen gem??ss Mockup (weitere Ideen die unter dem Mockup stehen umsetzen soweit als sinnvoll erachtet)\n  - [ ] Der Submit Button soll via JS deaktiviert sein, solange das Input-Feld nicht den gew??nschten Wert enth??lt. Dabei sollen Whitespace am Anfang und Ende sowie Gross-/Kleinschreibung ignoriert werden.\n  - [ ] Es ist okay, wenn der User den Gruppennamen in das Textfeld copy-pastet. Allein schon die Interaktion mit Freitext forciert die mentale Anwesenheit des Users.\n  - [ ] Das Formular im Dialog soll auf die bisherige DELETE-Action im GroupsController targeten. Es ist egal ob der Inhalt des Textfelds mitgesendet wird, die Validierung bzw. (De-)Aktivierung des Submit-Buttons kann komplett in JavaScript ablaufen.\n- [ ] Im Dropdown-Men?? auf der Gruppe den [L??schen-Eintrag](https://github.com/hitobito/hitobito/blob/master/app/helpers/dropdown/group_edit.rb#L39..L40) ??ndern, sodass er nicht mehr den JS-Alert verwendet (`data: { confirm: ... }`), sondern die neue `confirm_deletion` Action mit `format: :js` aufruft (mit `remote: true` damit die Seite beim Klicken nicht neu geladen wird, sondern stattdessen der retournierte JS-Code in der laufenden Seite ausgef??hrt wird)\n- [ ] Feature Specs schreiben (??hnlich wie f??r die [Multiselect Actions](https://github.com/hitobito/hitobito/blob/master/spec/features/role_lists_controller_spec.rb), aber in einer neuen Spec-Datei /spec/feature/groups_controller_spec.rb\n- [ ] Kunde wegen ??bersetzungen informieren\n- [ ] Mit angemessener Rolle \"durchklicken\"\n- [ ] CHANGELOG-Eintrag unter \"unreleased\" unten hinzuf??gen\n",

This is because Steam???s API uses the server???s public IP address, not the domain name, for health checks.\n\nMy context:\n\n    I have a dynamic IP, so I use a domain name (via dynamic DNS) to always point to my current IP.\n\n    When I enter the domain name in Kuma, the health check fails because Steam tries to use the domain name, not the resolved IP.\n\nExpected behavior:\n\nI would expect Kuma to resolve the domain name to its current IP and use that IP in the request.\n\n### \uD83C\uDFF7??? Feature Request Type\n\nOther\n\n### \uD83D\uDD16 Feature description\n\nPlease consider adding a feature that allows Kuma to resolve a domain name to its IP address and then use that IP when performing Steam server health checks.\n\nWhy this is useful:\n\n    Steam???s API works only with IPs, not domain names.\n\n    For users with dynamic IPs, using a static domain name is necessary.\n\n    This feature would make Kuma compatible with dynamic IP setups while still enabling Steam server monitoring.\n\n\n\n\n### ??????

      "description" : "## The issue\nOn a Speaker card, there are three possible actions for users:\n- Navigate to the speaker profile (currently works well, as the profile chip background changes on hover. Let???s keep this!\n- Bookmarking to a Session.\n- Navigate to the Session page.\n\nCurrently, clicking anywhere on the card navigates to the Session page. This is confusing because:\n- The Session title (h3) gets underlined on hover, suggesting a different action, but clicking it still navigates to the Session page.\n- For bookmarking a session, there is no clear visual indicator, especially for mobile users (see attached recording).\n\n## Suggestions\nMake sure each action has a distinct and clear visual indicator, we could:\n1. Add a state change on hoovering over the icon that actions bookmarking a session\n2. Limit navigation to a Session page only to clicking on a Session Title (this would be inline with the underline that we currently have)\n\n\n**Recording**\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e1d02e5-40cf-439b-92f2-3ace4c539fa4\n",

When you edit connections, you should be able to see all fields (including sensitive ones) - password is only masked in order to avoid someone standing behind your back read the password - but other than that you can reveal and see it anyway - the settings you refer to are only for masking thing in logs. But yeah, I guess in the UI we could also mask sensitive fields to avoid this scenario of someone behind your back looking at your screen while you are editing the connection. New feature. not a bug. Marking as \"good first issue\". ", "Oh, that's interesting what you wrote, @potiuk. When we had Airflow 3.0.2 deployed, the fields 'private_key' and 'private_key_passphrase' were actually masked with '***', so I thought it was a new feature compared to Airflow 2.8.4, which we had deployed earlier. However, after upgrading to 3.0.3, the field masking disappeared, so I thought it was a bug in the newer Airflow version.\nI'll try deploying a test instance of 3.0.2 to see what happens.", "Interesting. Yes", "> Interesting. Yes\n\nHey @potiuk, just a quick update: I've deployed the test instance of Airflow 3.0.2, and here's what the Edit Connection window looks like after adding a new connection.\nNow, a question: Is hiding those fields a feature or a bug in version 3.0.2? :P\nThe configuration files are the same, except that I have removed this in order to have the exact same environment as before the update to version 3.0.3:\n> sensitive_var_conn_names = private_key,private_key_passphrase\n\n\n<img width=\"923\" height=\"718\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2d366dd-3a49-4804-90a1-98c26f4b85e5\" />\n\n<img width=\"928\" height=\"766\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66652248-bac5-4ded-83a1-1a2d55116e4e\" />" ],

If used, the live provider for supabase will send an invalid filter payload, causing the realtime request to fail.\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create any realtime resource\r\n2. Add more than 1 filter to the resource (I was using a useList hook with multiple objects in the filters option)\r\n3. Watch websocket network requests, it will show an error.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI think we should either log a warning if we see multiple filters, or naively take the first one? \r\n\r\n### Packages\r\n\r\n- supabase realtime v2.30.34 (not latest, but also not fixed in latest)\r\n- @refinedev/supabase 5.9.4\r\n\r\n### Additional Context\r\n\r\nSee here for Refine's implementation, where it is joining each filter with a comma. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/refinedev/refine/blame/8be95d808ae2f3f280ebd015bd95eb04238fe463/packages/supabase/src/liveProvider/index.ts#L67\r\n\r\nSee here for feature that is being discussed.

We believe this approach is correct. What do you think?", "My workaround for now was picking one filter that did 90% of the server side filtering then did the rest on the client side. So you're saying that you will remove the filtering altogether?", "> My workaround for now was picking one filter that did 90% of the server side filtering then did the rest on the client side. So you're saying that you will remove the filtering altogether?\r\n\r\n\r\nI was wrong. [In this use case](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/discussions/6366), the filters must work. We'll investigate [this issue](https://github.com/supabase/realtime-js/issues/97) and see what we can do.\r\n\r\nWe're currently considering showing a warning when multiple filters are used and allowing users to override the `liveProvider`'s filters using the `meta.realtimeFilters` prop.\r\n", "I've also bumped [an issue](https://github.com/supabase/realtime/issues/486#issuecomment-2371379197) directly inside supabase/realtime to see what the status is there.", "Until there are any updates in the supabase side, we should have this working without an error. Picking the first filter will work for many cases but it must be configurable (like `meta.realtimeFilter`). When working with multiple filters, realtime subscription may log a warning (like @alicanerdurmaz stated) about the current issue and say that only the first filter is picked etc.\r\n\r\nIf Supabase starts supporting multiple filters in the future, we can just deprecate the `realtimeFilter` and revert back to the current state \uD83E\uDD14 \r\n\r\nMaybe @alicanerdurmaz can provide a detailed description for the implementation we want and it will be a guide for anyone interested in working on this issue \uD83D\uDE80 \uD83D\uDE80 ", "@amerryma @aliemir \r\n\r\nI think it would be good to warn if there is more than one filter and allow the user to override the filter if needed. \r\n\r\n1. **Warning for Multiple Filters**  \r\n   If more than one filter is used, show a warning to user.

This is because the footer is not sticking to the bottom, but is attached to the end of the content. \n\n### To Reproduce\n\n1. Go to nightly.decidim.org/onefkjenfrekjfnc (or any page that does not exist)\n2. See error\n\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI expect the footer to be at the bottom of the page. If that would lead to too much empty space in the content, then I would expect the empty space at the bottom to be the same color as the footer.\n\n### Screenshots\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/377f2cd5-82dd-4418-bdc7-d0d2340252f2)\n\n### Stacktrace\n\n_No response_\n\n### Extra data\n\n- Device: MacBook Pro\n- Device OS: MacOs\n- Browser: Safari, Firefox, Chrome\n- Decidim Version: 0.28-0.31dev\n- Decidim installation: nightly, but observed on every platform with the redesign\n\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

This likely causes the LLM output to appear outside your custom tags, leaving the tag empty instead of wrapping the LLM output as before [[source]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/blob/37e19de7ab3d8c1ffd8dfd8b789ff52b47f981cb/api/core/workflow/nodes/answer/answer_node.py).\n\nThere???s no documentation or open issue directly tracking this, but similar regressions have happened before when output formatting or merging logic was refactored. If you need a workaround, try adjusting your template or node configuration to see if you can force the LLM output inside the tag, or temporarily revert to 1.4.3 if that???s feasible for your deployment. If you???re using structured output, double-check your schema and model compatibility, as recent changes in structured output handling have also caused related issues for some users [[source]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/20975).\n\nIf you need to track this for a future fix, keep an eye on changes to `answer_node.py` and related workflow node logic in upcoming releases.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

The regression with your custom tag is more likely due to changes in how the answer node parses and merges templates and variables. Specifically, the answer is now assembled by splitting your template into text and variable chunks, then merging them, which can cause issues if the chunk boundaries don't align with your tags (for example, if you have a template like `<tag>{{#llm#}}</tag>`)??[[source]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/blob/37e19de7ab3d8c1ffd8dfd8b789ff52b47f981cb/api/core/workflow/nodes/answer/answer_stream_generate_router.py).\n\nIf your tags are ending up empty, it's likely because the variable replacement logic is splitting the template in a way that separates the tag from the variable. This is unrelated to ArrayFileSegment and is instead a subtle change in the template parsing or merging logic. You might be able to work around this by adjusting your template so that the variable is not directly inside the tag, or by experimenting with different placements of your tags and variables. If you need to dig deeper, reviewing the logic in AnswerStreamGeneratorRouter and the template parsers (PromptTemplateParser, VariableTemplateParser) will show exactly how the chunks are split and merged.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

The frontend now uses a custom Rehype plugin that strips or alters any HTML tag that doesn't match the regex /^[a-z][a-z0-9]*$/i, converting it to plain text. This means custom tags (like `<tag>`) are no longer rendered as HTML elements, which is why your LLM output appears outside the tag or the tag appears empty in the UI, even though the backend (and debug panel) output is correct. This stricter sanitation was likely added for security reasons and is not documented as a breaking change, so it may not have been present or as strict in 1.4.3??[reference](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/blob/37e19de7ab3d8c1ffd8dfd8b789ff52b47f981cb/web/app/components/base/markdown/index.tsx).\n\nTo work around this, you can use only standard HTML tags supported by the renderer, or adjust your template to avoid custom tags.

I have successfully reproduced the problem and found the root cause.\n\nThe issue is not a bug in the traditional sense, but rather a conflict with standard web rendering rules that occurs within Dify's frontend processing.\n\n### The Quickest Solution (Recommended)\n\nThe fastest and most stable way to solve this is to use a standard **block-level element** instead of a custom `<tag>`. This ensures your wrapper is always compliant, regardless of what the model outputs.\n\n**Instead of this:**\n```html\n<tag>{{#llm.text#}}</tag>\n```\n\n**Use this:**\n```html\n<section data-type='dify'>{{#llm.text#}}</section>\n```\n\n<img width=\"1149\" height=\"244\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe70da80-a668-4916-af98-d4607b574532\" />\n\n<img width=\"846\" height=\"424\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/864bae63-4f7e-454d-9845-98abefdecbd2\" />\n\nYou can also use a `<div>` with a custom class or data attribute. This approach is guaranteed to work without requiring any changes to the Dify source code.\n\n### The Deeper Explanation & The Alternative Path\n\nThe core of the issue lies in how Dify's frontend handles the model's \"think\" content.\n\nDify's Markdown rendering pipeline uses a toolset called `rehype`, and specifically the `rehype-raw` plugin, to process and sanitize raw HTML from the model. According to web standards, your custom `<tag>` is treated as an **inline element** (like a word), while the model's thinking process (`<think>...`) is converted into a `<details>` tag, which is a **block-level element** (like a paragraph).\n\nThe problem arises because a fundamental rule of HTML is that an inline element cannot wrap a block-level element. When `rehype` sees this, it \"corrects\" the structure by closing your `<tag>` prematurely, which is what causes the issue you're seeing.\n\nTo properly support custom inline tags like `<tag>` or `<noah>` as wrappers, it would require modifying the `rehypePlugins` configuration in Dify's core frontend code. We would need to create a special rule to treat these non-standard tags as block-level elements. Personally, I don't strongly recommend this path as it introduces custom logic that can be brittle and hard to maintain across Dify updates.\n\nHowever, it is technically possible. What do you think, would you be interested in giving that a try and submitting a PR?\n", "@xuzijie1995 \nThe scenario is a bit different from mine. I added \"no_think\" to the prompt. At the same time, I modified some dependencies of openai-api-compatible so that it doesn't output an empty <think></think>.  So, does the problem of block-level elements you mentioned no longer exist?\nHere, when using the Qwen3 model, there is another problem I mentioned in #21677 , which led to the confusion of the if-else nodes??????the text in answer node 2 also outputs when the branch actually goes in answer node 1.\n\n<img width=\"2391\" height=\"1348\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3690b342-4ea8-4332-b3d2-15db84126c64\" />", "I'm more focused on the tag issue.

The behavior you're seeing is not a bug, but rather the correct and expected outcome based on the official Markdown specification.\n\nHere???s a simple breakdown of what???s happening:\n\n**1. The Root Cause: Blank Lines Separate Paragraphs**\nThe most fundamental rule to remember is that in Markdown, one or more blank lines are always used to signal the end of a paragraph and the beginning of a new one.\n\n**2. Why `<section>` Works but `<tag>` Fails: A Tale of Two Rules**\nThe Markdown parser treats HTML tags differently depending on whether it recognizes them as standard \"block-level\" containers:\n\n*   **Known Block Tags (`<section>`, `<div>`):** The parser recognizes `<section>` as a standard HTML tag designed to contain other blocks of content. When it sees an opening `<section>` tag, its main goal is to find the matching `</section>` tag, treating everything in between???including blank lines???as part of that single section. This is why it works as you expect.\n\n*   **Unknown/Custom Tags (`<tag>`):** The parser does not recognize `<tag>` as a standard block-level element. It therefore falls back to a stricter, simpler rule for raw HTML: **\"This HTML block ends at the very next blank line.\"**\n\n**Putting It All Together**\n\nWhen you use `<tag>`, the parser sees the blank line in your content and immediately terminates the HTML block. As the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) analysis confirmed, this forces the parser to split your content into two separate paragraphs:\n1.  The first paragraph contains your initial text and the opening `<tag>`.\n2.  The second paragraph contains the main content and the closing `</tag>`.\n\nBecause the opening and closing tags end up in different paragraphs, the browser can no longer match them, leading to the broken output.\n\nUse the core dependencies of `react-markdown` and the built-in parsing engine `remark` to run the generated Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).\n\ntag\n``` AST\n--- AST Start ---\n{\n  type: 'root',\n  children: [\n    {\n      type: 'paragraph', // 1st p\n      children: [\n        { type: 'text', value: '??????????????????2??????????????????[??????\\n' },\n        { type: 'html', value: '<tag>' } // <tag> here\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      type: 'paragraph', // 2nd p\n      children: [\n        { type: 'text', value: '??????????????????...' },\n        { type: 'html', value: '</tag>' }, // </tag> here\n        { type: 'text', value: '\\n??????' }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n--- AST End ---\n```\n\nsection \n```\n{\n  \"type\": \"root\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"paragraph\",\n      \"children\": [\n        { \"type\": \"text\", \"value\": \"...\" }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"html\",\n      \"value\": \"<section>\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"paragraph\",\n      \"children\": [\n        { \"type\": \"text\", \"value\": \"...\" },\n        { \"type\": \"html\", \"value\": \"</section>\" }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Recommendations\n\nNo code changes are needed in the application, as it is correctly following the universal Markdown standard. The best solution lies in how the content is created:\n\n1.  **Best Practice: Use Standard HTML Tags.** When you need to wrap blocks of content, please use standard, well-defined HTML block-level tags like `<section>` or `<div>`. They are designed for this purpose and are understood correctly by the parser.\n2.  **Alternative: Control the Content's Newlines.** If you must use a custom tag, the content generator (e.g., an LLM) must not place blank lines (two or more consecutive newlines) inside it. A single newline for a simple line break is fine, but a blank line will always trigger a paragraph split.\n\n\nHope it can really solve your confusion. The question you raised actually stumped me too. :)" ],

This is a great idea for new audits and something we want to more accurately reflect in our performance simulations as well. \r\n\r\nThe primary trouble is that the SSL handshake details are frequently opaque to Lighthouse in many of our environments since it's handled at a much lower level. There are some extra manual checks we could try for each server, compare the ping time to SSL timing if we have it, etc, but those would also be very time consuming to do for all origins. \r\n\r\nIf you have ideas of how to easily detect suboptimal SSL server settings, your contributions would be very much appreciated :)", "Hi Patrick. \r\n\r\nI just tested OCSP on 2G and it did seem to make a notable change. There are drawbacks to OCSP such as the fact that it sends a request to the CA, which impacts privacy.

The returned time must include the time interval to establish the transport connection, as well as other time intervals such as SSL handshake and SOCKS authentication.\r\n\r\nSo by typing `performance.getEntriesByType(\"resource\")` you receive that info in the console for all objects associated to that page (I'm assuming). \r\n\r\nI haven't spent anytime with it too see if i can pull meaningful numbers from it.

The problem is that Airflow logs errors when a variable is not found, even if a default is provided.\n\nIn our use case, we have 100+ DAGs and use variables to configure schedules for them, so variables are read during DAG loading. This leads to significant error log spam that is picked up by Sentry. It's possible to work around this with custom logging filters, but I believe using the error log level is suboptimal and should be changed in Airflow core, especially considering `Variable.get` supports the \"default\" kwarg.\n\n### Related issues\n\n_No response_\n\n### Are you willing to submit a PR?\n\n- [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n",

Helps find runs that were delayed or executed later than expected\n\n- Filter by **Start Date**  \n  ??? Helps find runs that started during a specific window of time (e.g. following a system update)\n\n- Filter by **End Date**  \n  ??? Useful to identify runs that ended recently or ended during a problematic period\n\n- Filter by **Duration Range**  \n  ??? Identify long-running or stuck DAGs\n\n- Filter by **DAG Version** and/or **Bundle Version**  \n  ??? Correlate failures or anomalies with recent code or deployment changes\n\n- Filter by **Conf Key/Value**  \n  ??? Enables users to track down runs with specific parameters (e.g., a run triggered with a certain `partner_id`)\n\n- Filter by **Logical Date Range**  \n  ??? Useful for identifying runs within a specific scheduled interval (e.g., a regression starting on June 1)\n\n- Filter by **Triggered By** (e.g. manual, CLI, sensor, asset, backfill)  \n  ??? Quickly isolate runs from specific sources or trigger types\n\n- Filter by **Consuming Asset**  \n  ??? Identify DAG runs triggered by a specific upstream asset event\n\n- Filter by **Producing Asset**  \n  ??? Identify DAG runs producing a specific downstream asset event\n\n### API Support  \n\n?????? Partial\n\n- `/dagRuns` supports filtering by:\n  - `dag_id`\n  - `state`\n  - `run_type`\n  - `execution_date` (logical date)\n\n- Missing filter support for:\n  - Conf content (e.g., key/value search)\n  - Run-after range\n  - Logical date range\n  - DAG version or bundle version\n  - Trigger source (manual, CLI, etc.)\n  - Producing asset / Consuming asset\n\n### UI Impact  \n\n- Filters could be placed above the DAG Run table (as dropdowns, date pickers, or input fields)\n- Filtering improves usability in high-throughput environments and large DAGs\n- Enables faster root cause analysis and run correlation\n\n### Notes  \n\n- Conf filtering and trigger source filtering are especially useful for asset-aware and parameterized DAGs\n- Logical date and duration range are essential for tracking SLAs and performance regressions",

Each emitter implements specific operation from low level OpenVINO dialect.\n\n### Prerequisites\nDue to limited resources, cross compilation is preferred option now for building OpenVINO targeting RISC-V development boards. Please see the documentation [\"Cross compile OpenVINO??? Runtime for RISCV64 systems\"](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/docs/dev/build_riscv64.md) for more details. For this work, you need to build [`xuantie-gnu-toolchain`](https://github.com/XUANTIE-RV/) or [`riscv-gnu-toolchain`](https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain.git) with `QEMU` support for emulation. So you don't need to have RISC-V development board even to contribute to OpenVINO for these platforms \uD83D\uDE03 \n\n### What needs to be done?\n\n* Create `fp32` [Swish](https://docs.openvino.ai/2025/documentation/openvino-ir-format/operation-sets/operation-specs/activation/swish-4.html) operation [JIT Emitter](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/emitters/plugin/riscv64/jit_eltwise_emitters.hpp) for RISCV64 platform with RVV1.0 support. Use OpenVINO [CPU plugin JIT emitters](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/emitters/README.md) documentation and [RISC-V \"V\" Vector Extension](https://github.com/riscvarchive/riscv-v-spec/releases/tag/v1.0) documentation for details.\n* Support your implemented JIT Emitter in the [JIT Executor](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/4ebe493140b90cbaaa68e2c71fe8e1dbd7461822/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/nodes/eltwise.cpp#L805).\n* Modify [RISCV64 kernel](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/4ebe493140b90cbaaa68e2c71fe8e1dbd7461822/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/nodes/kernels/riscv64/jit_uni_eltwise_generic.hpp#L19) (in both places: [create_eltwise_emitter](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/4ebe493140b90cbaaa68e2c71fe8e1dbd7461822/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/nodes/kernels/riscv64/jit_uni_eltwise_generic.cpp#L401) and [get_supported_precisions](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/4ebe493140b90cbaaa68e2c71fe8e1dbd7461822/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/nodes/kernels/riscv64/jit_uni_eltwise_generic.cpp#L528)) to apply developed JIT emitter.\n\nBefore emitter implementation, please, modify tests to be sure that developed functionality is covered by test:\n * Add `jit` kernel check in [activation](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/0a177ff48a7197bee7eeb08f4e81b9d0ce8db271/src/plugins/intel_cpu/tests/functional/custom/single_layer_tests/classes/activation.cpp#L229) test, the test must fail.\n* If test doesn't fail then add supported operation in [CPU activation test instantiation](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/0a177ff48a7197bee7eeb08f4e81b9d0ce8db271/src/plugins/intel_cpu/tests/functional/custom/single_layer_tests/classes/activation.cpp#L263) if it's absent.\n\n### Tests\nTests are disabled in default build, so ensure to add `-DENABLE_TESTS=ON` into cmake command during the project configuration.\n\n[GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest) is used for testing. CPU functional test target is [ov_cpu_func_tests](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/tree/master/src/plugins/intel_cpu/tests/functional). You can use `GoogleTest` filter:\n```sh\n# If you use xuantie-gnu-toolchain:\n<xuantie_install_path>/bin/qemu-riscv64 -cpu rv64,x-v=true,vext_spec=v1.0 ./bin/[platform]/[build_type]/ov_cpu_func_tests --gtest_filter=\"*smoke*Activation*Swish*\"\n\n# If you use riscv-gnu-toolchain:\n<riscv_install_path>/bin/qemu-riscv64 -cpu rv64,v=true,vext_spec=v1.0 ./bin/[platform]/[build_type]/ov_cpu_func_tests --gtest_filter=\"*smoke*Activation*Swish*\"\n```\n\n### Example Pull Requests\n\n* [Abs](https://docs.openvino.ai/2025/documentation/openvino-ir-format/operation-sets/operation-specs/arithmetic/abs-1.html) operation: https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/pull/30218\n\n\n### Resources\n\n- [Contribution guide - start here!](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n- [What is OpenVINO?](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino#what-is-openvino-toolkit)\n- [CPU plugin JIT emitters](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/emitters/README.md)\n- [Blog post on contributing to OpenVINO](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n- [User documentation](https://docs.openvino.ai/)\n- [Intel DevHub Discord channel](https://discord.gg/7pVRxUwdWG) - engage in discussions, ask questions and talk to OpenVINO developers\n- [How to link your Pull Request to an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#manually-linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-the-pull-request-sidebar)\n-  [\"Cross compile OpenVINO???

Currently, this specific model is not mentioned in the documentation as a supported model.\n\nHowever, PR-Agent/Qodo Merge supports a wide variety of models through LiteLLM. To add support for a new model like KIMI K2, you would need to:\n\n1. Check if the model is supported by LiteLLM (the underlying library used by PR-Agent)\n2. If supported, configure it as a custom model using the custom model configuration options\n3. Set the appropriate environment variables as required by LiteLLM for that specific model\n\nFor custom models, you can configure them by:\n- Setting `model=\"custom_model_name\"` in your configuration\n- Setting `custom_model_max_tokens` for the model's token limit\n- Adding the required environment variables as specified in the LiteLLM documentation\n\nYou should check the LiteLLM documentation at https://litellm.vercel.app/docs/proxy/quick_start#supported-llms to see if KIMI K2 is supported and what environment variables are needed.\n\n#### Relevant Sources:\n\n> - https://qodo-merge-docs.qodo.ai//usage-guide/changing_a_model#custom-models\n> - https://qodo-merge-docs.qodo.ai//usage-guide/changing_a_model#changing-a-model-in-pr-agent\n", "@manku211 I find a solution\nset env\n```\nOPENAI__API_BASE=<moonshot-api>\nOPENAI__KEY=sk-...  \n```\nupdate config in  `configuration.toml`\n```\nmodel = \"openai/kimi-k2-0711-preview\"\ncustom_model_max_tokens=128000  \n```\nAll right !", "hey @lqd1434 @mrT23  I want to use  with docker command for model also with env something like this \n```\ndocker run --rm -it \\\n  -e OPENAI__KEY=sk-XXXX \\\n  -e OPENAI__API_BASE=<moonshot-api> \\\n  -e CONFIG__MODEL=openai/kimi-k2-0711-preview \\\n  -e GITHUB__USER_TOKEN=XXXX \\\n  codiumai/pr-agent:latest \\\n  --pr_url XXXXX\n```\nor do I need to run  manually with python command for changing configuration.toml file  for changing any model" ],

Is this request related to a challenge you're experiencing? Tell me about your story.\n\nI am asking for control over the index names created in the vector store when the documents are uploaded using the Knowledge feature.\n\nToday, Dify creates indicees in ElasticSearch named `vector_index_<uuid>`, but we need more granular control for Role Based Access Control in the ElasticSearch cluster.\n\nFor example, we want to restrict Dify to creating indices named according to a certain format.\n\nIndices should be named `dify_<workspace>_<knowledge_name>_<uuid>`\n\nWe can then restrict the ElasticSearch user that Dify uses to only read/write access to indices named `dify_*`\n\nThis is important for multi-tenant vector stores where Dify is not the only tenant. We must avoid Dify having access to non-Dify indices and prevent other applications from overwriting Dify-created indicies.\n\n\n\n### 2. Additional context or comments\n\nI am running Dify v1.6.0 on Kubernetes and using ElasticSearch as a vector store using these env configuration in my [helm chart by Boris Polonsky](https://github.com/BorisPolonsky/dify-helm)\n\n```yaml\nextraEnv:\n  - name: VECTOR_STORE\n    value: \"elasticsearch\"\n  - name: ELASTICSEARCH_HOST\n    value: \"https://<redacted>\"\n  - name: ELASTICSEARCH_USERNAME\n    value: \"elasticsearch_user\"\n  - name: ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD\n    value: \"<redacted>\"\n  - name: ELASTICSEARCH_PORT\n    value: \"9200\"\n```\n\n### 3. Can you help us with this feature?\n\n- [x] I am interested in contributing to this feature.",

We don't have an explicit check on npm version but the implicit is that use the one that is shipped with node.

Lets reuse the checks we have today. Thanks!", "Shouldn't there be an upper bound on the node version as well? The current check only checks for a minimum version required.

All the isolated places where the version is maintained can be unified to have a single source of truth for the node version.\n\nThe engines field can be used by both [workflows](https://github.com/actions/setup-node/blob/main/docs/advanced-usage.md#node-version-file) and code: `import { engines } from \"../../package.json\"`.", "Thanks for working on this!\nI???d like to get involved???are there any guidelines or examples for contributing to this part of the codebase?\nI???ve read the ???How to Contribute??? guide, but if you have any tips specific to editing the engines field or best practices for aligning version management (as discussed above), I???d love to learn more" ],

      "url" : "https://github.com/grafana/alloy/issues/3333",
      "repositoryName" : "grafana/alloy",
      "description" : "### Request\n\nThe `stage.json` Loki processing stage uses JMESPath to extract values from an incoming JSON message. JMESPath does not support any way to remove keys by name in its output. I'm proposing to develop a new process stage, `stage.json_drop` with the ability to drop keys from a JSON object.\n\nGiven the following JSON entry  and `loki.process`, the output would be as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"message\": \"Hello world !\", \"id\": \"0xdeadbeef\", \"kubernetes\": {\"namespace\": \"default\"}}\n```\n\n```alloy\nloki.process \"process\" {\n  stage.json_drop {\n     drop = [\"id\", \"kubernetes\"] // Remove selected top-level keys before forwarding the entry\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```txt\nLog:  {\"message\": \"Hello world !\"}\n```\n\n### Use case\n\nI'm using Grafana Alloy to read messages coming from a Kafka topic, select the relevant informations in the message to craft a log entry, set correct labels and structured metadata, then forward to Loki. \n\nThe Kafka messages are produced by Fluentbit running in Kubernetes clusters that collects pod logs in the ECS format. The ECS format adds data in the JSON object that varies for all services emitting logs in that format. \n\n<details><summary>Shape of such message: </summary>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"@metadata\": { //filebeat metadata },\n  \"@timestamp\": \"//UTC ISO Timestamp\",\n  \"agent\": { //filebeat metadata },\n  \"ecs\": { //ECS Reference },\n  \"host\": { // Host where filebeat runs  },\n  \"fields\": { // extra fields data from filebeat  },\n  \"input\": { // Filebeat metadata },\n  \"kubernetes\": { // Kubernetes metadata, with container/deployment/podLabels/nodeLabels/Namespace...  },\n  \"log\": { // Logger metadata },\n  // \n  \"message\": \"// Actual log message without structure or data\",\n  \"span\": { // Span ID structured\n    \"id\": \"0000000000\"\n  },\n  \"trace\": { // Trace ID structured\n    \"id\": \"0000000000\"\n  },\n  \"http\": { // Actual log informations  },\n  \"foo\": { // Many various keys could be here }\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\nFor my use case, if the `stage.json` could drop keys, I would be able to forward the Kafka message directly to Loki in JSON format after removing all the noise. Since I don't know all the keys that could be added to the JSON, I am stuck selecting a finite set of keys to create a log entry via template.\n\nI am also sure that there are other uses beyond my case for dropping a JSON key during a pipeline step. \n\n**Additional**\n[Grafana Forums Thread](https://community.grafana.com/t/how-to-remove-items-from-extracted-json-map-in-grafana-alloy-before-forwarding-to-loki/119993)",

This breaks Pydantic validation and causes all tools to disappear from the Tools page.\n\nTo fix it, check your tool metadata (YAML files for built-in tools, or database entries for custom/API tools) and make sure every i18n object has a valid, non-null string for `en_US`???even an empty string is acceptable. After correcting any missing or null values, restart your backend.\n\nRecent changes to i18n files in Dify 1.6.0 may have introduced this issue, so it's worth reviewing any recent updates to your tool definitions or translations as well??[cite](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/21459).\n\nIf you have a lot of tools, consider writing a quick script to scan for missing or null `en_US` fields in your tool configs before restarting. This should resolve the validation error and restore the Tools page.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

Fork and star :star: the CuPy repository :wink:\r\n\r\n1. Pick a function you want to work on from any of the modules listed above. You can find the function in the [SciPy API Reference](https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/reference/index.html) to understand what should be implemented. If you want to work on new modules (\uD83E\uDD5A), first discuss with us on this issue.\r\n\r\n1. Implement a function in your branch. If you need help, join [Gitter](https://gitter.im/cupy/community) or just ask for help in this issue.\r\n\r\n1. Don't forget to write a test code!\r\n\r\n1. Build CuPy and run tests to confirm that the function runs fine:\r\n  `pip install -e . && pytest tests/cupyx_tests/scipy_tests/PATH_TO_YOUR_TEST`\r\n   See the [Contribution Guide](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/latest/contribution.html#unit-testing) for details.\r\n\r\n1. Submit a pull-request to the `main` branch.\r\n\r\nNote that you will need a GPU environment to develop CuPy.\r\n\r\nSee also: NumPy API Tracker Issue #6078",

I want to run the permutation test on this large array, and it's taking minutes for as few as 1k permutations...

It's easy to make it work with CuPy, but we're waiting until there is an answer that works for several array API libraries.
