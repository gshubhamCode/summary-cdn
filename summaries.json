This probably requires some planning and decisions (e.g. QASM2 vs QASM3). We can discuss more during a Mitiq call.", "Can someone lay out the value prop for this? From my understanding very few users are writing openqasm by hand, and many frontends can import/export from openqasm easily.", "I don't see a clear one now that I've looked into it more. But maybe @andreamari or @nathanshammah had something in mind? My initial thought was that it would be useful if Mitiq aims to eventually support people who want to apply mitigation methods involving sub-gate-level control, who might be working directly in QASM, and if QASM submodules would be the best way for Mitiq to implement those methods internally. But I see now this would be a huge undertaking, and I don't even know if it's a plausible scenario.", "QASM(2) is a [very popular](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRjda57eKp7sLZENSJ7x83To2r0ja7XmW5sYaEobmYlvDKw122gagKm1j_qYm820054VbpFL0zZGjug/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000&slide=id.g14d46be9347_0_101) intermediate representation for circuits . \r\n\r\nSupporting QASM would make Mitiq easy to use with any software library that is able to export QASM circuits and any backend that is able to run QASM circuits. \r\n\r\n**Short term value prop:**\r\nIt would simplify the code of the user.\r\nE.g., if Mitiq supported QASM as a fronted, there would be no need to manually convert circuits to Cirq in the [BSQkit tutorial](https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/bqskit.html).\r\nMitiq would do it internally.  So no fundamental advantages, just more user-friendly. \r\n\r\n**Long term value prop:**\r\nIn the long term, Mitiq could act directly on some fixed and unique intermediate representation (e.g. QASM2, QASM3 or QIR). This would  imply rewriting almost all the code of Mitiq which is instead Cirq-based, but it has some clear potential advantages. \r\n\r\nIn practice, in my opinion, adding now QASM as a Mitiq frontend is perhaps not a super urgent issue but I see some short-term utility and some long-term potential.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "Forgot to add this comment last week:\n\nCirq 1.6 appears to support OpenQASM 3.0. https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/48aadd033de005773c6f6374492b1fe48d40dfd3/cirq-core/cirq/circuits/circuit.py#L1344\n\nHowever, Mitiq is not yet compatible with this version of Cirq. \n\nhttps://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq/blob/b2de86a046a84211b4fce52994fdad7820939405/requirements/requirements-cirq.txt#L4", "@purva-thakre the latest version of Cirq that is released is 1.4.1, which is already supported by Mitiq.", "> [@purva-thakre](https://github.com/purva-thakre) the latest version of Cirq that is released is 1.4.1, which is already supported by Mitiq.\n\n@cosenal Yes, thanks for pointing this out. This new compatibility is scheduled for a future release i.e. Cirq 1.6. I came across some comments regarding this in the cirq repo last week. ~I can't find them right now. Will update later~. \n\nEdit: \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/030dc9b8-4b1c-4e79-a023-1284e15e125c)\n\nhttps://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/48aadd033de005773c6f6374492b1fe48d40dfd3/dev_tools/notebooks/isolated_notebook_test.py#L47", "If you wanted to just use `[qbraid.transpiler.transpile](https://docs.qbraid.com/sdk/user-guide/transpiler)`, you could support OpenQASM out of the box, as [UCC does](https://github.com/unitaryfoundation/ucc/blob/de56fbc22838b75c2d67b06c6f76678a8d705c66/ucc/compile.py#L3).

The simplest solution to this issue, IMO, is to add `str` to the potential `QPROGRAM` types, then use cirq's QASM importer ([`cirq.contrib.qasm_import.circuit_from_qasm`](https://quantumai.google/cirq/build/interop#importing_from_openqasm)) to convert the QASM to cirq. Once it's in cirq, do QEM, then export back to QASM with [`cirq.qasm`](https://quantumai.google/cirq/build/interop#exporting_cirqcircuit_to_qasm_format).\n\nIf this process works (always some unknown unknowns), I don't necessarily see where qbraid could help, unless we are talking a much large refactor to have all of mitiqs conversions go through qbraid.", "If you didn't want to add qbraid conversions to all quantum circuits, you could add str as an accepted QPROGRAM type, and if a given program is a string, try to run it through `qbraid.transpile(circuit, 'cirq')` to convert to cirq and back to qasm `qbraid.transpile('qasm')`. \n\nBut if you did want to just use `qbraid` to do all your conversions, that might save you  maintenance headache in the long-run (though indeed as you say it would require a much larger refactor in the immediate term).

Since ProbeRunner already stores this reference internally, this integration would be straightforward.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> We should prioritize implementing **initialize** first, as it's the more critical of the two. The finalize callback can be addressed in a follow-up PR.\n\n## Example\n\nHere’s a snippet of code that would be moved into the initialize callback of the `isWeakCrypto` probe:\n\n```js\nthis.tracer = new VariableTracer()\n  .enableDefaultTracing()\n  // ↓↓↓ this part\n  .trace(\"crypto.createHash\", {\n    followConsecutiveAssignment: true, moduleName: \"crypto\"\n  });\n```\n\nWe don't need to trace `crypto.createHash` if the isWeakCrypto probe is not used.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e7dca6f-1881-423b-9fb1-ab8c55736a7a)",

It would be helpful if you can guide and share some reference about this issue.\n\nHi @00thirdeye00 - `getc(FILE *stream)` shouldn't be too difficult.\n\nFrom a very high level, it should be as simple as \n1. lock the fdtable entry associated with `stream` (and verify that it is valid)\n2. read a character and report it back, or `EOF` if there is an error.\n3. unlock the fdtable entry\n\nDo we still have `zvfs_read()` or was that reverted?

If it's going to be shared by other libc then probably `lib/libc/common`\n\n> And the definition would be `int getc(FILE* stream);`\n\nYes, you can read more about the definition here: https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/io/fgetc\n\n> * It sounds like that `FILE` handle could be possibly either file or UART handle?\n\nAnything that can be read from or written to can be abstracted as a 'FILE'\n\n", "Sounds good." ],

Currently is not possible through neither `,` nor `;`\r\n\r\nConsider the same request for Interfaces, Enums and .properties (it at `src/main/resources` and `src/test/resources`)\r\n\r\nOf course considering that all these types should be created within the same package.\r\n\r\nThanks for your understanding.",

This is a similar issue to [this one](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/128475) which seems to be caused by LLVM 19 making `reference-types` a default feature (see thread [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/128511)).\n\nThis issue is [fixed](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/javy/pull/896) in upstream javy, and I have checked it works by branching nanvix/javy, rebasing to `v5.0.4` and running the tests locally.\n\nWe basically just need to rebase `nanvic/javy` to `v5.0.4`, but I wanted to open this issue first. (Also opening a PR for a rebase would not work very well neither).\n\ncc @ppenna @danbugs ",

Initially, verify the email address, which should proceed smoothly. \r\n- Next, attempt to verify the phone number, Despite the successful verification of the email address, the system incorrectly indicates that the user is unverified when verifying the phone number. \r\n- In an attempt to rectify this inconsistency, proceed to unverify the phone number. Unexpectedly, the system now displays an alert indicating that the user is verified, contradicting the initial indication of being unverified.\n\n### \uD83D\uDC4D Expected behavior\n\n- When the user hits **Verify Phone**, the alert should confirm that the `user is verified`.\r\n- When the user hits **Unverify Phone**, the alert should confirm that the `user is unverified`.\n\n### \uD83D\uDC4E Actual Behavior\n\nWhen attempting to **verify the phone numbe**r, an alert incorrectly states that the `user is unverified`. \r\nHowever, when attempting to **unverify the phone**, the system incorrectly indicates that the `user is verified.`\n\n### \uD83C\uDFB2 Appwrite version\n\nVersion 1.4.x\n\n### \uD83D\uDCBB Operating system\n\nWindows\n\n### \uD83E\uDDF1 Your Environment\n\n_No response_\n\n### \uD83D\uDC40 Have you spent some time to check if this issue has been raised before?\n\n- [X] I checked and didn't find similar issue\n\n### \uD83C\uDFE2 Have you read the Code of Conduct?\n\n- [X] I have read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/appwrite/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)",

But I also don't want the alert notification to be obnoxious, so that I can retain my focus.\n\nSome ideas for a better UX:\n- Make the recurring events darker (using the same colors as the events in the past). This will help prevent the problem of the user trying to make an edit in the first case.\n- Replace the regular `alert()` with a toast (use `react-toastify`, which we already use in the `SomedayEventForm`)\n\n### Use Case\n\nThis'll help users still see all their events while also making it less punitive when they naturally attempt to edit a recurring event.\n\n### Additional Context\n\nWe currently only support viewing recurring events in Compass; we do not support making a change to a recurring event (yet). \n\n\nThe current UX:\n\n<img width=\"1914\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9a8d676-f938-4881-bc71-9bfd4f4321f5\" />",

It has so much text that it\n\t\t\tdoesn't fit on one line. Wow! So much text!\n\t\t</>\n\t);\n}\n```\n\nIs currently fixed to the following invalid syntax:\n```javascript\nexport function Example() {\n\treturn (\n\t\t\"This is a fragment with lots of text in it. It has so much text that it\n\t\t\tdoesn't fit on one line. Wow! So much text!\"\n\t);\n}\n```\n\nIn my opinion, a multi-line fragment like this is _not_ useless and this rule should not even apply in this case. If the rule does apply it should probably collapse the whitespace here.\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow Biome's Code of Conduct",

This is particularly helpful when it comes to port existing FastAPI applications to MCP. Furthermore, the same dependency injection pattern cannot be replicated with a plain FastMCP server, because it's not part of the SDK, and because the lifespan of FastAPI and FastMCP appications works differently: while the former is bound to the server, the latter is bound to the tool request.\n", "+1", "+1 please" ],

Currently the runtime will attempt to construct the model component using the provided `params` and only if an error occurs do we propagate it to the user. This is both:\n 1. An expensive feedback cycle (e.g. an error occurs after downloading model weights).\n 2. An vector for poor DX back to the user when parameters are incorrect, invalid or missing.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nSee how data components handle params by being explicit. E.g. [DuckDB](https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai/blob/9d07bce21d9d3ca1904d7ff7afa89cbbcda5b69c/crates/runtime/src/dataconnector/flightsql.rs#L68-L72). Helper struct/utilities [here](https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai/blob/trunk/crates/runtime/src/parameters.rs). \n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nThe current implementation is a feasible working alternative. Improving error message handling in the current paradigm is possible, but requires handling many issues from underlying causes instead of validating parameters explicitly first.\n",

      "description" : "### Is your feature request related to a problem?\n\n- [x] Yes, it is related to a problem\n\n### Describe the feature you'd like\n\n## \uD83C\uDF1F Feature Description\nMigrate the web search functionality from Tavily Search to DuckDuckGo Search.\n\n## \uD83D\uDD0D Problem Statement\nThe current implementation of the web search feature relies on the Tavily Search API. This feature is utilized in the `handle_web_search_node` to perform web searches. The `TavilySearchTool` class in `backend/app/agents/devrel/tools/search_tool.py` directly interacts with the Tavily API. The dependency on Tavily is also specified in the project's dependencies. This migration is intended to replace Tavily Search with DuckDuckGo Search as the primary web search provider.\n\n## \uD83C\uDFAF Expected Outcome\nUpon completion, the project will use DuckDuckGo Search for all web search queries. The `langchain-tavily` and `tavily-python` dependencies will be removed from the project, and a new dependency for a DuckDuckGo search library will be added. The `handle_web_search_node` and the search tool will be updated to use the new DuckDuckGo search functionality.\n\n## \uD83D\uDCF7 Screenshots and Design Ideas\nN/A (This is a backend implementation change with no direct UI impact).\n\n## \uD83D\uDCCB Additional Context\nThe following files will be impacted by this change:\n- `backend/app/agents/devrel/tools/search_tool.py`: The `TavilySearchTool` class will need to be replaced with a new class for DuckDuckGo search.\n- `backend/app/agents/devrel/nodes/handle_web_search_node.py`: The `handle_web_search_node` will need to be updated to use the new DuckDuckGo search tool.\n- `pyproject.toml`: The `langchain-tavily` and `tavily-python` dependencies will be removed and a new dependency for DuckDuckGo search will be added.\n- `backend/app/core/config.py`: The `tavily_api_key` setting will be removed and a new setting for the DuckDuckGo API key may need to be added.\n\n### Record\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\n- [ ] I want to work on implementing this feature",

      "repositoryName" : "ONEARMY/community-platform",
      "description" : "> Do you have attention to detail and would like to work on making the UI nicer? This issue is then for you! :))\n\n## Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.\n1. Comment section is still not matching the designs. The whitespace is lacking between the nested comments and the visually it looks tight, packed and overwhelming.\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6340e9d-7671-4308-acd0-10bf42bffd4b)\n\n2. Additionally the comment on mobile has spacing from the left, leaving the space not being utilised and making the text unnecessarily squeezed.\n<img width=\"361\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28e206b7-fbe6-471c-a2c4-8f09b1284eeb\" />\n\nEspecially with nested comments it becomes obvious:\n<img width=\"361\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86610c32-e365-414c-868e-02621ca54564\" />\n\n3. If the comment has some enters for new line and the the Show more button shows, it creates an awkward space. There is also gap applied.\n<img width=\"918\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a76486ea-e490-4860-940e-c49498ebeb1e\" />\n\n## Describe the solution you'd like\n\nGenerally I think this will need not only adjusting the numbers, but some minor restructuring of the divs. So, let me try to number the improvements:\n\n---\n\n1. Improving the spacings between the nested comments. In the designs there are also the useful buttons in each comment, that are not yet implemented. In the design however, the spacing occurs naturally because of the useful buttons, so I did not need to add a big margin-bottom. I will leave the solution here up to you, but account for the fact that one day in the future we will introduce the useful button for the comment.\n<img width=\"670\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00f1a492-0cfe-4a26-a6d4-a25e9f1e81d2\" />\n\nDon't be afraid to be generous with the spacings, in the devtools i tried 50px as in my designs\n<img width=\"978\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f23db889-05ba-4607-bedc-25d4a4abc321\" />\n\n---\n\n2. Mobile improvement. Here I upload a gif of the solution that I utilised in the Figma designs - it was to hide the left column with the avatar, allowing the text to stretch and then showing the avatar next to the username in 30x30px size.\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/329f7267-8bdb-4d18-a47c-73b7e44d5478)\n\nDon't forget to make sure that the author's badge is working \n<img width=\"502\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b3012c1-567c-4e5e-b781-5f81852bbe28\" />\n\n\n---\n\n3. Putting the Show More button directly under the comment, trimming the whitespaces. \n<img width=\"947\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c07017f7-60f7-4c1c-92f4-859c1267736f\" />\n\n\n---\n\n4. Decreasing the gap here to 5px from 10px\n<img width=\"404\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a1c56f9-11f3-4bd0-9e52-239948b15c2f\" />\n\n\n\n---\n\n5. As you can see, on mobile it gets quite tight. I would suggest removing the word Published from the \"Published x time ago\" information for the comments.\n<img width=\"322\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe06174a-b402-452b-a18b-eefd38b03192\" />\n\n\n---\n\n6. OPTIONAL - In case you would want to act on the point 5. above even more, I would suggest for mobile screens shortening the formulation even more, saying for example 1h ago, 3mo ago or 2yr ago. Reddit does it this way as well.\n\n<img width=\"182\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c194f4c-a4ee-42a1-9c59-dcd5c6b77e42\" />\n\n---\n\n7. OPTIONAL - In case you would still be up for a challenge, having these 2 aligned on the baseline would be a nice achievement, however I didn't manage to get the desired result, since as you can see below, the align-items:baseline does not align them.\n<img width=\"742\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27968c77-de84-400a-8d3f-22e88b37b627\" />\n\n\n\n##  Additional context - [FIGMA FILE HERE](https://www.figma.com/design/XYV3fr8UVOdkNyBmKHHR7f/CP---Comments-Useful---Mobile?node-id=48-79)\nYou can find the figma file above. You can see the components, the desktop and the mobile versions. These design include the correct answer feature or the useful buttons, which are not yet implemented, so feel free to ignore those.\n\n<img width=\"761\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/119c7345-44cf-4baa-9ef6-feed6a05d7ad\" />\n\nIf you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask. :))",

      "description" : "There is an opportunity to DRY by refactoring part of the `APIGateway`, `APIGatewayV2`, and `APIGateway+WebSocket` payload.\n\nAs per my assistant: \n\n--- \n### 1. HTTP Headers and Body Handling\n- Properties like `headers`, `multiValueHeaders` (or just `headers` in V2), and `body`, as well as `isBase64Encoded`, appear in all major APIGateway request/response structs:\n  - `APIGatewayRequest`\n  - `APIGatewayV2Request`\n  - `APIGatewayWebSocketRequest`\n  - Their corresponding response types.\n\n### 2. Context/Identity Structures\n- Each request type defines a nested `Context` struct (sometimes with further nesting like `Identity` or `HTTP`), which contains information about the caller, API, stage, request IDs, etc.\n- Many fields in these context structs overlap, such as `apiId`, `stage`, `requestId`, `domainName`, and `sourceIp`.\n\n### 3. Codable/Sendable Conformance\n- All these types conform to `Codable` (and, where supported, `Sendable`).\n\n### 4. CodingKeys Mapping\n- Several structs use custom `CodingKeys` enums to map from JSON input to struct properties, especially for context/requestContext fields.\n\n### 5. Response Struct Pattern\n- The response structs (`APIGatewayResponse`, `APIGatewayV2Response`, and by alias, `APIGatewayWebSocketResponse`) all follow a similar pattern: `statusCode`, `headers`, `body`, and `isBase64Encoded`, with slight variations.\n\n---\n\n### Candidates for Code Sharing/Abstraction\n- **Protocols:** Define a protocol for common properties (headers, body, isBase64Encoded) and have each struct conform to it.\n  ```swift\n  protocol APIGatewayRequestCommon: Codable {\n      var headers: HTTPHeaders? { get }\n      var body: String? { get }\n      var isBase64Encoded: Bool? { get }\n  }\n  ```\n- **Shared Context/Identity Structs:** Refactor common context/identity fields into base structs or protocols, and compose them in each specific context struct as needed.\n- **Initializers/Decoding Helpers:** Shared extensions or helper initializers to reduce repeated decoding logic for commonly structured properties.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table of Common Properties:**\n\n| Property         | APIGatewayRequest | APIGatewayV2Request | APIGatewayWebSocketRequest |\n|------------------|------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|\n| headers          | ✓                | ✓                   | ✓                          |\n| multiValueHeaders| ✓                | (V2 drops this)     | ✓                          |\n| body             | ✓                | ✓                   | ✓                          |\n| isBase64Encoded  | ✓                | ✓                   | ✓                          |\n| context/requestContext| ✓           | ✓                   | ✓ (as `context`)           |\n| stage            | ✓ (in context)   | ✓ (in context)      | ✓ (in context)             |\n| apiId            | ✓ (in context)   | ✓ (in context)      | ✓ (in context)             |\n| requestId        | ✓ (in context)   | ✓ (in context)      | ✓ (in context)             |\n| domainName       | ✓ (in context)   | ✓ (in context)      | ✓ (in context)             |\n| sourceIp         | ✓ (in context)   | ✓ (in context)      | ✓ (in context.identity)    |\n\n",

If one wants to delete more than one table from the library, one can select multiple tables by pressing STRG while clicking. All selected tables are highlighted in light blue color. On right clicking one of the selected tables the highlighting changes to a light gray and the right-clicked table get sourrounded by a blue sqare. In the context menue one can select to delete the table. Only the blue surrounded table gets deleted, not all previously selected tables as exprected.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**\r\n\r\n1. Copy multiple tables to work library (proc copy in=sashelp out=work; select cars class; run)\r\n2. Go to \"LIBRARIES\" pane and select the work library\r\n3. Hold STRG and left-click both just copied tables\r\n4. Righ-click the just selected tables and select Delete from the context menue\r\n5. Only one table is deleted instead of all selected tables\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nAll selected tables are deleted at the same time. Ideally there would be a confirmation question about deleting multipe tables\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/177488ed-56fd-41e1-ad23-5933c63ee697)\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\nClient OS:  Windows 11\r\nExtension version: 1.10.2\r\nSAS version: Viya 2024.03\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n",

I don't think this is documented anywhere. Here are the main steps:\n\n1\\. First compile the dependency module with `mymodule.swift -emit-library -o /path/to/mymodule.dylib -emit-module-path /path/to/swiftmoduledir/`.  \n2. Compile the executable with `swiftc mymainmodule.swift -emit-object -o /path/to/mymainmodule.o -I /path/to/swiftmoduledir/`  \n3. Link with `swiftc /path/to/mymainmodule.o /path/to/mymodule.dylib -emit-executable -o /path/to/myexe`  \n4. Run the executable normally, or optionally with the new runtime `env DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/libswiftCore.dylib /path/to/myexe`.\n\nOn Linux, the file suffixes would be different (do we support dynamic linking on Linux?), and I imagine replacing DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH with LD_LIBRARY_PATH should just work.\n\nYou can also import a module directory (i.e. containing a `module.modulemap`) with `-I`, or directly import a header `-import-objc-header`.\n\nWe should probably document some examples of invoking swiftc in the help page (right now, it has no examples ❗), and this could be the final example (and the most complicated one). the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH bit is for development, so it's not super clear where we should write that down, but it's not necessarily obvious to a contributor that the locally built compiler compiler links in the OS runtime by default and not the locally built one.\n\nOne potential idea is to have simple example in `--help`, which would a subset of a new document under the `docs/` directory. We can link the document from the `--help` page, so someone can follow it in case they want more complicated examples. The DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH \"trick\" can go into the doc without going into the `--help` information. If we create this new doc, we should also link it from `docs/DebuggingTheCompiler.md`.\n\n\n   ",

So, my guess is that `distil-large-v3` is not the right name. Also, where do I download the tokenizer for a given model?\n\nI suggest downloading all the models by `make download-models`. It will result in download locally all the models in `Model` folder. \nNext, you have to copy the folder of the model you want to embed inside xcode project. Make sure to copy and not reference the folder, and also select the proper target (your app) on copying the folder. \n\nAlso be sure that the model folder (or any other hierarchy you have in mind) is a _folder_ and not a _group_. This will lead to copying the model folder in the main bundle exactly as it is in your Xcode project hierarchy, and so having the model folder embedded in the main Bundle. \n\nThen something like the example below should work. \n\n```\nlet modelPath = Bundle.main.path(forResource: $PATH_TO_MODEL_FOLDER, ofType: nil)!\nwhisperKit = try await WhisperKit(\n                model: \"tiny\",\n                modelFolder: Bundle.main.path(forResource: modelPath, ofType: nil)!,\n                //omitted options\n\n                download: false\n            )\nlogger.info(\"WhisperKit initialized successfully\")\n```\n\nI've not fully tested, but it seems to load the model properly. Keep in mind that there are limitations on the bundle size to publish the app, so choose the model to embed also based on this\n\n", "Using code similar to the one you provided, I was able to get local models to work. However, I am struggling to get the tokenizer to load locally. Here is the code I am using:\n\n```\nguard let modelFolder = Bundle.main.url(forResource: self.modelFolder, withExtension: nil, subdirectory: nil) else {\n            whisperKitError = \"Could not find model folder\"\n            return\n        }\n        \n        guard let tokenizerFolder = Bundle.main.url(forResource: self.tokenizerFolder, withExtension: nil, subdirectory: nil) else {\n            whisperKitError = \"Could not find tokenizer folder\"\n            return\n        }\n        \n        let computeOptions = ModelComputeOptions(melCompute: .cpuAndGPU, audioEncoderCompute: .cpuAndGPU, textDecoderCompute: .cpuAndGPU, prefillCompute: .cpuAndGPU)\n        let whisperKitConfiguration = WhisperKitConfig(model: \"tiny.en\", modelFolder: modelFolder.absoluteString, tokenizerFolder: tokenizerFolder, /*computeOptions: computeOptions,*/ verbose: true, logLevel: .debug, download: false)\n        \n\n        do {\n            print(\"Initializing WhisperKit\")\n            self.whisperKit = try await WhisperKit(whisperKitConfiguration)\n            whisperKitError = \"\"\n            print(\"WhisperKit Initialized\")\n            print(\"Model folder: \\(whisperKit?.modelFolder)\")\n            print(\"Tokenizer folder: \\(whisperKit?.tokenizerFolder)\")\n        } catch {\n            whisperKitError = error.localizedDescription\n            print(whisperKitError)\n        }\n```\n\nBoth folders exist, but it is still loading the tokenizer from the HF Hub, but failing to save it, as shown in this screenshot, which makes me think that tokenizerFolder specifies where to save a downloaded tokenizer. If I don't provide `tokenizerFolder`, it downloads it from the hub (except when it is already cached). \n<img width=\"654\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c155dea-3bd8-470f-9eae-8f3b608b005c\" />\n\nFor reference, here is what my folder structure looks like:\n\n<img width=\"354\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16574301-34a1-4f70-891a-52dc128c2482\" />\n\nNaturally, I inspected the underlying code and after adding a line of logging to the WhisperKit source code found that it was looking for my tokenizer files in:\n```\n/Models/tokenizers/whisper-tiny.en/models/openai/whisper-tiny.en/tokenizer.json\n\n```\n\nThis is from `ModelUtilities.swift`\n\n```\nlet tokenizerName = tokenizerNameForVariant(pretrained)\nlet hubApi = HubApi(downloadBase: tokenizerFolder, useBackgroundSession: useBackgroundSession)\n\n// Attempt to load tokenizer from local folder if specified\nlet resolvedTokenizerFolder = hubApi.localRepoLocation(HubApi.Repo(id: tokenizerName))\nlet tokenizerConfigPath = resolvedTokenizerFolder.appendingPathComponent(\"tokenizer.json\")\n      \nLogging.debug(\"Looking for tokenizer.json at \\(tokenizerConfigPath.path)\")\n```\n\nSo, it was adding `models/openai/whisper-tiny.en/tokenizer.json` to whatever folder I gave it. Which I found counterintuitive since `modelFolder` checks the exact folder I give it.\n\nThis leads me to ask, what is the appropriate folder structure for the tokenizers and models? Is there a way for me to provide a folder with say all the models (ignoring bundle size) and a folder with all the tokenizer models and just tell WhisperKit which model I want and WhisperKit will automatically pull the appropriate files? \n\nI could not find any documentation for any of this behavior and I was just wondering if it would be useful for me to create some documentation for using models completely offline and put it on this repository. Also, I think to help users debug in the future, it is useful to keep `Logging.debug(\"Looking for tokenizer.json at \\(tokenizerConfigPath.path)\")`. Should I create a PR for it? I also just wanted to bring up that `.path` has been deprecated in favor of `.path(percentEncoded: Bool)`\n", "This is good feedback for the library, the tokenizer handling is divergent enough from the model handling that it would be great to have a unified process that respects the config as expected. Would be awesome to see a PR with the changes that would fit your use case!\n \n- Zach" ],

I guess in theory if we're really careful about the lookup logic (and the KVStore is async) we could do the loading in parallel (though its still a few more requests) but we'd still have to wait on compaction (without a background-compaction task running, which would require a generic `spawn` method...). Seems much easier to just check the length and skip some code for the common case :)", "If I understand it correctly, this is special casing for channels at the beginning of their life and when they grow, the node will switch over to persisting updates and compaction anyway?\n\nTo me it isn't quite clear if this is really worth it. If the hit is significant, it is also a problem when the channel has outgrown the 'small' stage anyway?", "> If I understand it correctly, this is special casing for channels at the beginning of their life and when they grow, the node will switch over to persisting updates and compaction anyway?\n\nYes.\n\n> To me it isn't quite clear if this is really worth it. If the hit is significant, it is also a problem when the channel has outgrown the 'small' stage anyway?\n\nIts more a recognition of two very different cases - if you're running an \"edge node\" that is just a wallet making occasional payments, then you're likely to never hit the \"large\" stage, and thus avoiding the compaction overhead is a really nice optimization. If you're a larger node that is forwarding/processing many payments, you're very likely to hit the \"large\" stage and the compaction penalty is worth it to avoid the writes.", "At what size would the \"large\" stage be entered then typically and how many htlcs/channel updates is that? A channel monitor of a few kb, that doesn't sound like all that many updates?", "Yea, dunno, we'd have to figure that out. I imagine most mobile nodes probably make in the 100s to low 1000s of payments in their entire lifetime, probably fewer on a single channel once you consider splicing and the like. 10KiB or whatever should be plenty for 100 or 250 payments.", "> Its more a recognition of two very different cases\n\nIt sounds like if you wanted to make this automatic, the metric you'd really want to evaluate to switch this behavior isn't so much monitor size, as one of these:\n\n  - Frequency of updates to the channel\n  - Latency of updates to the channel (more difficult)\n\nThe monitor size is a decent reflection of the _number_ of updates to the channel[1], but with no perception of time it's impossible to evaluate whether it's being stored by a tenured edge node, or a routing node. I think if you took time into account, perhaps by using the block delta between the funding tx and chain tip to estimate update frequency, you could make a more informed assessment.\n\nHowever, I worry that automating the behavior selection is not really following the \"principle of least astonishment.\" \n\nI would think that routing nodes rarely move to the edge, and edge nodes rarely become routing nodes (more often, a routing node starts small and may appear like an edge). And furthermore, I know what my node is likely to be; especially if I'm a Lightning developer and managing this on behalf of users, such as in a mobile wallet.\n\nFor that matter, varying the behavior _per channel_ seems to make node persistence more difficult to reason about. Different channels could persist different ways on my node, depending on a size threshold. Which means they can change without me doing anything. I would think that if the reason for variation is the use case, then one behavior is correct for all channels stored by the node.\n\nIn that light, I'd just leave this a configurable behavior, which I think it is now.\n\n[1] I recognize that size is being used here to evaluate the storage write size, not the number of updates. But I think that is why the discussion is unclear. Compared to update count/frequency, it's much harder to know the storage configuration of a given node, and what the throughput/latency tradeoff is like.", "I think the intent of the proposed change is to optimize for the edge-node case with remote storage. Even an edge node may make enough payments to get a monitor up to 10s of KiB in size, at which point network-level effects like TCP slowstart may dominate the actual network latency. For a \"power-user\" edge node, we really want to use the `MonitorUpdatingPersister`, but paying the extra RTT cost of cleanup on load for every edge node is not a great tradeoff either.\n\nFor a routing node, it still seems to me like a size-based threshold may be something they want, purely as it (very marginally) reduces IO throughput for under-utilized or new channels. Writing out updates (padded to 4KiB or more depending on the storage medium) and then consolidating when the whole monitor is only a few KiB isn't really the right tradeoff no matter what. Of course a routing node is expected to surpass the threshold very quickly, so it shouldn't really make a substantial difference, but it seems strictly better to write out full updates in this case than not.\n\nIndeed, this does lead to a bit of behavior shift, but I think the important metrics wouldn't change - first of all, if you happened to look at storage right after compaction, the stored contents would be identical to a full monitor persistence so I wouldn't really say that this materially changes the way that logic would interact with the stored data (you already have to handle the case of having no in-flight updates!). It also shouldn't materially change the IO throughput or write count for any node, just a fairly marginal strict reduction for routing nodes with fresh channels.", "> At what size would the \"large\" stage be entered then typically and how many htlcs/channel updates is that? A channel monitor of a few kb, that doesn't sound like all that many updates?\n\nFor our probing node running ldk-node with network storage (EFS), at around 20,000 updates over the single channel the average probe duration starts to increase substantially. p75 starts to creep up after about 3,000.", "Do y'all have any further thoughts here, @domZippilli or @amackillop?", "> Do y'all have any further thoughts here, [@domZippilli](https://github.com/domZippilli) or [@amackillop](https://github.com/amackillop)?\n\nI see in the PR it's configurable. I think as long as that's the case, developers who don't want the variation in behavior can set the minimum size to `0`." ],

Possibly these libraries also come with a dynamic dropdown upon typing '@' that will suggest user names in the given person's project. \r\n- How exactly would you suggest handling invalid usernames? Ideally I'd validate before submitting and then show a form error to the user, such that they don't submit invalid username tags. Suggesting usernames will vastly help here, as mentioned above \r\n- Also, how would you like to store the details exactly before sending? Feel free to have a browse of our code first, that should help \r\n- Regarding sending the emails, content sounds great, and in terms of technical infrastructure you should be able to reuse what we already have, ie don't have to build email processing from scratch. Let me know if you have specific questions here! \r\n\r\nThanks, really excited for your contribution on this!!

Perhaps proximity to certain keywords in the same chunk or same document can be used. The `description` should make clear that it can't make perfect determinations. The `message` should be informative and should try not to confuse a user into making a wrong \"correction\".\n\n## Resources\n\n- [harwardcommunications](https://blog.harwardcommunications.com/2011/02/21/the-difference-between-damage-and-damages/)\n- [English StackExchange](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/29203/damage-vs-damages)\n- [Grammarphobia](https://www.grammarphobia.com/blog/2020/06/damage-damages.html)\n- [WordReference](https://forum.wordreference.com/threads/damage-or-damages.2588100/)\n- [Cambridge Dictionary \"damages\"](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/damages)\n- [Oxford Learners \"damage\" and \"damages\"](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/damage_1)\n- [Collins Dictionary \"damage\"](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/english-language-learning/damage)\n- [Collins Dictionary \"damages\"](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/english-language-learning/damages)\n- [Merriam-Webster Dictionary \"damage\" and \"damages\"](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/damage)\n\n## Examples\n\nExamples of the error from GitHub:\n- Flow networks robust against **damages** are simple model networks described in a series of publications by Kaluza et al.\n- POC to select vehicle **damages** on a car and mark the severity - sudheeshcm/vehicle-damage-selector.\n- This is a web application that detects **damages** on mangoes using a TensorFlow model with Django as the frontend framework\n- Detecting different types of **damages** of roads like cracks and potholes for the given image/video of the road.\n\nExamples from GitHub where it seems to be used correctly in regard to financial compensation:\n- Code used for calculating **damages** in lost chance cases.\n- Where the dispute involves a claim for damages in respect of a motor accident for cost of rental of a replacement vehicle\n- Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to\ndefend claims against the other Contributors related to those\nperformance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other\nContributor to pay any **damages** as a result, the Commercial Contributor\nmust pay those **damages**.\n\nExamples from GitHub where it's not an error but a verb:\n- Profiles pb's and **damages** them when their runtime goes over a set value - sirhamsteralot/HaE-PBLimiter.\n- Opening Wayland-native terminal **damages** Firefox\n- Open File Requester **damages** underlaying windows when moved\n\nExamples from GitHub that are too hard to call - maybe they are talking about financial compensation?\n- The goal is to estimate the **damages** of each link in the Graph object using the **Damages** result (estimating the **damages** for each segment of a Network).\n- This repository contains code to conduct statistical inference in cartel **damages** estimation.

It must be quite new.\n\n## Examples\n\n- Unretire Gretzky's sweater . **Brandish** him a traitor.\n- lied to stop kuma's ideology from taking root and to **brandish** him a criminal that they could arrest\n- he was so afraid his thoughts could **brandish** him as a paedophile\n- Chanel Oberlin's reason for purposely leading on Pete Martinez in order to humiliate him and **brandish** him a registered sex offender\n- ?? spoke out over the move by Kenyans to continuously **brandish** him with nicknames even after ...\n- **brandish** him as an acclaimed symbol of humility, integrity and incorruptibility in the face of today's corrupt economic and political elite1\n- To attempt to **brandish** him as an “illegal immigrant” is absolutely ridiculous and warrants an immediate retraction and apology.\n- The small minded townsfolk **brandish** him with the nickname \"Genepool\" due to his physical and cognitive shortcomings.\n- One such reason that critics **brandish** him with this label is due to Peterson's opposition to Canada's Bill C-16\n\n## Potential False Positives\n\nIt will take some effort to detect the original correct usage and separate it from this new incorrect usage.",

The problem with this approach is that this would also match any regular Firefox browser.\r\n\r\nThe only other way I could think of would be checking whether the user traffic originates from a Tor exit node IP, which would be more complex and require maintaining a list of node IPs.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts on how to proceed?", "Hi @sea-kelp, since this check will happen server-side, we can replace the User-Agent inspection with an IP-based check against the list of known Tor exit nodes.\nTor Project maintains an up-to-date list of public exit node IPs, which we can fetch and cache periodically. Then, on each request, we can compare the client’s IP against that list.", "> Tor Project maintains an up-to-date list of public exit node IPs, which we can fetch and cache periodically. Then, on each request, we can compare the client’s IP against that list.\n\nI'm thinking about taking a shot at implementing this. But my impression is this code will be running behind an onion service, and connections to onion services don't go through exit nodes. If both of those are correct we're back to the problem @sea-kelp described. ", "It's been a while, but I'm not sure that (checking for exit node IPs) would solve the underlying issue anyway even if the source interface wasn't a hidden service. The intent was to steer people towards Tor Browser on desktop and away from Android Tor Browser, or Brave, or other alternatives - all of those would still route their traffic over Tor. We did make some changes to detect and block the use Tor2Web proxies and such already.\n\nMaybe the real issue here is whether that assumption (mobile browser Tor bad, desktop browser Tor good) still holds true in 2025." ],

      "repositoryName" : "linkerd/linkerd2",
      "description" : "### What is the issue?\n\nThe helm chart allows a string or an int for `controller.podDisruptionBudget.maxUnavailable` and linkerd will happily deploy with, for example, either `1` or `25%` for this value and the PDBs are defined accordingly and correctly.  However, as soon as a pod starts up where `linkerd-proxy` needs to be inject, the following error will occur\r\n```\r\nadmission webhook \"linkerd-proxy-injector.linkerd.io\" denied the request: failed to unmarshal JSON from: /var/run/linkerd/config/values: error unmarshaling JSON: while decoding JSON: json: cannot unmarshal string into Go struct field PodDisruptionBudget.controller.podDisruptionBudget.maxUnavailable of type int\r\n```\r\nIt appears to be related to the strict typing in Go here: https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/blob/0965da659b75ee347269743e350347e92cb0d316/pkg/charts/linkerd2/values.go#L96.\r\n\r\nSince k8s allows for percentages for PDBs, it seems the go code should be fixed to allow the same.  Either way, if linkerd injection is going to fail if a percent is used in the helm chart values, linkerd should fail to deploy due to the same.\n\n### How can it be reproduced?\n\nDefine a PDB using a percent, deploy and then attempt to inject `linkerd-proxy`.\n\n### Logs, error output, etc\n\nSee initial description.\n\n### output of `linkerd check -o short`\n\n```\r\n% linkerd check -o short\r\nlinkerd-version\r\n---------------\r\n‼ cli is up-to-date\r\n    unsupported version channel: stable-2.14.10\r\n    see https://linkerd.io/2.14/checks/#l5d-version-cli for hints\r\n\r\ncontrol-plane-version\r\n---------------------\r\n‼ control plane and cli versions match\r\n    control plane running edge-24.10.4 but cli running stable-2.14.10\r\n    see https://linkerd.io/2.14/checks/#l5d-version-control for hints\r\n\r\nlinkerd-control-plane-proxy\r\n---------------------------\r\n‼ control plane proxies and cli versions match\r\n    linkerd-destination-6cfbc66dcf-rfqw7 running edge-24.10.4 but cli running stable-2.14.10\r\n    see https://linkerd.io/2.14/checks/#l5d-cp-proxy-cli-version for hints\r\n\r\nlinkerd-ha-checks\r\n-----------------\r\n‼ pod injection disabled on kube-system\r\n    kube-system namespace needs to have the label config.linkerd.io/admission-webhooks: disabled if injector webhook failure policy is Fail\r\n    see https://linkerd.io/2.14/checks/#l5d-injection-disabled for hints\r\n\r\nlinkerd-viz\r\n-----------\r\n‼ viz extension proxies and cli versions match\r\n    metrics-api-6ddbbd456-tmtdq running edge-24.10.4 but cli running stable-2.14.10\r\n    see https://linkerd.io/2.14/checks/#l5d-viz-proxy-cli-version for hints\r\n\r\nStatus check results are √\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Environment\n\n% kubectl version\r\nClient Version: v1.28.2\r\nKustomize Version: v5.0.4-0.20230601165947-6ce0bf390ce3\r\nServer Version: v1.29.8-eks-a737599\n\n### Possible solution\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Would you like to work on fixing this bug?\n\nNone",

As I understand it, actually supporting the \"%\" form is less important to you than having the chart and the CRD be consistent, correct?", "It would be ideal to be able to use % so we don't have to change the value for `maxUnavailable` as we increase or decrease the number of replicas.  However, if % isn't going to be supported at injection time, the helm chart should not support it either so it's more consistent with a \"fail-fast\" paradigm.", "This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity. It will be closed in 14 days if no further activity occurs. Thank you for your contributions.\n", "I would like to provide a fix for this issue. My idea is to change the maxUnavailable to type IntOrString, like for the [PodDisruptionBudget type](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/dc19f0b6b9cd14ece6b1929cb4e7ea2c9d322b95/pkg/apis/policy/types.go#L43). Why do you think about that @alpeb? \n\nAlso for testing, do I need to generate a new type of golden file and test to cover the % or is there a better alternative?", "Thanks for taking this on, @wim-de-groot! Unfortunately, `values.go` is a bit of debt in the codebase. It's been a challenge to keep this typed go struct in sync with the `values.yml` used by the Helm charts and by the chart rendering done by the Linkerd CLI.  The only reason we keep it around is because setting fields into a typed go struct is more ergonomic than setting fields (especially deeply nested fields) into an untyped `map[string]interface{}`.\n\nWith that said, there's actually nowhere in our go codebase that we specifically set `maxUnavailable` so I think we can sidestep this issue by making the `Controller` field of the `Values` struct at `map[string]interface{}`.  You can see that we do the same thing for  `DeploymentStrategy` and follow that as an example.\n\nUpdating an existing test or adding a new one where we set a % based PDB in the values would be a good way to test this." ],

This could be done through a progress bar, dots, or a step indicator, and the tracker should dynamically update as the user progresses through the form's pages/screens. The goal is to make the user's progress clear and easily understandable, ensuring a smooth experience.\n\n### Why Is This Important\n- A visual progress indicator helps users understand where they are in the form and how many steps remain, reducing confusion.\n- The progress UI needs to be accessible, ensuring all users, including those with disabilities, can easily understand and track their progress.\n- Clear tracking of progress increases user satisfaction by providing transparency and reducing anxiety about completing the form.\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Implement a visual indicator showing the user’s current step in the form (ex. progress bar, dots or step indicator).\n- [ ] Ensure the tracker dynamically updates as the user moves through application pages/screens.\n- [ ] Make the application progress UI accessible and easy to understand.\n- [ ] Design is consistent with [Techtonica's branding guidelines](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/sb8ppa0qxuuott515euei/h?rlkey=1ghfh6urkf2rakbonngk9z3bd&st=xcbpfn8v&dl=0), if the design is not yet existent\n     - make a proposal for design and behavior that is in keeping with the existing design choices\n     - document design choice decision in a comment on this issue as well as in https://github.com/Techtonica/techtonica.org/issues/505\n\n### Related Tickets\n- Main Issue:  #389 \n- #556\n\n### Additional Notes\nThe person working on this issue may need to collaborate with whoever is handling issue #556 to ensure that the progress tracker integrates smoothly with the multi-page UI and save progress functionality.\n\nthis work will need to be pulled from the `mvp` branch and merged into the `mvp` branch\n\n",

I encourage you and anyone else involved with this form project to read through UK's documentation on [Structuring forms](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/form-structure). In particular, pay attention to their \"one thing per page\" philosophy. We want to guide potential participants through the process as much as possible and not overwhelm them with text or fields.\n\n> This is an excellent opportunity to implement some conditional logic and cut down on the walls of eligibility text and form fields. A gender identity question can be used to quickly disqualify anyone whose gender identity does not line up with the eligibility requirements, saving them an immense amount of time on a form they do not need to fill out. If they answer with an eligible value, move them onto the rest of the form. If they answer with a non-eligible value, show them copy similar to this and send them off on their way.\n\nthis work will need to be pulled from the `mvp` branch and merged into the `mvp` branch",

It will increase the panel and require more scrolling for the page...but I think it's worth doing. ", "\nI could also argue that the safety spots callout should remain on unless the user decides to turn all callouts off. In the early days of Microsoft Soundscape, there used to be a toggle switch for the Location Updates callout, but starting around the early 2020's,the Location Updates callout became permanently turned on and cannot directly be configured by the user. My argument to leave safety spots on is so that the user is always aware of anything hazardous while walking around. That way the \"Manage Callouts\" menu wouldn't be cluttered with too many configurations. If we decide to go ahead with my solution, I also wrote a revision to the help documentation explaining \"Note: some callouts essential for safe navigation do not have their own toggle switch and can only be disabled with the \"Allow Callouts\" button.\" Anyway, having all three callouts in this section or just Transportation and Intersections will be an improvement, even for sighted users. The term Mobility isn't as intuitive for the average user.", "I can look into this ", "Do we know which files in the backend are connected to the different toggles that we want from the Mobility section?

Here's an example design of sections:\r\n- Cache engine config, including chunk size, a list of backends to use, caching policy, etc\r\n- List of backend configs for each backend listed in cache engine config. It should include the max size, eviction policy, serde, etc\r\n- Blend config: configurations for KV blending functionality\r\n- LMCache server config (optional), including the configurations for the lmcache_server module\r\n\r\nOn the implementation side, this proposal includes two parts: what's the format of configuration file, and what will the configuration class look like.\r\n- For configuration file: use [toml](https://toml.io/en/) instead of plain yaml to support different sections\r\n- For configuration class: have a separate config class for each section, and have a main `LMCacheConfig` class to include all those sections.\r\n",

MySQL client knows that you are not in an interactive terminal. `dolt sql` shell doesn't actually know this, and as a result the changes I made to the shell break lots of tests because where ever we stream in statements, we print out `Query OK` in many places that aren't expected in tests.\n\nThe equivalent dolt operations:\n```\n$ echo \"create table t (i int); drop table t;\" | dolt sql\n\n\n$ dolt sql\n# Welcome to the DoltSQL shell.\n# Statements must be terminated with ';'.\n# \"exit\" or \"quit\" (or Ctrl-D) to exit. \"\\help\" for help.\nmydb/main> create table t (i int);\nEmpty set (0.01 sec)\n\nmydb/main*>  drop table t;\nEmpty set (0.01 sec)\n\nmydb/main>\n```\n\nAs you can see, there are empty lines printed in the pipe case, and \"Empty Set\" returned in the shell case. The changes proposed by James in https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/pull/9291 and ultimately what claude tried to do don't toggle based on if the input is a pipe or interactive, and as a result will always print `Query OK` - which is not only confusing, but breaks my dolt tests which don't expect them to be there\n\nNext Steps:\n - Get `dolt sql` wise to the way it's being operated. This may require looking at the mysql shell code, or something else. One way or another we need to be aware of when printing these things makes sense.\n - Apply the SET change to GMS, and isolate it to fixing tests only in Dolt and Doltgres. Don't modify the shell output at this stage because it breaks a lot of tests and become intractable.\n -  Update the shell, in the way proposed by James, to get the right information out in the right context.\n\nIn some of these changes, we are going to want to toggle behavior with an environment flag such that we won't stop the development train with broken builds. We kind of need better options to optionally enable behaviors while also getting them in the pipeline for testing." ],

Even then, this implementation would be \"local\", e.g. not synced with the current AWS API limits. Granted, those API limits would probably not change very often, yet someone would need to keep this intermediate layer in sync.\r\n\r\nMy proposal would be the following:\r\n\r\n- For those who cannot test such things in non-production environments, validate the API limits that you want to validate by adding the respective input/variable validation logic to your config (https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/expressions/custom-conditions)\r\n- Otherwise, use your non-production environment(s) to test/validate this against the SSOCT (single source of **current** truth) - the real AWS API.", "Marking this issue as stale due to inactivity.

      "description" : "### Checklist\n\n- [x] I have checked [FAQs](https://github.com/fla-org/flash-linear-attention/blob/main/FAQs.md) and existing issues for similar problems\n- [x] My GPU is H100 and I have installed `triton-nightly` built by fla team, and double checked [FAQs](https://github.com/fla-org/flash-linear-attention/blob/main/FAQs.md)\n- [x] Please report this bug in English to ensure wider understanding and support\n\n### Describe the Bug\n\n1. A test was designed using the same input sequence, with two inference modes: the first involves a single full forward pass, while the second splits the sequence into multiple segments for sequential forward passes with manual cache transfer. The test checks whether the outputs of the two modes are consistent.\n2. Three models were tested: GSA, GDN, and RWKV7. The results show that GSA and GDN produced inconsistent outputs, whereas RWKV7 passed the test.\n3. In our training mission, all three models showed normal training loss and static validation results. However, the online testing performance of GSA and GDN fell far short of expectations, with results as poor as those of a random policy. By contrast, RWKV7 demonstrated normal online testing results.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce the Bug\n\n```\nimport torch\nimport fla\nfrom fla.models.gated_deltanet.modeling_gated_deltanet import GatedDeltaNetBlock\nfrom fla.models.gated_deltanet.configuration_gated_deltanet import GatedDeltaNetConfig\nfrom fla.models.gsa.modeling_gsa import GSABlock\nfrom fla.models.gsa.configuration_gsa import GSAConfig\nfrom fla.models.utils import Cache\n\nbsz = 1\nhidden_size = 2048\nseq_len = 1024\nseg_len = 128\nlr = 1.0e-3\nuse_cache = True\n\nseg_num = (seq_len - 1) // seg_len + 1\n\nmodel = \"GDN\"\nif model == \"GDN\":\n    config = GatedDeltaNetConfig(\n        attn_mode='chunk',\n        hidden_size=hidden_size,\n        num_heads=8,  \n        head_dim=int(0.75 * hidden_size // 8)\n    )\n    encoder = GatedDeltaNetBlock(\n        config,\n        layer_idx=0\n    ).to('cuda')\nelse:\n    config = GSAConfig(\n        attn_mode='chunk',\n        hidden_size=hidden_size,\n        num_heads=8\n    )\n    encoder = GSABlock(\n        config,\n        layer_idx=0\n    ).to('cuda')\n\ninputs = torch.randn(bsz, seq_len, hidden_size, device='cuda')\n\ny_full, _,  _ = encoder(\n    hidden_states=inputs,\n    past_key_values=None,\n    use_cache=False\n)\n\nb = 0\ncache = None\n\nfor seg_id in range(seg_num):\n    b = seg_id * seg_len\n    e = min(b + seg_len, seq_len)\n\n    segment_input = inputs[:, b:e]\n\n    y_segment, _, cache = encoder(\n        hidden_states=segment_input,\n        past_key_values=cache,\n        use_cache=use_cache,\n    )\n\n    err = torch.sum((y_full[:, b:e] - y_segment)**2)\n    print(f\"Segment {seg_id}: Error = {err.item()}\")\n```\n\nGot the following Output:\nGDN：\nSegment 0: Error = 0.0023405884858220816\nSegment 1: Error = 1012.900634765625\nSegment 2: Error = 1055.44775390625\nSegment 3: Error = 1116.5162353515625\nSegment 4: Error = 1089.9141845703125\nSegment 5: Error = 1107.427734375\nSegment 6: Error = 1104.24560546875\nSegment 7: Error = 1107.385986328125\n\nGSA:\nSegment 0: Error = 1.5609190313625732e-06\nSegment 1: Error = 3535.44677734375\nSegment 2: Error = 3311.689208984375\nSegment 3: Error = 3273.07568359375\nSegment 4: Error = 3326.33642578125\nSegment 5: Error = 3503.629638671875\nSegment 6: Error = 3420.8076171875\nSegment 7: Error = 3332.25048828125\n\nRWKV7:\nSegment 0: Error = 0.0\nSegment 1: Error = 0.0\nSegment 2: Error = 0.0\nSegment 3: Error = 0.0\nSegment 4: Error = 0.0\nSegment 5: Error = 0.0\nSegment 6: Error = 0.0\nSegment 7: Error = 0.0\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nError close to 0.\n\n### Environment Information\n\n1.

Previously, the layout had inconsistent button sizes, lack of proper spacing, and weak visual hierarchy, making the interface less intuitive. These enhancements improve readability, accessibility, and overall user experience.\n\n**Changes Implemented**\n\nHeader Layout: Added a \"Group Name\" label, increased group name size, and aligned the primary mentor section for better structure.\n\nSection Styling: Introduced light gray backgrounds, subtle shadows, and better spacing to visually separate sections.\n\nButton Consistency: Standardized button sizes, improved alignment, and added hover effects.\n\nVisual Hierarchy: Improved typography, spacing, padding, and margins for a more professional look.\n\n**Screenshots**\n\nBefore:\n\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f082aa89-32c7-4bec-8907-a7fde0b66aa3\" />\n\nAfter:\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d40387fe-9941-4f29-9bcb-4e331ede97b4\n\nAdditional Context\n\nThese refinements contribute to a more structured and user-friendly experience, making navigation and interaction more seamless.\n\nAre you working on this issue?\n\n✅ Yes, I have implemented the changes and am submitting them for review.\n",

This regression might have been introduced in PR [#424](https://github.com/your-repo/your-project/pull/424). A possible (but unconfirmed) cause could be related to the handling of emoji suggestions for the last word — further debugging is required to verify this.\n\n#### Workaround\nExecuting the **plural** command with unknown words seems to restore the Enter key's normal behavior. This behavior is demonstrated in the attached video.\n\n#### Expected Behavior\nPressing the **Enter** key should insert a newline and move the cursor to the next line, maintaining standard input behavior.\n\n#### Attachments\n- Video demonstrating the bug and workaround\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/801cbea9-7138-4833-a1f0-dc6ca471b56b\n\n\n### Device type\n\nSamsung SM-921W\n\n### Versions\n\nandroid 15, Current version of main",

      "description" : "### Apache Airflow Provider(s)\n\nhttp\n\n### Versions of Apache Airflow Providers\n\n5.3.0\n\n### Apache Airflow version\n\n3.0.2\n\n### Operating System\n\nUbuntu 24.04.2 LTS\n\n### Deployment\n\nVirtualenv installation\n\n### Deployment details\n\n- **Deployment Type**: Virtualenv installation\n- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS\n- **Python Version**: 3.12.3\n- **Airflow Version**: 3.0.2\n- **HTTP Provider Version**: 5.3.0\n- **Database Backend**: PostgreSQL 16\n- **Secrets Backend**: Microsoft Azure Key Vault\n- **Authentication**: Flask AppBuilder (FAB) with Microsoft Entra ID (SSO)\n- **SSL Configuration**: Enabled with custom certificates\n- **Timezone**: Pacific/Auckland\n- **Airflow Services Management**: systemd unit files for `api-server`, `scheduler`, `dag-processor`, and `triggerer`\n- **Custom Configuration Highlights**:\n  - Airflow configuration (`airflow.cfg`) includes:\n    - `sql_alchemy_conn_secret` for DB connection string\n    - Azure Key Vault integration for secrets\n    - SSL cert/key paths\n    - FAB auth manager\n  - Environment variables for Azure credentials (`AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`)\n  - Custom `webserver_config.py` for SSO\n  - Firewall configured to allow port 8443\n\n### What happened\n\nI encountered an issue while using a deferrable `HttpSensor` in Airflow 3.0.2. The sensor is configured to use a connection (`https_host-has-no-schema`) with the following details:\n\n- **Host**: `dummyjson.com`\n- **Port**: `443`\n- **Schema**: `https`\n\nDuring the initial execution, the sensor correctly uses `HttpHook` to send a GET request to `https://dummyjson.com:443/fake_endpoint`, receives a 404 response, and defers the task as expected.\n\nHowever, when the deferred task resumes via `HttpSensorTrigger`, the trigger internally creates an `HttpAsyncHook` object. This hook retrieves the connection using `self.get_connection(self.http_conn_id)` but appears to lose the `schema` value. As a result, the final request URL becomes `http://dummyjson.com:443/fake_endpoint`, which is incorrect and causes unexpected behavior.\n\nThis discrepancy between `HttpHook` and `HttpAsyncHook` in handling the connection schema seems to stem from how the connection object is retrieved and interpreted asynchronously. The issue may involve `BaseHook.get_connection`, `Connection`, or `TaskSDKConnection` not properly preserving or propagating the `schema` field.\n\nHere’s a log fragment showing the incorrect behavior. The first request `https` but the second request is `http`.\n```log\n[2025-06-27, 01:46:26] INFO - Connection Retrieved 'https_host-has-no-schema': source=\"airflow.hooks.base\"\n[2025-06-27, 01:46:26] DEBUG - Connection Details: 'Connection(conn_id='https_host-has-no-schema', conn_type='http', description=None, host='dummyjson.com', schema='https', login=None, password=None, port=443, extra=None)': source=\"airflow.hooks.base\"\n[2025-06-27, 01:46:26] DEBUG - Sending 'GET' to url: https://dummyjson.com:443/fake_endpoint: source=\"airflow.task.hooks.airflow.providers.http.hooks.http.HttpHook\"\n......\n[2025-06-27, 01:46:31] INFO - Connection Retrieved 'https_host-has-no-schema': source=\"airflow.hooks.base\"\n[2025-06-27, 01:46:31] DEBUG - Connection Details: 'Connection(conn_id='https_host-has-no-schema', conn_type='http', description=None, host='dummyjson.com', schema=None, login=None, password=None, port=443, extra=None)': source=\"airflow.hooks.base\"\n[2025-06-27, 01:46:31] WARNING - [Try 1 of 3] Request to http://dummyjson.com:443/fake_endpoint failed.: source=\"airflow.providers.http.hooks.http.HttpAsyncHook\"\n```\n\n### What you think should happen instead\n\nThe expected behavior is that both HttpHook and HttpAsyncHook should consistently respect the schema field defined in the Airflow connection. In this case, the connection https_host-has-no-schema explicitly sets schema=https, so all HTTP requests — synchronous or asynchronous — should use https:// in the final URL.\n\n### How to reproduce\n\n1. **Create an Airflow connection** named `https_host-has-no-schema` with the following settings:\n   - **Host**: `dummyjson.com`\n   - **Port**: `443`\n   - **Schema**: `https`\n   - Leave login, password, and extra fields empty.\n\n2. **Create a DAG** with the following code:\n\n   ```python\n   from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n   from airflow import DAG\n   from airflow.providers.http.sensors.http import HttpSensor\n   from airflow.providers.http.operators.http import HttpOperator\n\n   with DAG(\n       dag_id=\"dag_reproduce_issue\",\n       description=\"Reproduce\",\n       start_date=datetime.now() - timedelta(days=1),\n       schedule=None,\n       catchup=False,\n       default_args={\n           \"retries\": 0,\n           \"retry_delay\": timedelta(minutes=1),\n       },\n       tags=[\"reproduce_issue\"],\n   ) as dag:\n\n       https_operator = HttpOperator(\n           task_id=\"https_operator\",\n           http_conn_id=\"https_host-has-no-schema\",\n           endpoint=\"products\",\n           method=\"GET\",\n       )\n\n       https_sensor = HttpSensor(\n           task_id=\"https_sensor\",\n           http_conn_id=\"https_host-has-no-schema\",\n           endpoint=\"fake_endpoint\",\n           method=\"GET\",\n           deferrable=True,\n           poke_interval=30,\n           timeout=60,\n       )\n\n       https_operator >> https_sensor\n   ```\n\n3. **Run the DAG**. Observe the following:\n   - `https_operator` sends a request to `https://dummyjson.com:443/products` and succeeds.\n   - `https_sensor` initially sends a request to `https://dummyjson.com:443/fake_endpoint`, receives a 404, and defers.\n   - When resumed by `HttpSensorTrigger`, the request is sent to `http://dummyjson.com:443/fake_endpoint` instead of `https`.\n\n4. **Check the logs** of the triggerer process to confirm the incorrect URL schema.\n\n### Anything else\n\nThis issue occurs **every time** under the following conditions:\n\n- The Airflow connection's **host** field does **not include a URL schema** (i.e., no `http://` or `https://`).\n- The **schema** field in the connection is explicitly set to `https`.\n- The `HttpSensor` is set to `deferrable=True`. I did not test when `deferrable=False`.\n\nUnder these conditions, the `HttpAsyncHook` used by `HttpSensorTrigger` fails to apply the `https` schema and defaults to `http`, resulting in incorrect request URLs.\n\nHowever, if the host is set to `https://dummyjson.com` (i.e., includes the schema directly in the host field), the issue does **not** occur. In that case, both the host and port are correctly loaded and used by `HttpAsyncHook`.\n\nTo better observe this behavior, it is recommended to enable **DEBUG logging level** in Airflow. This will show the full request URL constructed by the hook and confirm whether the schema is being applied correctly.\n\n### Are you willing to submit PR?\n\n- [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n",

This way BigQuery can be used as a source of truth for these values.\r\n\r\nOther database drivers could then follow a similar model, for example Postgres has comment fields which can be expected to have the same structured JSON message if the driver is switched to propagate Data Model annotations from the source system table metadata.\r\n\r\nIs this a good proposal?

Policies are defined in YAML and \nsent over gRPC to the local KubeArmor agent.\n\nSubcommands:                                                                                 <- content of long description\n  • add     Apply a new policy from a YAML file (kubearmor vm policy add <file>)\n  • delete  Remove an existing policy by its YAML file (kubearmor vm policy delete <file>)\n\nGlobal Flags:                                                                                 <- content of long description\n  • --gRPC <address>   Address of the KubeArmor gRPC server (host:port)\n\nExamples:\n  # Apply a file‑access policy on a standalone host:\n  karmor vm policy add ./file-access.yaml --gRPC 127.0.0.1:50051\n\n  # Remove that policy when finished:\n  karmor vm policy delete ./file-access.yaml --gRPC 127.0.0.1:50051\n\nSee each subcommand's help for more details:\n  karmor vm policy add --help\n  karmor vm policy delete --help\n\nUsage:\n  karmor vm policy [command]\n\nAvailable Commands:                                                                            <- generated by Cobra\n  add         add policy for non kubernetes/bare metal KubeArmor\n  delete      delete policy for non kubernetes/bare metal KubeArmor\n  get         get policy for bare-metal vm/kvms control plane vm\n\nFlags:                                                                                         <- generated by Cobra\n      --gRPC string   gRPC server information\n  -h, --help          help for policy\n\nGlobal Flags:                                                                                  <- generated by Cobra\n      --context string      Name of the kubeconfig context to use\n      --kubeconfig string   Path to the kubeconfig file to use\n\nUse \"karmor vm policy [command] --help\" for more information about a command.\n```\nManually added Long description currently contains:\n\n- Description of command\n- Subcommands: add, delete, etc.\n- Global Flags: --gRPC, etc.\n- Example Usage\n\nThese are also automatically rendered by Cobra, making their inclusion in Long unnecessary. We only need Description and Example Usage\n\n## Proposed Change:\nRefactor the Long descriptions for CLI commands to contain only:\n\n- Command overview\n- Example for usage\n\nRemove manually added subcommands and global flags from the long description.\n\nThis will ensure the CLI help remains clean, DRY, and easier to maintain.\n\nThanks!",

      "comments" : [ "<!-- Answer -->\nThis issue is likely related to how Superset handles time ranges and time grain in the backend query. The X axis only shows periods present in the query result, so if the last month is missing from your chart, it's probably not included in the query output. This can happen if the time range end boundary is exclusive or if the SQL time grain logic doesn't generate a row for the last month.\n\nThere have been recent fixes that may help: one ensures all x-axis date labels for the selected time grain are displayed ([PR 33191](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/33191)), and another adds an option to show all X axis ticks on timeseries charts ([PR 33729](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/33729)). Make sure your deployment includes these changes and try enabling the new X axis tick display option if it's available.\n\nIf the issue persists, check the SQL generated for your chart to confirm the last month is included in the result set. Adjusting the time range or time grain settings may help.

The backend time grain logic (including \"month\") is handled in `superset/db_engine_specs/base.py` [[source]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/2e9939baf253e607a54722b1996baaf625e72133/superset/db_engine_specs/base.py).\n\nTo fix this, check the SQL generated for your chart and make sure the last month is included in the result set. If your time range is exclusive at the end, try making it inclusive. If you want the last month to appear even when there is no data, you’ll need to pad missing periods in the backend query (e.g., generate a series of all expected months and left join your data onto it). There isn’t a built-in frontend option to do this automatically.\n\nIf you want to explore a frontend solution, you’d need to modify the logic in `extractSeries` to inject missing periods, but this is usually best handled on the backend for consistency across all visualizations.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

Do you know how I can approach that?\r\n\r\nAlso correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems the intention of the ticket is the following: \r\n1) Application (Managing Appprojects) - Gets a Delete request from CLI,UI, etc.\r\n2) Application - Gets a finalizer/enters deleting state, and then starts processing it's live objects \r\n3) AppProject Deletion - Gets a finalizer/enters deleting state \r\n4) Check for Apps - Check to see if any apps reference the AppProject\r\n- If yes, skip removing finalizer + skip deletion\r\n- If no, remove finalizer + delete project\r\n\r\nFYI, I'm sure I'm slightly incorrect on some of the above details, but let me know. Thanks!!!", "Nvm, I managed to figure out/resolve the issue.

Basically, a project being removed from Pruning. Writing the e2e will allow you to test the scenarios and will also be useful to validate the implementation.\n\nI think this code will not be reached since the resource wont have a finalizer added to it. This enhancement is to always add a finalizer when the AppProject is deleted (or maybe add it when it is created?) to perform the validation since Argo CD is the controller responsible for the AppProject." ],

And if you want you can join us to set https://github.com/code-charity/youtube/labels, closing issues, etc. \r\n- <b> `managing (old & new) code:`</b> [example](https://github.com/code-charity/youtube/pull/2157)", "hi! @xiomaraR,  thanks and glad if it wasn't too much to read. Let's make this list of types of tasks a [wiki page](https://github.com/code-charity/youtube/wiki) here?\r\nWe don't have a mirror button yet. (closed #80. Once added, we can checkbox it above.)  \r\n - You could start with a [copy of the rotate button](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Acode-charity%2Fyoutube+rotate_button&type=code), adjusting the names & CSS-injection. \r\n   - The function in player.js is the main thing; in our menu Mirror can be listed below Rotate (and you don't have to add it to all the language files, but only to /en/messages.json;  while the first search result (\"core.js\") is only for this: \"// REACTION OR VISUAL FEEDBACK WHEN THE USER CHANGES A SETTING (already automated for our CSS features)\" ) as written above it</i>)\r\n   - So while wanted & minimal, it is ultimately a task AI should do. And for you personally it might only serve to get familiar with webExtensions & this repo (i saw you have a github history\uD83D\uDC4D).  And mirror isn't immediately a unique feature (existing solution with 30 000 users, forgot to link it at first).  So, while i initially though of suggesting Mirror as a beginner-friendly example, it ended up as an example for this type of task instead ( `Assessing / Re-evaluating plans`) <br> and i added this sub-task: (<a href=\"https://github.com/code-charity/youtube/issues/1445#:~:text=remember%20per%20video%20or%20per%20loop%2C%20if%20a%20loop%20is%20set.%20Compare%3A%20mirrortube\"> above </a>)\r\n      - > - [ ] remember per video or per selection, if a loop is or will be set too for this video.

And `moving Subtitles/Captions` below the player will be unique too. (remembered these through checking the labels: #unique, #set&forget, #plan-ready)\r\n         - and we can search more specifically:  [is:open `milestone:\"Little or easy(?)\"` `label:\"\uD83E\uDDE9Plan ready\"` -`label:\"Rare use-case?\"`](https://github.com/code-charity/youtube/issues?q=is%3Aopen+milestone%3A%22Little+or+easy%28%3F%29%22+label%3A%22%F0%9F%A7%A9Plan+ready%22+-label%3A%22Rare+use-case%3F%22+)  \r\n           - so (surprise!) we find the frequent wish of [a shortcut for the rotate button](https://github.com/code-charity/youtube/issues/1699#issuecomment-1751485020)!, part of which you can copy paste in our [shortcuts.js](https://github.com/code-charity/youtube/blob/master/js%26css/web-accessible/www.youtube.com/shortcuts.js?rgh-link-date=2023-10-06T23%3A02%3A12Z).     \r\n         - More over the following player button will be a novelty, since YouTube didn't always provide the headmap:\r\n              - > - [ ] Skip to next key scene data-source: https://github.com/code-charity/youtube/issues/1463 \r\n           -  So this 3rd example, seemed best to suggest,  since this one could (optionally) directly inspire various `Development / engineering`-thoughts.

It will probably be cheap too since it is an open source model. Here the link - please add a rocket: \nhttps://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingface/InferenceSupport/discussions/2927\n\n",

      "comments" : [ "I want to take this as my first issue.\r\n\r\nWhen you say \"On startup the ChannelManager will broadcast the latest state transaction(s) for any ChannelMonitor it has for which it has no Channel\" I assume you mean [channelmanager.rs:6823-6828](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/blob/79e2af949700281b7333f202a7292e3bf81dc674/lightning/src/ln/channelmanager.rs#L6823-L6828) where it checks for each channel monitor if it's funding transaction is not in the funding transactions set, right? Then if I understand this correctly, when de-serializing the persisted state, every `ChannelMonitorUpdateStep` for a `ChannelMonitor` is replayed so that we build up to the state we had before the last shutdown. Then, the solution you propose would be to\r\n- Add a new property `allow_automated_broadcast` to `ChannelMonitorImpl` that defaults to `true`\r\n- On `update_monitor`, when matching `ChannelForceClosed` with `should_broadcast: false` set the flag to `false`\r\n- On `broadcast_latest_holder_commitment_txn` check for the flag and if it's `false` then... `log_info!` and do nothing?\r\n\r\nSome questions I have:\r\n- It feels odd to have a method called `braodcast...` that won't _always_ broadcast. Should we either:\r\n  - Rename the method to `maybe_broadcast_latest_holder_commitment_txn`, so that it's explicit that under certain conditions it will not broadcast?\r\n  - Define a new method `maybe_broadcast...` that wraps up the current one but checks the flag first and use this new method in this specific use case?\r\n  \r\n  I'm also asking because the method is also called  when the de-serialized `ChannelManager` is stale compared to the `ChannelMonitor`, though in this case there is a channel in the  founding transactions set ([lines 6789-6804](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/blob/79e2af949700281b7333f202a7292e3bf81dc674/lightning/src/ln/channelmanager.rs#L6789-L6805)). I assume in that case too we want the flag to stop us, but I want to make sure I'm not changing some important semantics.\r\n- Is there any other `ChannelMonitorUpdateStep` that would imply that it's safe again to broadcast? Looking at the docs for the Enum I would guess no, but asking just in case.", "Heh, 1564 didn't resolve this, it just referenced it...", "Yes, your understanding is correct, as for your questions:\r\n\r\n> It feels odd to have a method called braodcast... that won't always broadcast. Should we either:\r\n\r\nProbably the second, its still important that users be able to broadcast the latest state if they want to, so we at least need an option to broadcast the state, though it also wouldn't be unreasonable to split it into two methods - `maybe_` and `force_..._unsafe` to indicate that the first will only work if we think its okay to do so, and the second will force it to happen even if its unsafe to do so.\r\n\r\n> I'm also asking because the method is also called when the de-serialized ChannelManager is stale compared to the ChannelMonitor, though in this case there is a channel in the founding transactions set ([lines 6789-6804](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/blob/79e2af949700281b7333f202a7292e3bf81dc674/lightning/src/ln/channelmanager.rs#L6789-L6805)). I assume in that case too we want the flag to stop us, but I want to make sure I'm not changing some important semantics.\r\n\r\nI think in that case, yes, the flag should stop us (though of course generally the flag is not set).\r\n\r\n> Is there any other ChannelMonitorUpdateStep that would imply that it's safe again to broadcast? Looking at the docs for the Enum I would guess no, but asking just in case.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo, once its unsafe its unsafe. Unsafe here means we've lost some data, there's no way to recover that data.", "Great. I'll get to work into the PR then. Thanks!", "I'm having a hard time trying to test the code. I'll keep working on it but I'm posting my progress here in case anyone wants to throw help/comments/ideas. My idea would be to cover this new behavior with a simple unit test that:\r\n- Builds a `ChannelMonitor`\r\n- Sends it a `ForceClosed{should_broadcast: false}`\r\n- Writes and reads it again\r\n- And then tries to call the new methods and asserts whether the transaction was broadcasted.\r\n\r\nMy plan was to copy and adapt some other other unit test for `broadcast_latest_holder_commitment_txn` but couldn't find any. If I understand correctly, you write unit tests for this at the end of the module and integration tests in separate modules, mostly in `funcional_tests.rs`. I also found:\r\n- A `TestPersister` that I think implement Write And Read in-memory.\r\n- A `TestBroadcaster` that can probably help me with the assertions\r\n- A `check_closed_broadcast!` which I believe won't be useful here cause it's checking whether we broadcasted the channel closed message as a gossip update for network peers. Though I'm not really sure I understood correctly.\r\n- On your last PR Matt, you added `do_test_data_loss_protect` which seems to be a more general case integration test. Maybe I should just (or also) extend that one?", "I left a small pointer on your PR and let's continue there but in general its probably simplest and most-coverage to add a new functional test based on an existing one.", "2025-01-30T10:33:55.371Z hydra_bitcoin::node::logger:22: A ChannelManager is stale compared to the current ChannelMonitor!\nimports.wbg.__wbg_error_80de38b3f7cc3c3c @ hydra_node.js:9025\nhydra_node.js:9025 ERROR 2025-01-30T10:33:55.372Z hydra_bitcoin::node::logger:22:  The channel will be force-closed and the latest commitment transaction from the ChannelMonitor broadcast.\nimports.wbg.__wbg_error_80de38b3f7cc3c3c @ hydra_node.js:9025\nhydra_node.js:9025 ERROR 2025-01-30T10:33:55.372Z hydra_bitcoin::node::logger:22:  The ChannelMonitor for channel b37b4660dec0340c000ab33a9c877d671a7e4fe3f7f9945cd9704668e760430f is at update_id 27 but the ChannelManager is at update_id 26.\nimports.wbg.__wbg_error_80de38b3f7cc3c3c @ hydra_node.js:9025\nhydra_node.js:9025 ERROR 2025-01-30T10:33:55.372Z hydra_bitcoin::node::logger:22:  The ChannelMonitor for channel b37b4660dec0340c000ab33a9c877d671a7e4fe3f7f9945cd9704668e760430f is at holder commitment number 281474976710644 but the ChannelManager is at holder commitment number 281474976710645.\nimports.wbg.__wbg_error_80de38b3f7cc3c3c @ hydra_node.js:9025\nhydra_node.js:9025 ERROR 2025-01-30T10:33:55.372Z hydra_bitcoin::node::logger:22: A ChannelManager is stale compared to the current ChannelMonitor!\nimports.wbg.__wbg_error_80de38b3f7cc3c3c @ hydra_node.js:9025\nhydra_node.js:9025 ERROR 2025-01-30T10:33:55.372Z hydra_bitcoin::node::logger:22:  The channel will be force-closed and the latest commitment transaction from the ChannelMonitor broadcast.\nimports.wbg.__wbg_error_80de38b3f7cc3c3c @ hydra_node.js:9025\nhydra_node.js:9025 ERROR 2025-01-30T10:33:55.372Z hydra_bitcoin::node::logger:22:  The ChannelMonitor for channel d91933328927a0fcd20613150cbb852bf8d9d5873b716ab44ce50d504975b8a4 is at update_id 15 but the ChannelManager is at update_id 13.\nimports.wbg.__wbg_error_80de38b3f7cc3c3c @ hydra_node.js:9025\nhydra_node.js:9025 ERROR 2025-01-30T10:33:55.372Z hydra_bitcoin::node::logger:22:  The ChannelMonitor for channel d91933328927a0fcd20613150cbb852bf8d9d5873b716ab44ce50d504975b8a4 is at holder commitment number 281474976710649 but the ChannelManager is at holder commitment number 281474976710650.\nimports.wbg.__wbg_error_80de38b3f7cc3c3c @ hydra_node.js:9025\nhydra_node.js:9025 ERROR 2025-01-30T10:33:55.372Z hydra_bitcoin::node::logger:22:  The ChannelMonitor for channel d91933328927a0fcd20613150cbb852bf8d9d5873b716ab44ce50d504975b8a4 is at revoked counterparty transaction number 281474976710650 but the ChannelManager is at revoked counterparty transaction number 281474976710651.\nimports.wbg.__wbg_error_80de38b3f7cc3c3c @ hydra_node.js:9025\n\nis this related?", "@philipp1992 not quite.

My DAG configs were: retries=1000, retry_delay=5 min (300 seconds), max_retry_delay=1h (3600 seconds). My DAG failed ~1000 times and after that Scheduler broke down. After that retries exceeded 1000 and stopped on 1017 retry attempt. \n\nI did my research on this problem and found that this happened due to formula **min_backoff = math.ceil(delay.total_seconds() * (2 ** (self.try_number - 1)))** in **taskinstance.py** file. So retry_exponential_backoff has no limit of try_number and during calculations it can overflow max Float value. So even if max_retry_delay is set formula is still calculating.

      "description" : "# GPU Support for the Ersilia Model Hub\n\n## Background\n\nCurrently, the Ersilia Model Hub does not support GPU acceleration, which limits the performance of some models — and makes others completely unusable. Models are currently packaged as CPU-only Docker images. The goal of this project is to evaluate and implement GPU support using Docker.\n\n## Goals\n\n- Demonstrate that a model can run inside a Docker container with GPU access.\n- Build the foundation to support GPU in the Ersilia infrastructure (template, CLI, metadata, CI/CD).\n- Benchmark performance between CPU and GPU runs.\n\n## Step 1: Manual GPU Docker Test (Top-Down)\n\nWe will first verify that models can run in a GPU-enabled Docker container, without relying on Ersilia's internal infrastructure (e.g., CLI or model template).\n\n- [ ] Select two test models:\n  - [ ] One **GPU-only** model (TBD).\n  - [ ] One **GPU/CPU-compatible** model (suggested: FAISS-based).\n- [ ] Set up the new GPU workstation.\n- [ ] Choose and test an appropriate CUDA base image (e.g., `nvidia/cuda:...`).\n- [ ] Ensure image size is acceptable (<~4GB ideally).\n- [ ] Run tests on:\n  - [ ] At least two local GPU workstations.\n  - [ ] One cloud instance (e.g., AWS GPU instance).\n\n## Step 2: Integrate GPU Support into Ersilia Infrastructure\n\n### \uD83E\uDDF1 At the [Ersilia Template](https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos-template) level\n\n- [ ] How should `install.yml` indicate GPU requirements?\n- [ ] If model code differs between CPU/GPU, how should this be reflected in the `framework/`?\n\n### ⚙️ At the [Ersilia CLI](https://github.com/ersilia-os/ersilia) level\n\n- [ ] Add support for `--gpu` or `--cpu` flags in the `ersilia serve` command.\n- [ ] Decide whether GPU/CPU mode should be:\n  - Explicit (user-defined via flag), or\n  - Automatic (detect from hardware?)\n- [ ] Assess: Can one image support both CPU and GPU, or do we need separate ones?\n\n### \uD83D\uDCE6 At the [Ersilia Metadata](https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos5axz/blob/main/metadata.json) level\n\n- [ ] Add `runtime: GPU` / `CPU` or similar field.\n- [ ] Consider `requirements` or `compatibility` sections if needed.\n\n### \uD83D\uDC33 On [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/ersiliaos)\n\n- [ ] Should GPU-compatible images use a separate tag (e.g., `model:gpu`) or separate repo?\n- [ ] Define tagging convention early.\n\n## Step 3: GitHub Actions & CI Integration\n\nIn the [Ersilia Model Workflows](https://github.com/ersilia-os/ersilia-model-workflows):\n\n- [ ] Detect whether a model supports GPU.\n- [ ] Build and push a GPU-compatible Docker image (using `nvidia-docker`).\n- [ ] Ensure existing workflows are not broken.\n\nIn the [Ersilia CLI CI/CD](https://github.com/ersilia-os/ersilia):\n\n- [ ] Add at least one unit test to check GPU execution (on GitHub-hosted runners or self-hosted runner with GPU).\n\n## Step 4: Benchmarking & Validation\n\n- [ ] Run performance benchmarks:\n  - CPU vs GPU execution time.\n  - Memory consumption and constraints.\n- [ ] Record any limitations or environment-specific requirements.",

For example : \n\n```nvidia/cuda:12.9.0-runtime-ubuntu24.04```\n\nThis comes to ~ 2 GB/3 GB depending on the exact CUDA and Ubuntu Version being used. \n\nIdeally run automated tests/builds for different combinations of Ubuntu (or other distributions?) and CUDA  versions. \n\n## CPU vs GPU preliminary testing\n\nA very simple test on TabPFN using a [Sci-Kit Learn Breast Cancer Dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html) showed approximately 3x-4x speed ups when GPU access to the process was enabled, compared to CPU only runs (on the Norrsken GPU Workstation).\n\nMore detailed tests using a [Dataset of approximately 2 Million Compounds](https://github.com/ersilia-os/sars-cov-2-chemspace/blob/main/data/reference_library_inchikeys.csv) showed overwhelming speed-ups with GPU Accelerated similarity searches using [FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss), the difference between search times of GPU and CPU implementations scaled/diverged with the Index size. **It is clearly worth trying to accelerate models using GPU Acceleration.**\n\nWe built indices out of Count Fingerprints of the compounds (converted the SMILES to 2048 Vectors). Cosine Similarity was used as a metric. \n\nFAISS does not support cosine by default, so we use  an `Inner Product` index and perform L2 (Euclidean) Normalisation on the vectors before adding to them to the index (or before searching), which is the equivalent of using Cosine similarity.\n\nTests were ran with index sizes of `10,000`, `100,000`, `500,000` and `1,000,000`. Nearest 100 Neighbours. \n\n### Index size 100,000:\n| Number of Searches | CPU (s) | GPU (s) |\n|--------------------|---------|---------|\n| 100                | 1       | 0.01    |\n| 1,000              | 7.08    | 0.04    |\n| 10,000             | 67.49   | 0.11    |\n| 100,000            | >350    | 1.30    |\n| 500,000            | -       | 5.50    |\n\n### Index size 1,000,000\n\n| Number of Searches | CPU (s) | GPU (s) |\n|--------------------|---------|---------|\n| 100                | 9.42    | 0.02    |\n| 1,000              | 71      | 0.10    |\n| 10,000             | 711     | 1.03    |\n| 100,000            | -       | 10.45   |\n| 500,000            | -       | 52.50   |\n\n\n\n### \n\n<img width=\"765\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e39adae0-7c06-43ba-ba5f-3da89037da02\" />\n\n_NOTE: GPUs are typically higher latency but have higher parallel throughput and memory bandwidth than CPUs. It is best to use batch queries with the CPU or GPU as this amortises the touching of index memory across all of the queries and this is when GPU speed ups are convenient. We will most likely not see any improvements in GPU search times with single queries (if anything it might be slower because of GPU overhead)._\n\n\nThe examples of inference time comparisons and a 3D plot (inference time against index and query sizes), clearly demonstrate **GPUs provide absolutely non-trivial speed ups for the right tasks.**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "# Very Heavy Index (FAISS Flat)\n\nFlat (IP and L2 for example) indices are extremely large (because FAISS only supports Float32 vectors, hence each Fingerprint vector is 32 * 2048 = 65,536 Bits or 4 * 2048=8,192  Bytes), scaling up to millions of vectors means we are dealing with indices that are 10s of GBs.\n\nTried FPSim2 but there are no benefits to GPU accelerating since it does not support batch queries (could be worth looking into CUDA Programming and tuning it to support batch queries, as it supports Sparse Vectors and Tanimoto Search on GPU)\n\n## Promising alternative to Flat FAISS Index: **Approximate Nearest Neighbour (ANN) search**\n\nMost methods for ANN require index training and parameter tuning which makes building the index more complex. We also need to ensure that the training sample is diverse. \n\nPlease note the difference between training and adding to Indices. And index cannot be trained incrementally but can be incrementally added to.\n\nMemory bottlenecks are also an issue so I first train the index and then add vectors to it incrementally in batches. (Although, it is suggested, If possible at all,  add more compute at index build time. (Especially if the index does not change a lot over time))\n\nThe following ANN methods are explored and suggested (compared to ~16 GB with a flat index of around 1.99 million Vectors)\n\n### **_IVFPQ (Inverted File Index with Product Quantisation):_** \n\n#### **_I am yet to do Accuracy tests on IVFPQ but with computational performance (inference time), models seem to enjoy GPU Acceleration speed ups similar to those mentioned above for FAISS Flat indices._**\n\nThis creates very light indices: `~93 MB for an index of around 1.99 Million Vectors`, but there might be a non-trivial loss of accuracy. \n\nNote: For some reason after the index is trained and incrementally built, FAISS takes a lot of time to write it to disk which makes it look like the process is frozen but isn't actually frozen - it goes into an \"uninterruptible sleep\" because of Disk IO, as indicated by the \"D\" state in htop. \n\n### **_HNSWSQ (Hierarchical Navigable Small World Index with Scalar Quantisation)_**\n\nTraining is reasonably fast (with GPU) but adding vectors is computationally intensive and needs to batched appropriately.\n\n#### **_I am yet to do Accuracy tests on HNSWSQ but with computational performance , HNSW seem to enjoy GPU Acceleration only with at Training time as indices are pretty compact and are VERY FAST with CPU and FAISS does not have a GPU search for this yet._**\n\nWhen choosing the strength of quantisation, there is a trade off between memory and accuracy:\n\nIndex of **1.99 million Vectors**:\n\n```\n4.63 GB (~2KB Per Vector + overhead) with a  8-Bit Quantiser while maintaining around 95-98% Accuracy^\n\n\n\n2.59 GB (~1.15KB Per Vector + overhead) with a 4-Bit Quantiser  while maintaining around 90-95% Accuracy^\n```\n\n\nAdding vectors to this kind of index is slow.\n\n_^accuracy according to official documentation and third party tests_\n", "# Metric Learning - Embedding Model\n\nAnother alternative to using vanilla flat indices with 2048 dimensional fingerprints we explore is the use of a metric learning model to create embeddings that are lower dimensions. We use these embeddings to create flat FAISS indices that are much lighter than the standard fingerprint indices (512, 256, 128, 100 dimensional embeddings vs 2048 dimensional fingerprints). We uses torch's GPU version and enjoy non-trivial speed-ups at training time, while creating embeddings and inference time (FAISS Search using a GPU index).\n\nNote: The searches are performed on a flat index, hence are exact searches, but the using of the embedding model means there is an approximation.", "We are aiming to create compound similarity search models with 4 compound libraries:\n\n- ChemDiv (100k)\n- A representative of Enamine  (~9 million)\n- DrugBank (~11k)\n- COCONUT (should be between 500k and 1 Million)\n\nWe also create a _Metric Learning Embedding Model_ out of a [reference library of 2 million compounds.](https://github.com/ersilia-os/sars-cov-2-chemspace/blob/main/data/reference_library_inchikeys.csv).\n\nFor each of the above libraries the aim is to have 3 variants of indices:\n\n- _A flat IP index with L2 Normalisation_\n    - This is going to be very large for libraries with 500k+ compounds)\n\n- _A compressed IVFPQ IP index  with L2 normalisation (FAISS compression)_\n   - This creates very light indices but as mentioned above there is a loss of search accuracy\n\n- _A flat index created with embeddings from the above mentioned model._\n   - This is lets us create indices that are lighter than vanilla flat indices and also lets us have control and confidence over the accuracy of the search (given that we are confident in the embedding model, which is arguably simpler to benchmark).\n \n", "Implemented a metric learning pipeline that creates learned embeddings from existing flat FAISS index. \n\n### Transforms 2048-dimensional fingerprints → _256/128/100-dimensional learned embeddings_ with cosine similarity\n\n### Triplet sampling: Uses existing 2M compound FAISS index for mining hard positives/negatives\n\nEvaluations: ROC-AUC, AP, distance distributions, t-SNE visualizations\n\nThe pipeline maintains L2 normalization throughout for FlatIP cosine similarity and includes model checkpointing + SMILES mapping for deployment.\n\nCreated with PyTorch + FAISS GPU.

      "description" : "## Description\n\nThis is a feature request to add SHA-512 hash algorithm support to Trivy's SBOM parsing capabilities. Currently, Trivy only supports SHA-1, SHA-256, and MD5 hash algorithms when processing SBOM files.\n\nSome tools, particularly NPM's SBOM generation (`npm sbom`), use SHA-512 hashes for package integrity verification. Adding SHA-512 support would enable Trivy to fully process these SBOMs and preserve important security metadata.\n\n### Current limitations:\n- **CycloneDX**: SHA-512 hashes are ignored and the hashes field becomes `null`\n- **SPDX**: SHA-512 checksums are completely omitted from the output\n\n\n## Current Behavior\n\n### CycloneDX\nIn `pkg/sbom/cyclonedx/unmarshal.go:251-268`, the `unmarshalHashes` function only supports:\n- SHA1\n- SHA256\n- MD5\n\nAny other algorithm (including SHA-512) logs a warning but still creates a digest with an empty algorithm prefix (e.g., `:hashvalue` instead of `sha512:hashvalue`), resulting in malformed digest strings.\n\n### SPDX\nIn `pkg/sbom/spdx/marshal.go:501-522`, the `spdxChecksums` function has the same limitation, returning `nil` for unsupported algorithms.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe limitation stems from `pkg/digest/digest.go` which only defines three algorithms:\n```go\nconst (\n    SHA1   Algorithm = \"sha1\"\n    SHA256 Algorithm = \"sha256\"\n    MD5    Algorithm = \"md5\"\n)\n```\n\n## Desired Behavior\n\nTrivy should support SHA-512 hash algorithm alongside the existing SHA-1, SHA-256, and MD5 support. This would enable Trivy to:\n- Preserve SHA-512 hashes when processing SBOMs from NPM and other tools\n- Generate SBOMs with SHA-512 hashes when appropriate\n- Maintain full compatibility with CycloneDX and SPDX specifications\n\n\n## Impact\n\n- Loss of package integrity verification data\n- Generated SBOMs may be invalid or incomplete\n- Affects tools that rely on SHA-512 for security validation\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n1. Add SHA512 constant to `pkg/digest/digest.go`:\n   ```go\n   const (\n       SHA1   Algorithm = \"sha1\"\n       SHA256 Algorithm = \"sha256\"\n       SHA512 Algorithm = \"sha512\"\n       MD5    Algorithm = \"md5\"\n   )\n   ```\n\n2. Add SHA-512 calculation support in the digest package\n\n3. Update `unmarshalHashes` in CycloneDX:\n   ```go\n   case cdx.HashAlgoSHA512:\n       alg = digest.SHA512\n   ```\n\n4. Update `spdxChecksums` in SPDX:\n   ```go\n   case digest.SHA512:\n       alg = spdx.SHA512\n   ```\n\n## References\n\n- NPM SBOM documentation: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npm-sbom\n- CycloneDX hash algorithm specification: https://cyclonedx.org/docs/1.6/json/#components_items_hashes\n- SPDX checksum specification: https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/package-information/#79-package-checksum-field\n\n## Test Data\n\n### CycloneDX Example\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"http://cyclonedx.org/schema/bom-1.5.schema.json\",\n  \"bomFormat\": \"CycloneDX\",\n  \"specVersion\": \"1.5\",\n  \"components\": [\n    {\n      \"bom-ref\": \"lodash@4.17.21\",\n      \"type\": \"library\",\n      \"name\": \"lodash\",\n      \"version\": \"4.17.21\",\n      \"hashes\": [\n        {\n          \"alg\": \"SHA-512\",\n          \"content\": \"bf690311ee7b95e713ba568322e3533f2dd1cb880b189e99d4edef13592b81764daec43e2c54c61d5c558dc5cfb35ecb85b65519e74026ff17675b6f8f916f4a\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### SPDX Example\n```json\n{\n  \"spdxVersion\": \"SPDX-2.3\",\n  \"packages\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"lodash\",\n      \"SPDXID\": \"SPDXRef-Package-lodash-4.17.21\",\n      \"checksums\": [\n        {\n          \"algorithm\": \"SHA512\",\n          \"checksumValue\": \"bf690311ee7b95e713ba568322e3533f2dd1cb880b189e99d4edef13592b81764daec43e2c54c61d5c558dc5cfb35ecb85b65519e74026ff17675b6f8f916f4a\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Discussed in https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy/discussions/9082\n",

If it is the OAuth API then we could indicate unavailability on the backend (SaaS) side with a proper [HTTP error code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status#server_error_responses). \n* If it comes from the open GRPC port, then @npepinpe indicated the ingress/load balancer could detect unavailability and reject a remote connection; it would then lead to an improved UX on our end.\n\nMy ask is that if we take this issue, then we root cause the actual reason for the issue, and work with the respective teams to consider \"simple solutions\".\n\nOur rationale (\"why evolve\") is clear: The interaction of auto-pausing + Desktop Modeler to C8 SaaS deployment leads to a _guaranteed_ bad impression during the trial experience.", "I've tried to reproduce this now with a paused `Camunda 8.7+gen5` cluster.

This means that we'll have an error raised and an information that the refresh failed. (It is not true, since we only failed to get the status of the job)\r\n- The task is retried, **which means we’re triggering another job on tableau**\r\n- The two triggered jobs create a resource conflict.\n\n### What you think should happen instead\n\nThere should be a retry strategy on poking (wait_for_status), where we at least try to fetch the started job 2 more times before failing the task execution. This is to avoid a resource conflict on Tableau's side, which will happen when we initiate a new refresh while the existing one didn't finish.\n\n### How to reproduce\n\nMock a 502 response from a server when executing poking for status.\r\nPlease find attached logs form 3 attempts of the same DAG run (failed when really the job on Tableau succeeded).\r\n[dag_id=daily_refresh_tableau_workbooks_run_id=scheduled__2023-07-06T03_30_00+00_00_task_id=refresh_workbook_main_transactions_dashboard_attempt=3.log](https://github.com/apache/airflow/files/12144604/dag_id.daily_refresh_tableau_workbooks_run_id.scheduled__2023-07-06T03_30_00%2B00_00_task_id.refresh_workbook_main_transactions_dashboard_attempt.3.log)\r\n[dag_id=daily_refresh_tableau_workbooks_run_id=scheduled__2023-07-06T03_30_00+00_00_task_id=refresh_workbook_main_transactions_dashboard_attempt=3 (2).log](https://github.com/apache/airflow/files/12144606/dag_id.daily_refresh_tableau_workbooks_run_id.scheduled__2023-07-06T03_30_00%2B00_00_task_id.refresh_workbook_main_transactions_dashboard_attempt.3.2.log)\r\n[dag_id=daily_refresh_tableau_workbooks_run_id=scheduled__2023-07-06T03_30_00+00_00_task_id=refresh_workbook_main_transactions_dashboard_attempt=3 (1).log](https://github.com/apache/airflow/files/12144607/dag_id.daily_refresh_tableau_workbooks_run_id.scheduled__2023-07-06T03_30_00%2B00_00_task_id.refresh_workbook_main_transactions_dashboard_attempt.3.1.log)\r\n\n\n### Operating System\n\ndebian booster (docker)\n\n### Versions of Apache Airflow Providers\n\npache-airflow-providers-tableau 2.1.8\n\n### Deployment\n\nOfficial Apache Airflow Helm Chart\n\n### Deployment details\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else\n\n_No response_\n\n### Are you willing to submit PR?\n\n- [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n",

IIUC FS-HLE should write the values set by the game to the FS system save data, and then later return it. I don't think there's more to it, since the actual value checks are probably handled by the game itself?\n\nFor future compatibility with FS-LLE, it would be interesting to know what exactly the FS system save data for this looks like. Does FS create one file per game in its system save data, or does it use an internal format instead? Perhaps @ZeroSkill1 knows more?", "@neobrain I noticed some weird implementations on the FS side for secure values a while back, but I got busy so I left it unexplored until just now.\n\n- 0x865/0x866 require special permissions to use (or if the caller doesn't have them, at least the save ID set in the exheader) and read/write secure values only from the FS system save.\n- 0x86B/0x86C also require special permissions (save ID in the exheader does not suffice here) and read/write secure values directly to/from the save data DISA header and not the FS system save (the DISA header containing secure values [or hell, even gamecards being able to use secure values] is something that was previously *completely* unknown to my knowledge).\n\n- 0x86E/0x86F read and write secure values:\n    - to/from the FS module system save data for media types SD & NAND\n    - to/from the DISA header for gamecards\n- 0x870/0x871 are identical to 0x86E/0x86F, except that instead of taking a media type and title ID, those are resolved through internal state using the given archive handle (which of course only works if the handle corresponds to a DISA).\n\nI've added the storage format for values in the DISA header to 3dbrew already.\nAs for the structure of the FS system save for secure values, this is the structure (which I will also add to 3dbrew soon):\n\n```c\ntypedef union secval_key {\n    u64 title_id;\n    struct {\n        u32 slot;\n        u32 unique_id;\n    } key_with_slot;\n} secval_key;\n\ntypedef struct secure_save {\n    u8 version;\n    u8 pads[3];\n    u32 count;\n    u32 unused[1022];\n    secval_key keys[0x3800];\n    u64 secure_values[0x3800];\n} secure_save;\n```\n\nSystem savedata ID 0x10011 is used (one of two FS module system saves, the other being SEEDDB), in which a file named just `DB` is created, consisting entirely of just the `secure_save` struct.\n" ],

Improper nesting can confuse assistive technology users and impair content discoverability.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. go to a tutorial page (e.g., /tutorials/get-started/).\n2. Locate each heading\n3. Inspect the sequence of heading levels and observe instances where the heading level jumps by more than one (e.g., `<h1>` directly to `<h6>`), indicating improper nesting.\n\nfor example:\n\n#### page 1\n1. Go to /tutorials/setting-up-your-environment/\n2. Locate to the following elements\nPosition 1: h6 element “By Layla Quiñones, Jaleesa Trapp“\n\n#### page 2\n1. Go to /tutorials/get-started/.\n2.  Locate to the following element:\n* Position 1: h4 element \"Default Code\" in Step 1 section\n \n#### page 3\n1. Go to /tutorials/variables-and-change/.\n2.  Locate to the following element:\n* Position 1: h5 element \"Variables\" in Step 1 section\n* Position 2: h5 element \"String Interpolation\" in Step 1 section\n* Position 3: h5 element \"Custom Variables\" in Step 3 section\n* Position 4: h5 element \"Variable Scope\" in Step 3 section\n* Position 5: h5 element \"Using Variables for Animation\" in Step 3 section\n* Position 6: h5 element \"Animation and draw()\" in Step 4 section\n* Position 70: h5 element \"frameRate(), frameCount and console.log()\" in Step 4 section\n* Position 81: h5 element \"Error Messages\" in Step 7 section\n\n#### page 4\n1. Go to /tutorials/organizing-code-with-functions/.\n2.  Locate to the following element:\n* Position 1: h6 element \"By Greg Benedis-Grab, Layla Quiñones\"\n* Position 2: h5 element \"Or Try This Spicy Challenge!\" in Conclusion section\n* Position 3: h1 element \"Next Steps\"\n* Position 4: h1 element \"References\"\n\n#### page 5\n1. Go to /data-structure-garden/.\n2.  Locate to the following element:\n* Position 1: h6 element \"By Portia Morrell, Jaleesa Trapp, Kate Maschmeyer\"\n\n#### page 6\n1. Go to /tutorials/animating-with-media-objects/.\n2.  Locate to the following element:\n* Position 1: h6 element \"By Joanne Amarisa, Jaleesa Trapp, Greg Benedis-Grab\"\n* Position 2: h4 element \"Image files\" in step 1 section\n* Position 3: h3 element \"Conclusion\"\n* Position 4: h3 element \"Resources & References\"\n\n#### Page 7\nGo to route (p5js.org)\n2. Try to find h1 element in the page\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThose headings are not nested according to the heading-level hierarchy. For details, see the ‘Steps to Reproduce’ section above.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nAll headings should follow a logical, nested structure.\n\n### Environments\n\n_No response_\n\n### Suggested Fix\n\n_No response_\n\n### Reference\n\nWCAG: [Success Criterion 1.3.1 Info and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#info-and-relationships)\nWCAG-T: [G141: Organizing a page using headings](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/general/G141)\nother:[Headings and paragraphs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Headings_and_paragraphs)\n\n### What is your operating system?\n\nNone\n\n### Web browser and version\n\n_No response_",

My plugin is loaded (I see my logs), but the [extendMarkdownPageData](vscode-file://vscode-app/usr/share/code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html) function is never called during the build, even though I have many markdown files in my [docs](vscode-file://vscode-app/usr/share/code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html) folder.\n\nHere’s a minimal version of my plugin:\n\n```\n// src/plugins/git-commit-info/index.js\nconst { exec } = require('child_process');\n\nfunction getLastCommitHashAsync(filePath) {\n  return new Promise((resolve) => {\n    exec(`git log -n 1 --pretty=format:%h -- \\\"${filePath}\\\"`, { encoding: 'utf8' }, (err, stdout) => {\n      if (err) return resolve(null);\n      resolve(stdout.trim());\n    });\n  });\n}\n\nconsole.log('[git-commit-info] Plugin loaded');\n\nmodule.exports = function (context, options) {\n  return {\n    name: 'docusaurus-plugin-git-commit-info',\n    async extendMarkdownPageData(mdData) {\n      console.log('[git-commit-info] mdData:', mdData);\n      // ...rest of logic...\n      return mdData;\n    },\n  };\n};\n```\n\nAnd in my docusaurus.config.js I add it like this:\n\n```\nplugins: [\n  require.resolve('./src/plugins/git-commit-info'),\n  // other plugins...\n],\n```\n\nBut the hook is never triggered.\n\nWhat I have tried so far:\n\nI confirmed that my plugin is being loaded by adding [console.log('[git-commit-info] Plugin loaded');] at the top level, and I see this message during the build.\nI added multiple [console.log]  statements inside the [extendMarkdownPageData] function to check if it is ever called and to inspect the [mdData] object.\nI verified that I have many markdown files in my [docs] directory, and they are referenced in my sidebar.\nI tried running the build with different Docusaurus versions.\nI also considered moving the plugin to remarkPlugins, but I understand this is not the correct approach for Docusaurus content plugins.\nDespite these steps, the extendMarkdownPageData function is never called during the build.\n\nMy questions:\nIs [extendMarkdownPageData](vscode-file://vscode-app/usr/share/code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html) only called for plugins loaded as part of the docs content pipeline (e.g., via docs.plugins in [docusaurus.config.js](vscode-file://vscode-app/usr/share/code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html)), and not for plugins in the main plugins array?\nShould I add my plugin to the docs.plugins array instead?\nIs there a recommended way to hook into the docs processing pipeline to add metadata to each doc page?\nIs there anything else I might be missing?\nThank you for your help!\n", "Thank you!

I don't have a \"plan\" in the standard sense. I am working on software that provides a GUI for \"plan builder\" for running my experiment. \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/498da074-9fd5-45e4-90ca-0caf5061c4b0)\n\nIn general, it can be summarized to the plan like this:\n\n```\ndevices = [motor0, motor1, motor2, detector0,....]\nmonitor = [motor0, motor1, motor2,...]\nunmonitor_before_read = [motor2,motor1]\ndef plan():\n    yield from bps.open_run()\n    yield from bps.trigger_and_read(devices)\n    for motor in monitor:\n        yield from bps.monitor(motor, name=motor.name+\"_monitor\")\n\n    # >>> generated by \"plan builder\"\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            for m in unmonitor_before_read:\n                yield from bps.unmonitor(m)\n            yield from bps.trigger_and_read(devices)\n            for m in unmonitor_before_read:\n                yield from bps.monitor(m,name=m.name+\"_monitor\")\n    # << generated by \"plan builder\"\n    \n    yield from bps.close_run()\n```\nSo I start and interrupt the monitors depending on the inner plans. As I said before, the error appears randomly, so I can't reproduce it in the simplified plan. I do not exclude that \"plan builder\" generates code with errors, as this project is in its early stage.\nA simple copy of the `_listeners` dict solves the problem, so I decided to share it with the community...\n" ],

This issue occurs after enabling the practice tab and can be consistently reproduced.\n\n\n### URL of the page where the issue is observed.\n\nN/A\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Assign yourself the Curriculum Admin role.\n\n2. Generate:\n\n    - A dummy math classroom\n\n    - A dummy topic\n\n    - A dummy skill\n\n3. Add the dummy topic to the math classroom via http://localhost:8181/classroom-admin.\n\n4. In the Topic Editor, add the dummy skill to a subtopic.\n\n5. Check the \"Show practice tab to learners\" option.\n\n6. Go to the topic's page and open the Revision tab.\n\n7. Resize the browser window while on the Revision tab.\n\n8. Observe the formatting of the mat-card in the body.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe layout of the mat-card should adapt responsively and remain well-formatted, similar to how it behaves in the Learn page(http://localhost:8181/learn/math/dummy-topic-one/practice).\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/460c1fa2-e90d-4ab6-be00-4a2093723b55)\n\n### Screenshots/Videos\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d8ceab3-a026-41dc-b9f1-62023627e999)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f8229d5-d387-470c-812e-623ddba5a355)\n\n### What device are you using?\n\nDesktop, Mobile\n\n### Operating System\n\nMacOS\n\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Browser version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Tips for developers\n\nBefore addressing the bug, please identify which PR caused the issue (you can follow the steps [here](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/How-to-find-the-commit-which-introduced-a-bug)). If you identify the PR, comment on the issue with a link to it. If not, mention the commit hash of the oldest commit you saw the bug on (and the month and year it was made in).\n\nThen, please leave a comment with details of the approach that you plan to take to fix the issue (see [example](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/issues/19157#issuecomment-1858788463)).\n\n**Note:** If this is your first Oppia issue, please make sure to follow our guidelines for [choosing an issue](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Contributing-code-to-Oppia#choosing-a-good-first-issue) and [setting things up](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Contributing-code-to-Oppia#setting-things-up). You will also need to show a demo of the fix working correctly on your local machine. Thanks!\n",

      "description" : "### Bug description\n\nWhen configuring dashboard filters with the \"Values are dependent on other filters\" option, the system prevents creating bi-directional dependencies upfront by showing a \"Cyclic dependency detected\" message. However, it allows creating the same dependency indirectly after saving the initial filter configuration.\n\n1. If Filter A is set to depend on Filter B, the system blocks setting Filter B to depend on Filter A immediately, showing a \"Cyclic dependency detected\" message.\n2. However, if Filter A is saved with the dependency on Filter B, the system later allows editing Filter B to create the reverse dependency, effectively forming a bi-directional (cyclic) dependency.\n\nThis behavior is inconsistent and might lead to unexpected filter behavior. It appears to contradict the intended prevention of cyclic dependencies.\nHow to reproduce the bug\n\n1. Create a dashboard filter (e.g., Filter A) with a dependency on another filter (e.g., Filter B) by enabling the Values are dependent on other filters option.\n2. Save the filter configuration.\n3. Open the dashboard filter configuration again, select Filter B, and set it to depend on Filter A.\n4. Save the changes.\n\n## Expected results\n\nThe system should prevent bi-directional (cyclic) dependencies for all filter types, not just date filters. Users should not be able to create a cyclic dependency by editing the filters after saving the initial configuration.\n\n## Actual results\n\nThe platform allows creating cyclic dependencies indirectly after the initial configuration, even though it prevents it upfront. This behavior is inconsistent and may lead to unexpected filter behavior.\n\n### Screenshots/recordings\n\n_No response_\n\n### Superset version\n\nmaster / latest-dev\n\n### Python version\n\n3.11\n\n### Node version\n\n18 or greater\n\n### Browser\n\nChrome\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Checklist\n\n- [x] I have searched Superset docs and Slack and didn't find a solution to my problem.\n- [x] I have searched the GitHub issue tracker and didn't find a similar bug report.\n- [x] I have checked Superset's logs for errors and if I found a relevant Python stacktrace, I included it here as text in the \"additional context\" section.",

      "description" : "Currently when a user presses enter, the profile page at the top of the results list is what loads. However, consider how Google treats this (screenshot below).\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17221652/118880440-dc58bf00-b8bf-11eb-8d7f-20e752a01733.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17221652/118880777-41141980-b8c0-11eb-8b0c-4b5eca9ee53a.png)\r\n\r\nI am not suggesting that we use auto-complete (though that is certainly an interesting idea) but notice that in this instance if one was to press \"enter\" Google would not bring you to search results for \"gordon college bennett center\" but rather what I typed - \"gordon college.\" This contrasts to our quick Header People Search, which just assumes you meant the top result if you press enter (which is more like the first screenshot).\r\n\r\nWhat if instead, pressing enter takes you to People Search with pre-filled in entries _based on_ the top result. For example, entering \"Cam\" into the Header People Search like this first image would lead to the page in the second image because the top result matched using first name.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17221652/118881598-46be2f00-b8c1-11eb-9822-a53ce80209e6.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17221652/118881657-50e02d80-b8c1-11eb-8db3-8d3efa947181.png)\r\n\r\nHowever, if \"Campo\" is typed, the top result is based on the last name \"Campoli\" so it should lead to the appropriate page.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17221652/118882034-b6341e80-b8c1-11eb-80d4-a861c3e2549c.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17221652/118882191-e8de1700-b8c1-11eb-97a9-c9fafe73e9ae.png)\r\n\r\nFor the use case that a first _and_ last name is entered in some fashion, intuitively both these sections would be filled. So if one enters \"Cam A\" the People Search results for first name \"Cam\" and last name \"A\" should appear.\r\n\r\nAs another use case, perhaps if there is only one result for a given search criterium, we can go straight to that particular profile like we are currently with all search results. That may be debatably less consistent, but a good practical idea to consider.\r\n",

      "comments" : [ "I wonder if it would be beneficial to modify the people search page to have a generic search bar that runs off of similar functionality to the quick people search bar. Then, you could have an \"advanced search\" button that would switch the view to our existing people search page (with all of the more specific fields & filters). This would be more like traditional search pages as it still allows for the basic search with a results page.\r\n\r\nOnce we did that, we would be able to pass a generic query parameter (like \"Cam\" in this case) and it would bring up all of the results that you would have seen in the quick search bar previously. I think that makes the most UX sense, but I welcome input from @EjPlatzer @ChrisImagineer .", "I'm not sure I see the use case for having the People Search page duplicate the functionality of the quick search bar. Given that the quick search bar is visible from every page (as long as you're authenticated), no one would ever need to use the People Search page for the \"non-advanced\" search features - they can simply use the search bar.\r\n\r\nGiven that, it seems like the only reason to have the simple search is to make it easier for us as developers to pass search values from the search bar to the people search page. Assuming that's something we want to do (which I'm not convinced it is), we shouldn't default to this implementation just because it's the easiest.\r\n\r\nConsider, for example, why someone would want to go from the search bar to the People Search page: they weren't able to find what they were looking for from the search bar. If I couldn't find what I wanted to in the search bar, and then was re-directed to a page that displayed the exact same search bar with the exact same results, I would be a mixture of frustrated and disappointed.\r\n\r\nI think instead, if we did want to redirect to the People Search page automatically, we should show the current search page and populate the fields with the person's search bar query. That would mean naively putting their search into the first name field if they only put one word in, but that's still better than showing them a bigger version of the same thing they were just looking at.\r\n\r\nFor the record, I don't think hitting enter in the search bar should redirect someone to the People Search page. Instead, we should adjust the highlighting so that the first element in the results is highlighted by default:\r\n<img width=\"288\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35319956/166314896-2df85ce4-df1e-44d2-89b4-e2bb642c31a0.png\">\r\nThis way it's more clear to the user what will happen if they hit enter.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we could include a \"advanced search\" link at the bottom of the search bar results list that redirects to the People Search page (possibly pre-filled with their search bar query). So when someone scrolls through all the search bar results without finding what they were looking for they can go straight to advanced search. That seems like a more natural and fluid set of use cases in my opinion.", "I agree with Evan.  We should highlight the top entry by default to make the current behavior clearer.  Already, using up/down arrows highlights the other entries, and \"enter\" goes to the page for the selected user.  So the only flaw is not starting with the top item highlighted. " ],

Schema Refactor (Supabase)\n- Identify all instances of `owner_id` across the Supabase schema (tables, relationships, foreign keys).\n- Rename the columns to `kinder_id`, preserving existing constraints.\n- Create a properly versioned SQL migration file using Supabase CLI and place it under `services/supabase/migrations/`.\n- Validate database consistency after the rename through Supabase CLI and dashboard tools.\n\n### 2. Backend Adjustments (`services/supabase`)\n- Refactor all code references to `owner_id` across query logic, types, and service utilities.\n- Ensure all affected endpoints and mutations behave as expected with the updated schema.\n\n### 3. Frontend Integration (`apps/web`)\n- Update Supabase queries, types, and hooks that reference `owner_id`.\n- Refactor relevant components or forms handling project ownership or user metadata.\n- Run and update any impacted unit tests or mocks accordingly.\n\n### 4. Documentation\n- Update schema diagrams, ERD references, and technical documentation under `docs/` to reflect the updated field naming and align with project terminology.\n\n###  Deliverables\n- Fully working PR with schema + code changes.\n- A Supabase CLI-compatible SQL migration script.\n- Clear changelog and commit breakdown.\n- Optional: Schema diff or notes for internal dev reference.\n\n**ETA:** I estimate 36–48 hours for full implementation, testing, and documentation updates.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to take it! \nHappy to help standardize and improve the DB structure.\n", "# Hi there, @4c1d-V \uD83D\uDC4B You've been assigned this issue.\n\nOne invite is waiting for you in your email.

I'm interested in helping out, but I couldn't find any `beman/ranges_and_views` repo in the Beman Organization.\n\nIt's inactive, so it needs help.  Right now we have any_view and utf_view which are c++29 things --  and they're taking the approach of a single repo per range/view.  So I think that's likely what we should do until we have a big enough collection of range things to put them together -- which sounds like a packaging thing.  So repo named something like `concat_view`.  \n\nSo basically you'd need to clone examplar and do the chore of replacing things.

I'll take a look at that PR; it looks interesting.\n\nNow coming to the actual implementation stuff:\nI think I'd like to start with one of the simpler papers (in the first comment in this issue) and not directly get started with `concat`, which was noted to be quite difficult. This will help me get used to the workflow as well as the implementation side of things, which I personally don't have too much experience with yet.\n\nIn particular, `std::views::indices` looks to me like the perfect trial grounds for that.\n\nSo, to that end, if I understood the instructions correctly, I should make a repo called `view_indices`? (I'm not exactly sure what the name should be for this one to allow for maximum clarity.)", "I looked through the `std::views::indices` paper, and to me, it looks too small to me to warrant a repo of its own.", "I did a little research and found that `.` is a valid character in repo names so we should have no issues with making repos like\n- `ranges_and_views.indices`\n- `ranges_and_views.to_input`\n- `ranges_and_views.cache_last`\n- `ranges_and_views.concat`\n\nEven though packaging is further into the future (as in, we can't think about packaging if there's nothing _to_ package \uD83D\uDE04), this _should_ make it easier for a bot or whatever to find and pick up these repos and put them together.", "So this is a bit of a naming bikeshed that we shouldn't get too concerned with because repo names can also be changed later. We have 2 view types and so far they follow the naming pattern of `type_view` -- so `utf_view` and `any_view`.  These names are succint and simple. So for the above I'd suggest `indicies_view`, `to_input_view`, etc. \n\nw.r.t. sufficient size to warrent a repo, I'm certainly sympathetic to that thought -- it feels really heavy for a < 100 sloc project.  But the issue I see, is one might start to wonder why `utf_view` and `any_view` live elsewhere and aren't part of `ranges_and_views`. After all, they are....\n\n> we can't think about packaging if there's nothing to package\n\nreally, that's the key point :) We need an implementation on the ground before anything else really matters.  Everything we're discussing here is changable later...", "> So for the above I'd suggest `indicies_view`, `to_input_view`, etc.\n\nGot it \uD83D\uDC4D.

The implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/bemanproject/indices_view).\n\nI had to do a lot of sleuthing for MacOS because there seems to have been an implementation bug of `iota_view` (which `beman::views::indices` depends on) in LLVM's `libc++`.

It's easier for us to make a review against a pull request.  So for changes in the future I suggest making an issue -- making a branch associated with that issue -- and then a request to merge to main.  Then we can have an interactive review and the CI will check various aspects of things.

Thanks for taking this on!\n", "> did the CI show the issue?\n\nYes.\n\n> Is a bug report to libc++ in order?\n\nNo. I've documented this [in the code itself](https://github.com/bemanproject/indices_view/blob/1188a7ee9ab2bdc3bd0e18abb8e5f2348b26fde7/tests/beman/indices_view/basic.test.cpp#L27-L35).\n\nThe TL;DR is that the bug was already known to LLVM ([link](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/67551)) and is fixed ([link](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/67819)) in Clang v18.1.0 onwards. However, Apple uses an older version of Clang (v17) in its XCode SDK, so the bug is still showing up. But the bug is fixed upstream (in LLVM). We simply need to wait for XCode to release a version with a recent-enough version of Clang, to remove the workaround I have in place.\n\nI also linked to a [Godbolt example](https://godbolt.org/z/fjbo87MbK) demonstrating the issue in the comments.\n\n> So for changes in the future I suggest making an issue -- making a branch associated with that issue -- and then a request to merge to main.\n\nUnderstood. sorry about that \uD83D\uDE05\n\n> Lol I suppose we haven't written this down!\n\nI think you're right. It would be great if it were written down somewhere so that people don't make the same mistake as me in the future.\n\n> I'll try to have a look over the weekend and provide feedback -- likely in the form of issues if I find things.\n\nGot it.\n\nAlso, I'm noticing that the newer repos (namely `indices_view`, `copyable_function`) are being labeled as Python repos due to the large amount of Python code in `infra/`. I think we need to do some `.git-attributes` tricks to make the repo language show up correctly.", "\n> > I'll try to have a look over the weekend and provide feedback -- likely in the form of issues if I find things.\n> \n> Got it.\n> \n> Also, I'm noticing that the newer repos (namely `indices_view`, `copyable_function`) are being labeled as Python repos due to the large amount of Python code in `infra/`.

      "description" : "**Describe the problem**\n\nEdit 4/11/2025:\n\nThis issue should be scoped to just updating how we're defining the default value of the aria-label on Spinner. Ideally we want the default value to be rendered in the props table, rather than rendering as though there isn't any default value currently.\n\n\nOriginal comment:\n\nThe `Spinner` component hardcodes `aria-label` attribute when neither `aria-label` nor `aria-labelledby` is provided.\n\nhttps://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/blob/3ba79b0c6c6e750996f6134251dc6c6bd5eeb28a/packages/react-core/src/components/Spinner/Spinner.tsx#L47\n\n**How do you reproduce the problem?**\n\nMount a `Spinner` without providing an `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`.\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nA spinner without a hardcoded English value. The component should allow consumers to use it without `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`.

Semantically having the Spinner exposed may make more sense as well than just plain text.\n> \n> At least according to MDN, either aria-label or aria-labelledby is also required on the progressbar role. \n\nArg! My fault! I completely overlooked the `progressbar` role that the Spinner SVG is using! That’s why I wasn’t fully understanding the decision of going for these default values.\n\nRegarding having both the `aria-label` and the static text, I thought it might be redundant and possibly annoying for screen reader users, especially if both contain the same message. In any case, now that I have a better understanding, I’ll rework my use of the Spinner to include only one descriptive text. Either by using `aria-labelledby` or by adding `aria-hidden` to the static text if it doesn’t provide any additional value.\n\n> That I think makes sense since just the aria-valuenow content (be it \"Loading\" or something similar) doesn't provide great context (what exactly is loading?).\n\nFully agree. \"Loading\" alone lacks the necessary context.\n\n> \n> Though I might strongly recommend against it, if `aria-hidden` is being passed to a Spinner, that should somewhat resolve the issue of having a default aria-label applied. While the aria-label will still be there, the Spinner won't be in the a11y tree.\n> \n\nNo doubts, I’ve got a long road ahead on my accessibility learning journey, as this issue has proven. That said, in my tests, when `aria-hidden` is applied, the entire Spinner is removed from the accessibility tree, including its `aria-label` (checked with Chrome and Firefox developer tools) .\n\n> I do think we can tweak the Spinner code so that the default value of aria-label is rendered in the props table, though.\n\nAgain, thank you for your enlightening explanation and please excuse me for reporting this as an issue when it clearly wasn’t one \uD83D\uDE4F ", "It's better to raise an issue that may turn out to be intended behavior than have something sneak by us, so absolutely no worries opening this! We don't know what we don't know and all, and whether it leads to us fixing/adding something to improve the user experience or just a good discussion, it's worth it.\n\nI'll edit your original comment just to note what this issue should go towards resolving (updating how we're defining the default value). If you'd be interested in working on it just let me know and I can assign you (no pressure to, though), otherwise I can put a \"good first issue\" label for others to pick it up.", "> If you'd be interested in working on it just let me know and I can assign you (no pressure to, though), otherwise I can put a \"good first issue\" label for others to pick it up.\n\nI fear I'm a bit busy these days \uD83D\uDE22 for investing the time it needs to be not only changed but also properly tested. So, I'd label it as good first issue and give others a chance to work on it.\n\nThat said, just in case could be useful for others, as far as I could check, https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-org is relying on https://github.com/reactjs/react-docgen for generating the [PropsTable](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-org/blob/main/packages/documentation-framework/components/propsTable/propsTable.js#L18). Thus, I guess it could be as simple as moving the default value to the props initialization as shown in below diff\n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/packages/react-core/src/components/Spinner/Spinner.tsx b/packages/react-core/src/components/Spinner/Spinner.tsx\nindex 77e599773..4099da094 100644\n--- a/packages/react-core/src/components/Spinner/Spinner.tsx\n+++ b/packages/react-core/src/components/Spinner/Spinner.tsx\n@@ -32,7 +32,7 @@ export const Spinner: React.FunctionComponent<SpinnerProps> = ({\n   'aria-valuetext': ariaValueText = 'Loading...',\n   diameter,\n   isInline = false,\n-  'aria-label': ariaLabel,\n+  'aria-label': ariaLabel = 'Contents',\n   'aria-labelledBy': ariaLabelledBy,\n   ...props\n }: SpinnerProps) => (\n@@ -42,9 +42,7 @@ export const Spinner: React.FunctionComponent<SpinnerProps> = ({\n     aria-valuetext={ariaValueText}\n     viewBox=\"0 0 100 100\"\n     {...(diameter && { style: { [cssDiameter.name]: diameter } as React.CSSProperties })}\n-    {...(ariaLabel && { 'aria-label': ariaLabel })}\n-    {...(ariaLabelledBy && { 'aria-labelledBy': ariaLabelledBy })}\n-    {...(!ariaLabel && !ariaLabelledBy && { 'aria-label': 'Contents' })}\n+    {...(ariaLabelledBy ? { 'aria-labelledBy': ariaLabelledBy } : { 'aria-label': ariaLabel })}\n     {...props}\n   >\n     <circle className={styles.spinnerPath} cx=\"50\" cy=\"50\" r=\"45\" fill=\"none\" />\n```\n\nHowever, this approach puts the component at risk of having neither `aria-label` nor `aria-labelledby` if the consumer passes an empty string for the former and omits the latter.

      "description" : "## TLDR\n\nIn expressions, `foo/bar` bad, `./foo/bar` good\n\n## Is your feature request related to a problem?\n\nMost path literal expressions start with `./` in practice. (if not `../`)\nThis is a good practice because it makes it clear from the start what's the role of the text that follows.\n\nIn fact the use of path literal expressions like `foo/bar.nix` is sufficiently rare that experienced Nixers are unaware of this possibility (https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/413892)\n\nPerhaps the time has come to take this convention.\n\n## Proposed solution\n\n1. Add a setting to warn or fail when a relative path is encountered that does not start with a `.`\n2. After some time, default the setting to warn by default\n\nI'd stop there, so that we can keep evaluating old expressions without significant intervention.\nOpting out of an error may be hard when multiple hosts are involved in a deployment process that involves evaluation.\n\n## Alternative solutions\n\n**Linting**. This is far less effective. We want everyone to stop using this syntax, not just those who have the knowledge and headspace for it, and we want good coverage; not just the projects that have integrated tooling.\n\n## Additional context\n\n- Similar to https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/8738\n\n- A language redesign could parse `./foo/bar` as syntax sugar for `${.}/foo/bar` or `(.)/foo` or something. We can't do that because we want to stay compatible, and that involves parsing things like `foo/bar` directly as a path literal anyway.\n\n## Checklist\n\n<!-- make sure this issue is not redundant or obsolete -->\n\n- [ ] checked [latest Nix manual] \\([source])\n- [ ] checked [open feature issues and pull requests] for possible duplicates\n\n[latest Nix manual]: https://nixos.org/manual/nix/unstable/\n[source]: https://github.com/NixOS/nix/tree/master/doc/manual/source\n[open feature issues and pull requests]: https://github.com/NixOS/nix/labels/feature\n\n---\n\nAdd :+1: to [issues you find important](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc).\n",

      "description" : "**Describe the bug**\r\nTalk back is not reading Arabic language in Audio Language dialog box \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Go to 'Place Values'\r\n2. Double tap on 'What are place values'\r\n3. Double tap on 'Audio' button\r\n4. Double tap on 'Change language' icon\r\n5. Audio Language dialog box appears\r\n6. Swipe across the various languages\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nTalk back to read all the language names including Arabic\r\n\r\n\r\n**Environment**\r\nDevice name: One plus Nord2 5G\r\nAndroid version : Android 11\r\nApp version : 0.7-alpha-d1b2827517\r\n\r\n**Explanation and suggested solution**\r\nIn `LanguageDialogFragment`, we use ` appLanguageResourceHandler.computeLocalizedDisplayName(audioLanguage)` to get the display name for ecah language. The Arabic language therefore is displayed in Arabic characters, which talkback, when localized to English, cannot read. \r\n\r\nTalkback relies on content descriptions where available, but since this list is dynamic, we can use an accessibility delegate to instruct talkback on how to read Arabic(and Hindi too).\r\n\r\nWhen creating the dialog, override the accessibility properties of the list items by accessing the AlertDialog's ListView after creation:\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\nval options = languageNameArrayList.toTypedArray<CharSequence>()\r\nval languageInterface: LanguageInterface = parentFragment as AudioFragment\r\n\r\nval alertDialog = AlertDialog.Builder(ContextThemeWrapper(activity as Context, R.style.OppiaDialogFragmentTheme))\r\n  ...\r\n    .create()\r\n\r\nalertDialog.setOnShowListener {\r\n    val listView = alertDialog.listView\r\n    for (i in 0 until listView.childCount) {\r\n        val item = listView.getChildAt(i)\r\n        item?.setAccessibilityDelegate(object : View.AccessibilityDelegate() {\r\n            override fun onInitializeAccessibilityNodeInfo(\r\n                host: View?,\r\n                info: AccessibilityNodeInfo?\r\n            ) {\r\n                super.onInitializeAccessibilityNodeInfo(host, info)\r\n                // Get the item text\r\n           \r\n                // Set content description for TalkBack\r\n                        }\r\n        })\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nreturn alertDialog\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nUI tests are expected for the submitted code.\r\n",

For devices where this setting is not set to Arabic, this results in any Arabic words being skipped.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-07-12 at 12 38 19 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17b33f5d-1e10-4ab2-b33b-042bbd90f4c9)\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the current behavior means that the other languages in the list _aren't_ being read in their native TTS languages, which can be confusing to understand (eg. the Chinese characters for Mandarin Chinese are read in a hard-to-understand English TTS 'accent'). \r\n\r\n**Proposed Approach**\r\nUpdate `AppLanguageResourceHandler::computeLocalizedDisplayName` so that it returns a `SpannableString` instead of a `String` and wrap the returned string with `LocaleString.` By doing so, we can specify a locale that allows TalkBack to dyanmically switch to the proper TTS voice based on the language. This change would also require updating the `OptionsAudioLanguageViewModel` and `AudioLanguageSelectionViewModel` display language property to use `SpannableString` instead of `String.` \r\n\r\nLet me know if these are the methods/files that should be updated in this fix, thanks!\r\n\r\n", "Hi @elin4046, thanks for researching this. I have a few follow ups:\r\n- Typically, we don't use Locale directly in the codebase. However, if you can create a function in  the `OppiaLocale` class, it might work.\r\n- Configuring locale specific tts voice is technically out of scope for this issue. However, if it is an automatic side effect of the fix, then we can test it out and get product feedback on it. \r\n\r\n\r\nDo you mind  trying this fix and doing a screen recording so we can see what it is like?\r\n\r\n**Additional Context**\r\nThe Oppia app is set up to use the device language by default, and if the device is configure in mandarin for example, most tts will be in mandarin. However, for app strings, mandarin is not one of the translated languages we currently support, and talkback relies on content descriptions to describe the app, so for untranslated strings will default to English.", "@theayushyadav11, here's another issue to look at.

That would have the benefit of keeping the Briefcase docs on the Briefcase page, but would ensure that multiple versions say aligned.", "Thinking out loud....\r\n\r\nWhat if we leverage git submodules?\r\n\r\nIn this way, a new repo would contain the common documentation and the project repos would add this new repo as a submodule; then the docs could be built using a single source of truth for common documentation.\r\n\r\nFor instance: https://github.com/davidfischer/sphinx-with-submodules", "Put together a quick PoC.\r\n\r\nIn a [copy](https://github.com/rmartin16/briefcase-test) of the Briefcase repo, I added a new [repo](https://github.com/rmartin16/beeware-common-docs-test) as a [submodule](https://github.com/rmartin16/briefcase-test/tree/main/docs) in the `docs` directory. Then, I [reference](https://github.com/rmartin16/briefcase-test/blob/467fafe36679c579c0400f20603654295785e2a1/docs/index.rst?plain=1#L18) the `common-1.rst` file from the Briefcase's `index.rst`.\r\n\r\nproject repo: https://github.com/rmartin16/briefcase-test\r\ncommon doc repo: https://github.com/rmartin16/beeware-common-docs-test\r\n\r\nThis all works rather seamlessly, IMO. There will need to be a workflow to bump the submodule commit in the project repos when the common doc repo is updated, though.\r\n\r\n[edit] I guess a major issue this is likely to create is unaware contributors trying to build docs without the submodule....since `git` apparently doesn't clone submodules by default. So, anyone trying to build docs will need to run `git submodule update --init` or have run `git clone --recurse-submodules` initially...", "> What if we leverage git submodules?\r\n\r\nThat's definitely one way to avoid reproducing content; I'm not sure how I feel about it, though. I've historically avoided submodules unless I absolutely have to use them - I've found them to be one of those features that superficially works, but ends up making your life a whole lot more complicated in the long run (especially for contributors that haven't got experience with submodules - which is most of them).\r\n\r\nAt the risk of re-inventing the wheel - I wonder if it might be more reliable to use the same general approach, but build the subrepo cloning part as a build pre-processing step using regular git cloning.", "> I've found them to be one of those features that superficially works, but ends up making your life a whole lot more complicated in the long run (especially for contributors that haven't got experience with submodules - which is most of them).\r\n\r\nThis is fair and definitely one of my concerns for a submodule.\r\n\r\n> At the risk of re-inventing the wheel - I wonder if it might be more reliable to use the same general approach, but build the subrepo cloning part as a build pre-processing step using regular git cloning.\r\n\r\nhmm...this definitely ventures in to wheel reinvention territory.\r\n\r\nWhile this approach avoids the submodule, it introduces ambiguities that the submodule makes explicit. Notably, the current version of the \"common docs\" incorporated in to any single project's published docs is implicit. Now, we can create workflows around ensuring any updates committed to the \"common docs\" are more or less immediately pushed to dependent repos....but that doesn't remove the inherent implicit nature of which version of the \"common docs\" is being used.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if we're willing to automate the management of pulling and building docs from a remote repo, then it seems much more trivial to simply have `tox` ensure the submodule is initialized and updated prior to building the docs....rather than trying to manually clone a repo and add it to the project's docs.\r\n\r\nBut, even then, the \"common docs\" commit used for the submodule in a project repo still needs to be maintained. So, either way, we need a process to ensure updates in the \"common docs\" are disseminated to relevant repos and their docs are republished.\r\n\r\nGiven the submodule is only necessary to build the docs...and the only real way to build the docs is to run `tox`, I think much of the concern of contributors getting caught up in having to understand submodules can be avoided. That said, I don't have strong feelings and don't have much experience managing a submodule over time.", "> > At the risk of re-inventing the wheel - I wonder if it might be more reliable to use the same general approach, but build the subrepo cloning part as a build pre-processing step using regular git cloning.\r\n> \r\n> hmm...this definitely ventures in to wheel reinvention territory.\r\n> \r\n> While this approach avoids the submodule, it introduces ambiguities that the submodule makes explicit.\r\n\r\nThat would depend a bit on the implementation - we could make our implementation use specific git hash or similar. However, at the very least, a non-trivial re-implementation of a not-insignificant portion of git submodules would be required.\r\n\r\n> Given the submodule is only necessary to build the docs...and the only real way to build the docs is to run `tox`, I think much of the concern of contributors getting caught up in having to understand submodules can be avoided. \r\n\r\nThat's a fair point. My experience is that the core git submodule implementation \"works\" - it's just near-impossible for a normal human to consistently drive correctly. These problems stem from the fact that submodules aren't deeply integrated into the \"default\" git workflow, so you end up with stale checkouts, or incompatible checkouts, or something else like that. \r\n\r\nIf we can make the existence of the submodules completely transparent to the end user - so running `tox e docs/docs-lint/docs-live` *completely* manages submodule cloning, updating, etc; and the existence of the submodule doesn't impact on any other development behavior (e.g., causing issues switching between branches), then this might be an approach worth pursuing.\r\n", "A sync between the Toga and Briefcase contribution guides is in progress. \n\nThere is a somewhat significant amount of duplicated content between the two code contribution guides, and the documentation guides are 99.9% the same. I feel the idea of consolidating content is a discussion worth continuing.\n\nI put some time into looking into whether there were any options, inherent to Sphinx, available for consolidating content. As far as I can tell, Sphinx does not support any features that would do this natively. Directly cloning the repo would avoid submodules, but the issue of being able to edit the common docs in the wrong location seems as possible with this method as with submodules. Other than this issue, the rest could be made relatively transparent to the user.\n\nAnother issue that came up is searchability. Users have reported that it's difficult to find info with the docs being spread across multiple repos. Something that is worth looking into for this are [Read the Docs subprojects](https://docs.readthedocs.com/platform/stable/subprojects.html). This would require having a \"primary\" documentation repo, perhaps on `beeware/beeware`, that the rest of the tools are added to as subprojects. Then, the docs would be searchable across all projects - the project-wide search is available from the \"primary\" project, as well as any of the subprojects. The search has a checkbox for \"Include subprojects\" and that is how you choose to search all the projects at once - there is an [active issue](https://github.com/readthedocs/addons/issues/22) open to add the ability to configure it to be checked by default. This change may effect some of the plan [here](https://github.com/beeware/beeware/discussions/522#discussioncomment-13502604), so it's something we would need to discuss. ", "> Another issue that came up is searchability. Users have reported that it's difficult to find info with the docs being spread across multiple repos.\n\nOnce the docs are all moved to beeware.org subdomains, it'll become possible to do this with an external search engine that supports filtering by domain, e.g. Google has `site:beeware.org`." ],

We’ve noticed that other users have reported similar issues, as seen in the forum thread you are mentioning. However, we kindly ask that such discussions be continued there in order to keep issues at one place and as this tracker is intended for framework-related issues. Once solution is found and its only a matter of integration, a PR https://github.com/armbian/build/pulls should be opened - by anyone.\n\nThis particular bug appears to be tied to the specific hardware/kernel combination and not related to Armbian OS or assembly itself. It's worth noting that this issue does not manifest on Raspberry Pi or x86 platforms, which benefit from significantly larger development resources — for instance, Raspberry Pi OS has a dedicated full-time staff and a yearly budget exceeding 1 million USD. In contrast, Armbian relies heavily on community support and volunteer contributions with budget ([taken from here](https://github.com/sponsors/armbian)). And we compile 80 different kernels for docents of platforms. Most of them are not even close to level of Raspberry Pi. And even there, users finds issues https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/issues\n\nAs frustrating as it may be, the reality in open source is that some issues—especially those requiring deep investigation—can take years to resolve. We fully understand the inconvenience and appreciate your patience and contributions." ],

I see @benoit-cty already started [a branch to migrate ](https://github.com/mlco2/codecarbon/pull/815) maybe it can be discussed in that PR?\n- About test deps not separated from build deps.

It would be really nice if triggering the rename action allowed us to alias (or change an existing alias) an imported module and automatically update all relevant module selects. Triggering the action here:\n\n```gleam\nhtml.form(\n  [\n    attribute.method(\"POST\"),\n//   ^^^^ I put my cursor here and trigger the rename\n    attribute.action(\"...\"),\n    attribute.enctype(\"...\"),\n  ],\n  [...],\n)\n```\n\nWould result in this change:\n\n```diff\n- import lustre/attribute\n+ import lustre/attribute as attr\n\nhtml.form(\n  [\n-   attribute.method(\"POST\"),\n-   attribute.action(\"...\"),\n-   attribute.enctype(\"...\"),\n+   attr.method(\"POST\"),\n+   attr.action(\"...\"),\n+   attr.enctype(\"...\"),\n  ],\n  [...],\n)\n```\n\nWhat do you think?",

In Android i was able to change the bufferConfig prop and i tested in a real Android device and it works, but in iOS, i changed the prop `preferredForwardBufferDuration` but the video still stop playing after some seconds because the loaded buffer isn't enough to continue playing the video. Moreover, i tested setting `automaticallyWaitsToMinimizeStalling` to false but it doesn't work. \r\nWhat i understood is that if i put `preferredForwardBufferDuration=15` it means that the player will load 15 video seconds into the memory before continue playing the video but it doesn't work like that.

This works, however, the user must tap on the paused thumbnail in order to see the controls. The controls should show by default, not require the user to tap on the still image.\r\n\r\n## Why it is needed\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Please tell us a bit more of why you want this feature to be added, what's its origin\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Possible implementation\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  It really helps if you could describe from a technical POV how this new feature would work, which code it rely on, etc\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Code sample\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Please show how the new code could work, if doable\r\n-->\r\n",

However, when editing the name of the task, sometimes the app lets you keep the line break on it.\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d4a8beb-35d4-4f34-8042-5e5e31deeaaa\n\nThis example was a simplification of the issue, but some apps / sites add a invisible line break after the copied text, so this issue might appear more often.\n\n(TBH it doesn't seem like this is a deal breaker, but I can imagine this having some potential issues if any other area of the app is not expecting line breaks at all on this field, so I am creating this issue just in case).\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Open any Note-taking app to test this out\n2. Write any sentence in two lines, with an Enter line-break. Example:\n\n```\nthis is \na test\n```\n\n3. Copy this text\n4.

This affects the visual clarity of the UI and makes the design appear broken or misaligned.\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n\n- Open the Enatega customer app\n- Wait for the app to load the \"Welcome to Enatega\" page\n- Observe the map displayed on this screen\n- Verify whether the map loads properly and is interactive, or if it appears as a static image, distorted, or fails to render correctly\n\n**Expected behavior**\nAll icons, including location icons, should be fully visible and properly aligned with adequate padding/margin to prevent clipping.\n\n**Screenshots**\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3bd57de-2042-49b6-8aa9-c316bdb3928c)\n\nSmartphone (please complete the following information):\n\nDevice: Samsung A15\n\nOS: Android 14\n\nApp Version: [insert if known]\n\n**Additional context**\nThis is likely a UI rendering issue caused by insufficient padding, margin, or incorrect icon scaling. Fixing this will improve the visual consistency and usability of the app.",

This causes delays, unnecessary follow-ups, and risks around incorrect or incomplete releases.\nWe believe we already know the core information needed to initiate a release (e.g., release identifier, target component, identity version). By formalizing how this is collected, we can empower engineers to submit higher-quality requests and reduce the coordination burden on the release manager.\nWhat we aim to do in this task:\nDefine the minimum required fields engineers must provide when requesting a release (e.g., release identifier, target component, identity version). Create a lightweight, accessible format for collecting this information, for example a Slack form. Align with the release manager to ensure this structure covers all needed details.\n\n## Goal\n\nA clearly documented and easy-to-use mechanism for engineers to request a release, integrated into our current channel #top-monorepo-release.\n",

You would need to create a target in a project that is an executable, and then those built plugins need to be compiled before the target that needs them.

An important piece is the [PackageInfoMapper](https://github.com/tuist/tuist/blob/main/cli/Sources/TuistLoader/SwiftPackageManager/PackageInfoMapper.swift) that does the majority of the mapping from SwiftPM definition to the Tuist definition. This mapping currently does not support SwiftPM plugins. If you search for `macro` in that file, you'll see the important bits for converting a macro into the Tuist definition.", "Hi!\n\nI’m doing some experiments and would like to clarify one point.\n\nI selected [SwiftLintPlugin](https://github.com/lukepistrol/SwiftLintPlugin/blob/main/Package.swift#L26) as a sample and noticed that the plugin depends on `SwiftLintBinary.artifactbundle.zip` instead of an xcframework.\n\nDoes this mean we would need to introduce a new architecture to handle this pattern properly? Or is there an existing approach that I might have overlooked?", "> Does this mean we would need to introduce a new architecture to handle this pattern properly? Or is there an existing approach that I might have overlooked?\n\nYou will need to unzip the bundle when generating the project – and then grab the `.xcframework` that should be inside the archive.

Reading out the flags as an integer doesn't seem immediately useful to me, I'm not clear what a user would be able to do with the raw value.

Right now [the logs proto field](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/blob/main/opentelemetry/proto/logs/v1/logs.proto#L185) says it only contains W3C trace context flags, which I've been told should be considered read-only in Collector processors until someone comes to us with a compelling use case for writing to them. At a minimum, without bitwise operators they're going to be hard to work with.\r\n\r\nUnless users are looking for only access to the raw bit sequence, I think we should consider implementing something different for traces and look to update the logs context to match once we're happy with it.", "> Are you ware of any usages of that field\r\n\r\nI am not.\r\n\r\nIf the current logs implementation is not useful I am ok with implementing flags for spans with specific flags in mind, but I do think we should make a generic path like logs in case there is some custom function someone wants to build that does something with the raw flags.", "This issue has been inactive for 60 days.

It has good browser support and would allow us to marginally reduce the bundle size.\n\n---------------\n\n_Do not alter or remove anything below. The following sections will be managed by moderators only._\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n\n* Use of `cloneDeep` within the codebase should be replaced with `structuredClone`.\n\n## Implementation Brief\n\n* Wait until we upgrade our version of Node to at least `17` (probably `18`), see #6026.\n* Replace every import of `cloneDeep` with `structuredClone`, eg `cloneDeep( object )` to `structuredClone( object )`.\n* At the time of writing, we have usage in the following files:\n  * `assets/js/modules/analytics-4/datastore/properties.test.js`\n  * `assets/js/modules/analytics-4/components/module/ModulePopularPagesWidgetGA4/index.js`\n  * `assets/js/modules/analytics-4/components/dashboard/DashboardAllTrafficWidgetGA4/UserCountGraph.js`\n  * `assets/js/modules/analytics-4/components/dashboard/DashboardAllTrafficWidgetGA4/UserDimensionsPieChart.js`\n  * `assets/js/modules/analytics-4/utils/data-mock.js`\n  * `assets/js/modules/reader-revenue-manager/components/settings/SettingsEdit.stories.js`\n  * `assets/js/modules/reader-revenue-manager/datastore/publications.test.js`\n  * `assets/js/components/GoogleChart/utils.js`\n  * `assets/js/components/wp-dashboard/WPDashboardPopularPagesGA4.js`\n  * `storybook/utils/resetGlobals.js`\n\n### Test Coverage\n\n* Tests should continue to pass without change; no new tests are needed.\n\n## QA Brief\n\n* <!-- One or more bullet points for how to test that the feature works as expected. -->\n\n## Changelog entry\n\n* <!-- One sentence summarizing the PR, to be used in the changelog. -->\n",

You need an event (watcher or vue lifecycle) to call the function which adds the css class. In my case the taskDates prop is updated each time the user changes the current month.

You probably see something like \"We couldn’t find any repositories matching ...\" then click \"Issues\" in the left navigation.\r\n    - You can also filter by appending e. g. \"state:open\" to the search string.\r\n    - More info on search syntax within github: https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues\r\n    \r\n* This repository https://github.com/nextcloud/server/issues is *only* for issues within the Nextcloud Server code. This also includes the apps: files, encryption, external storage, sharing, deleted files, versions, LDAP, and WebDAV Auth\r\n  \r\n* SECURITY: Report any potential security bug to us via our HackerOne page (https://hackerone.com/nextcloud) following our security policy (https://nextcloud.com/security/) instead of filing an issue in our bug tracker.  \r\n\r\n* The issues in other components should be reported in their respective repositories: You will find them in our GitHub Organization (https://github.com/nextcloud/)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- Please keep this note for other contributors -->\r\n\r\n### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the \uD83D\uDC4D [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are interested into the same feature.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add. It's just extra noise for everyone subscribed to this issue.\r\n* Subscribe to receive notifications on status change and new comments. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nThere is no obvious intuitive way to cancel editing a user. This is confusing for first time admins.\r\n\r\n*Steps to reproduce*\r\n\r\n1. Login to NC as an Admin\r\n2. Create a new user, setting a username and display name\r\n3. Edit the user\r\n4. Change the user's display name\r\n5. Realise that you did not actually want to change the user's display name\r\n\r\nNow there is only the \"OK\" button with the check mark icon to submit your changes.\r\nBut there is no \"Cancel\" button to neglect your changes and go back to the original display name.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nAdd a second button \"Cancel\" next to the \"OK\" button. Clicking the \"Cancel\" button should ignore (and maybe revert) any changes you have made to the user's properties and return back to displaying the user's original properties.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe only way I have found to effectively cancel editing a user was by reloading the entire page (F5).\r\nHowever, that is not immediately obvious to newcomers.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n",

Still, the issue remains that once you press `Enter` in any of the input fields (or click the arrow button) there is no easy way to undo any changes - as @yskwon38  also stated.\r\n\r\nBut to me it seems now that the missing `Cancel` button is only a symptom of a larger issue, namely that the user editing UI is not very intuitive and actually confusing.\r\nI think the fact that you had to create an elaborate screenshot and write some text explaining how user editing works kind of supports my opinion.\r\nI know, one should read the manual, but I would think that editing a user should be a straight-forward task that requires little to no documentation at all.\r\n\r\nAnother example: I edit a user, change the user name, and click on `Done`. I reload the page and my change is gone / hasn't been saved. In this case the `Done` button actually **is** the `Cancel` button. No other form I used so far behaves this way.\r\n\r\nIn other (user) editing forms I usually see two different approaches:\r\n1. Editing a field and moving on to the next field (`onblur`) directly persists the changes\r\n2. Changes are only persisted after clicking a `Save` button at the end of the form. Clicking the `Cancel` button resets all changes made so far.\r\n\r\nI would like to suggest to change the NC user editing to the second approach. The currently used approach where one has to manually \"apply\" changes for every single input field by clicking the `arrow` button (without having the chance of undoing it) is - at least for me - a counter-intuitive approach, which leads to a sometimes frustrating user experience. Because it is so different from what I am used to from other forms and user editing is not a task that I do so often that I will get used to this approach. Basically, I have to think \"how did this work again?\" every time I start using NC's user management.\r\n\r\nAnd I am not sure if a simple re-labelling or adding tooltips to buttons will actually be enough to improve this. See my example above where the `Done` button label would actually have to get a different label depending on whether any input fields were edited **and** saved (`Done`) or just edited but **not** saved (`Cancel`).", "> But to me it seems now that the missing `Cancel` button is only a symptom of a larger issue, namely that the user editing UI is not very intuitive and actually confusing.\r\n> I think the fact that you had to create an elaborate screenshot and write some text explaining how user editing works kind of supports my opinion.\r\n> I know, one should read the manual, but I would think that editing a user should be a straight-forward task that requires little to no documentation at all.\r\n\r\nI think there might have been a misunderstanding.

My apologies.\r\n\r\nYou are also correct, that when writing the original feature request I missed that there already is kind of a `Cancel` button. It just has a confusing label: the checkmark icon and the `Done` tooltip.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is only true for the text fields. The multi-select fields for group and group admin persist any changes immediately.\r\nSo that is another confusing inconsistency, I think.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I would still prefer a solution that gets rid of the `arrow` buttons and any auto-save-on-change completely, and just uses one `Save` and one `Cancel` button for the whole form.\r\n\r\nBut as you said, it might make sense to discuss such a change first with the nextcloud team before starting to work on it.\r\n", "I think there should be only one way to save changes and the \"done\" checkmark should be the way to go.

      "description" : "## Issue summary\n- While designing the statement distribution subsystem I've noticed that it needs to send messages to `Candidate Backing` subsystems, and after a look into the `Candidate Backing` it will also need to send messages to `Statement Distribution`\n\n- Currently, in Gossamer we have packages contains a filed `message.go` that contains all the messages the subsystem can receive, and other packages that contains an inner package called `messages` that holds a file called `messages.go` that contains the messages.\n\n- In a case where two subsystems should send messages to each other they need to import the receiving subsystem to be able to instantiate the message and sent, so if all the messages stay in the subsystem package this will create an cyclic import\n\n\n## Implementation details\n\n- We should use the second approach where the subsystem has an inner package called `messages` to avoid such case.\n\n## Other information and links\n<!-- Add any other context, links or screenshots about the issue here. -->\n- `Backing -> Statement Distribution`: [link to the code](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/ec69b612bfa082ada07ceb7d8115e07f943f6815/polkadot/node/core/backing/src/lib.rs#L1697)\n- `Statement Distribution -> Backing`: [link to the code](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/ec69b612bfa082ada07ceb7d8115e07f943f6815/polkadot/node/network/statement-distribution/src/v2/mod.rs#L1959)\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n<!-- Acceptance criteria establish conditions to fulfill for the item to be complete. Usually can be a list of checkboxes.\nPlease refer to DOD for general implementation issue:\n- AC should be complete so list everything that this issue suppose to have\n- 60% test coverage. No less then 60% of coverage for newly added lines\n- If applicable Regression testing. If this issue can be tested by its won mention Regression testing. \nAcceptance criteria should be added as a check boxes (eg [] Do this) \n-->\n[] Move all the messages for each subsystems to the `messages` pkg\n\n<!-- Thank you \uD83D\uDE4F -->",

This is a place to report bugs to developers, after your server has been debugged. You can find help debugging your system on our home user forums: https://help.nextcloud.com or, if you use Nextcloud in a large organization, ask our engineers on https://portal.nextcloud.com. See also  https://nextcloud.com/support for support options.\r\n\r\nNextcloud is an open source project backed by Nextcloud GmbH. Most of our volunteers are home users and thus primarily care about issues that affect home users. Our paid engineers prioritize issues of our customers. If you are neither a home user nor a customer, consider paying somebody to fix your issue, do it yourself or become a customer.\r\n\r\nGuidelines for submitting issues:\r\n\r\n* Please search the existing issues first, it's likely that your issue was already reported or even fixed.\r\n    - Go to https://github.com/nextcloud and type any word in the top search/command bar. You probably see something like \"We couldn’t find any repositories matching ...\" then click \"Issues\" in the left navigation.\r\n    - You can also filter by appending e. g. \"state:open\" to the search string.\r\n    - More info on search syntax within github: https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues\r\n    \r\n* This repository https://github.com/nextcloud/server/issues is *only* for issues within the Nextcloud Server code. This also includes the apps: files, encryption, external storage, sharing, deleted files, versions, LDAP, and WebDAV Auth\r\n  \r\n* SECURITY: Report any potential security bug to us via our HackerOne page (https://hackerone.com/nextcloud) following our security policy (https://nextcloud.com/security/) instead of filing an issue in our bug tracker.  \r\n\r\n* The issues in other components should be reported in their respective repositories: You will find them in our GitHub Organization (https://github.com/nextcloud/)\r\n  \r\n* You can also use the Issue Template app to prefill most of the required information: https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/issuetemplate\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--- Please keep this note for other contributors -->\r\n\r\n### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the \uD83D\uDC4D [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add. It's just extra noise for everyone subscribed to this issue.\r\n* Subscribe to receive notifications on status change and new comments. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n1. create a folder \"test\"\r\n2. create a group \"test\"\r\n3. share folder \"test\" with group \"test\"\r\n4. delete group test\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\ndelete shares of group if group get deleted.\r\nif later same group name get created again (maybe with other members) it will automatically have all the shares from the past\r\n(this is also a \"security\" topic)\r\n\r\n### Server configuration\r\n\r\n**Nextcloud version:** 21.0.1\r\n",

      "description" : "### ⚠️ This issue respects the following points: ⚠️\n\n- [x] This is a **bug**, not a question or a configuration/webserver/proxy issue.\n- [x] This issue is **not** already reported on [Github](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug) OR [Nextcloud Community Forum](https://help.nextcloud.com/) _(I've searched it)_.\n- [x] Nextcloud Server **is** up to date. See [Maintenance and Release Schedule](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/wiki/Maintenance-and-Release-Schedule) for supported versions.\n- [x] I agree to follow Nextcloud's [Code of Conduct](https://nextcloud.com/contribute/code-of-conduct/).\n\n### Bug description\n\nWhen opening `/settings/user/security` below the devices and sessions section the connected devices and sessions are listed. In this section are entries like `Google Chrome - 132 (Linux)`. The entry is added as soon as the Nextcloud mobile app is connected to the Nextcloud installation and the username and password is entered in the mobile Chrome browser.\n\nThis is misleading. I think, it should be `Google Chrome - 132 (Android)`. Linux makes me think of a desktop computer or laptop running Linux.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Set up a recent Nextcloud AIO\n2. Login into the Nextcloud web interface on a desktop computer or laptop that is not running Linux and go to `/settings/user/security`\n3. Install the Nextcloud app on an Android device\n4.

      "description" : "### Question\n\nHi! I am trying to add 1 million existing Parquet files to an Iceberg table using the `add_files` procedure. I am inserting in 1000 batches of 1000 files. Every batch takes longer than the previous batch, and at this point each batch is taking around 1-2 minutes. This is much much slower than Spark, which remains consistent throughout the entire insertion. How can I speed this up? The Parquet files already have metadata so perhaps that could be exploited somehow? Below is the code I am using:\n\n\n```\nwarehouse_path = \"/warehouse\"\ncatalog = load_catalog(\n    \"pyiceberg\",\n    **{\n        'type': 'sql',\n        \"uri\": f\"sqlite:///{warehouse_path}/pyiceberg_catalog.db\",\n        \"warehouse\": f\"file://{warehouse_path}\",\n    },\n)\ncatalog.create_namespace_if_not_exists(\"default\")\n\n# Load the batches of files to import\nbatches = os.listdir(args.file_dir)\nfirst_file = os.path.join(args.file_dir, \"batch_0\", os.listdir(os.path.join(args.file_dir, \"batch_0\"))[0])\n\n# Create table using schema of the first file\ndf = pq.read_table(first_file)\ntable = catalog.create_table_if_not_exists(\n    f\"default.{args.table}\",\n    schema=df.schema,\n)\n\nbatch_idx = 1\nfor batch_dir in batches:\n    print(f\"Adding batch {batch_idx}\")\n    batch_dir =  os.path.join(args.file_dir, batch_dir)\n    file_paths = os.listdir(batch_dir)\n    file_paths = [batch_dir + '/' + s for s in file_paths]\n    table.add_files(file_paths=file_paths)\n    batch_idx += 1\n```",

If anybody wants to take a stab, you can search for `scrollUpMain` in the codebase to see how that works. We need versions of `scrollUpView` and `scrollDownView` in `pkg/gui/global_handlers.go` that take the scroll amount as a parameter, rather than hardcoding to use `gui.UserConfig.Gui.ScrollHeight` internally. Then we can pass them the height of the view as that parameter to have us scrolling by a whole page.", "btw @sdegutis if you want to get your hands dirty with Go, this would be a good first start!", "Sorry, to clarify, I'm requesting we use <kbd>Shift-PageUp</kbd> and <kbd>Shift-PageDown</kbd> (or Ctrl-).", "Tbh I mainly solved this by just setting scroll amount to 10 in config instead of the default of 2 and using the mouse wheel to scroll, so this can be closed if you want.", "By the way @jesseduffield when I looked through the src earlier, I was surprised this was written in Go.

I've had enough exposure to Rust to feel that Go is sorely lacking in features. Especially when it comes to code re-use, Go just doesn't have much (if anything) to offer due to lack of both inheritance, mixins/traits, and generics (though generics are on the way). I've done a fairly extensive writeup on my thoughts [here](https://jesseduffield.com/Gos-Shortcomings-1/) \r\n\r\n@glendsoza Nice one. I've left a comment on that PR. As commented, there's another PR in flight that's going to make it easier to use shift/ctrl modifiers, and hopefully that'll let us use pgdown/pgup.", "@jesseduffield I agree, I came to that conclusion maybe 7 years ago. I tried Rust out and I guess it's fine if you need low-level and lightning-fast and ultra-safe code, which I do 0% of the time (and apparently neither does VS Code but it works well enough). I'm going to try my hand at a quick Electron git client in TypeScript one of these days using [simple-git](https://www.npmjs.com/package/simple-git).", "I also vote for hotkeys for whole page scrolling. `C-f/C-b` (like manpage)  and `C-u/C-d` (like tig) both feels right to me. It should be configurable so there should just be a default one and let users choose what they like.", "@jesseduffield -- any update on this one? It'd be really lovely to be able to scroll by whole pages.", "As of v0.50 you can now focus the main view (by pressing `0`), and then you can navigate it using all the normal navigation keys like `.` and `,` for scrolling by page, or `<` and `>` for beginning/end.", "Given that we do now have a way of scrolling the main view both by line and by page via focusing it, I wonder if we should update the page-up/page-down keys to actually scroll by page now. Seems like lots of people are surprised that it currently defaults to only scrolling by line.\n\nOn the other hand, lots of lazygit users (myself included) have become accustomed to page-up/page-down only scrolling by lines", "@jesseduffield In this comment you only talk about scrolling by line vs. scrolling by page, but isn't the bigger difference which view they operate on? I'd expect pgup/pgdown to scroll the _current_ view (by page of course, not by line), not the main view. They would then do exactly the same as `,` and `.`, in the same way as home and end do the same as `<` and `>`.\n\nThis change makes a lot of sense to me, and I'm in favor. We still have two other ways of scrolling the main view (ctrl-d/u and J/K; they are both listed in the keybinding cheat sheets, but are otherwise not very discoverable).\n\nBut I'm probably not qualified to judge, because I rarely use the keyboard to scroll the main view; I use two fingers on the trackpad for that.", "As a vim user, I'm accustomed to `ctrl+u` and `ctrl+d` scrolling by _half pages_, and that is what I expected in the lazygit diff view (instead, it scrolls one line, just like pg up/dn). I'm very much in favor of making these scroll by page in the diff view. \n\nWhen I'm staging files for a commit, I'd like to quickly move from file to file, while being able to scroll quickly in the diff without having to switch focus back and forth between the panes. \n\nIdeally, scrolling by line should also be available somehow in this view. One suggestion would be to use `ctrl+e` and `ctrl+y` to scroll by line, just like in vim, however, I see that `ctrl+e` is already in use. `ctrl+j` and `ctrl+k` could also be agreeable, and seems to be available.", "We could also scroll alternative views by alt+down/up or ctrl+down/up", "I think a modifier + any-navigation keys applying to the current view would be good.\n\n`ctrl + ,` or `ctrl + .` applying to current view would be great. I also think we should have an alternative for line scrolling on the current view, page-up/down should really do what they say on the box imo.\n\n... I should really offer a PR rather than my opinion", "> As of v0.50 you can now focus the main view (by pressing `0`), and then you can navigate it using all the normal navigation keys like `.` and `,` for scrolling by page, or `<` and `>` for beginning/end.\n\nThanks, that's perfect!" ],

Interestingly, `IntableRaising` doesn't inherit from them so it really seems like `Intable` shouldn't either.\n\n### What is your motivation for this change?\n\nI have a type I want to be `Intable` but not `Copyable`.\n\n### Any other details?\n\n_No response_",

We need to add more to cover all the code in vllm-ascend, and there are several principles to follow:\n\n1. The overall file tree should be consistent with `vllm_ascend`\n2. The file name should be the original file name with a prefix `test_`\n3. Use `unittest` framework, make good use of mock\n4. The UTs are all running on cpu node, mock the function related to device to host\n\n### Unit tests need to add\n\n- [ ] |-- test__version.py\n- [x] |-- test_ascend_config.py\n- [ ] |-- test_attention\n- [ ] |   |-- test_attention.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_attention_v1.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_mla_v1.py\n- [ ] |-- compilation\n- [ ] |   `-- test_piecewise_backend.py\n- [ ] |-- core\n- [ ] |   |-- test_schedule_config.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_scheduler.py\n- [ ] |-- device_allocator\n- [ ] |   `-- test_camem.py\n- [ ] |-- distributed\n- [ ] |   |-- test_communicator.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_device_communicators\n- [ ] |   |   |-- test_pyhccl.py\n- [ ] |   |   `-- test_pyhccl_wrapper.py\n- [ ] |   |-- kv_transfer @Agonixiaoxiao \n- [ ] |   |   |-- test_simple_buffer.py\n- [ ] |   |   |-- test_simple_connector.py\n- [ ] |   |   |-- test_simple_pipe.py\n- [ ] |   |   `-- test_utils.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_llmdatadist_connector.py\n- [x] |   `-- test_parallel_state.py   @wangyanhui-cmss \n- [ ] |-- test_envs.py\n- [ ] |-- lora\n- [ ] |   `-- punica_wrapper\n- [ ] |       `-- test_punica_npu.py\n- [ ] |-- models\n- [ ] |   |-- test_deepseek_dbo.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_deepseek_mtp.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_deepseek_v2.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_qwen2_5_vl.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_qwen2_5_vl_without_padding.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_qwen2_vl.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_qwen3_moe.py\n- [ ] |-- multistream\n- [ ] |   |-- test_base.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_context.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_decorator.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_layers.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_metadata.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_ms_split.py\n- [ ] |-- ops\n- [ ] |   |-- test_activation.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_attention.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_cache.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_common_fused_moe.py\n- [x] |   |-- test_expert_load_balancer.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_fused_moe.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_layernorm.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_rotary_embedding.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_vocab_parallel_embedding.py\n- [ ] |-- patch\n- [ ] |   |-- platform\n- [ ] |   |   |-- patch_0_9_1\n- [ ] |   |   |-- patch_common\n- [ ] |   |   |   `-- test_test_patch_distributed.py\n- [ ] |   |   `-- patch_main\n- [ ] |   `-- worker\n- [ ] |       |-- patch_0_9_1\n- [ ] |       |-- patch_common\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_distributed.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_eagle.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_minicpm.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_multi_step_worker.py\n- [x] |       |   |-- test_patch_sampler.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_spec_decode_worker.py\n- [ ] |       |   `-- test_patch_utils.py\n- [ ] |       `-- patch_main\n- [ ] |-- test_platform.py @zhanghw0354\n- [ ] |-- quantization\n- [ ] |   |-- test_func_wrapper.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_quant_config.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_quantizer.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_w8a8.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_w8a8_dynamic.py\n- [ ] |-- sample\n- [ ] |   |-- ops\n- [ ] |   `-- test_rejection_sampler.py\n- [x] |-- test_utils.py\n- [ ] `-- worker \n- [ ] |-- test_cache_engine.py @machenglong2025\n- [ ] |-- test_draft_model_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_model_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_model_runner_v1.py\n- [ ]  |-- test_mtp_proposer_v1.py @machenglong2025\n- [ ] |-- test_multi_step_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_multi_step_worker.py\n- [ ] |-- test_pooling_model_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_worker.py @zhanghw0354\n- [ ] `-- test_worker_v1.py @zhanghw0354\n",

Having multiple inputs, such as for the NWP forecast grid + raw observations to generate the next analysis grid to more closely match how analysis files are actually generated could be helpful. Additionally, multiple outputs would be helpful, for example for #20 to output both the next NWP state and satellite image, potentially at different resolutions (i.e. HRV vs non-HRV channels for EUMETSAT), or for having more dense local outputs, it could be the global graph, and a local graph output in the decoder.\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n<!--- Why is this change important to you? How would you use it? -->\r\n<!--- How can it benefit other users? -->\r\n\r\n## Possible Implementation\r\nUpdate the latent graph processor to take multiple encoders. Multple outputs can be achieved by taking the output from the graph processor and giving it as inputs into multiple decoders. There would just need to be a way to give multiple decoder configs to the overall model.\r\n",

(why is it a priority?) #\n\nWith the librbd logs available we would be able to pinpoint issues in ceph rbd easily by backtracking the logs and helping the ceph rbd team to identify the issues easily.\n\n",

But that particular one is due to a long _segment_, which is still limited even with the OS setting changed.\n\nYou might want to look at the `.winerror` attribute (if it's there). Windows has much more fine grained error codes than POSIX, and we map a lot of different errors to ENOENT and EINVAL. Still pretty sure you can't tell specifically that the path was too long, though. Catching the error and checking the path argument that was passed in is the \"best\" way (it's not great).", "PRs are welcome :)", "Hi @ichard26, I've put together a PR for this issue.
