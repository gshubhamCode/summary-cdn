      "description" : "### Is your feature request related to a problem?\n\n- [x] Yes, it is related to a problem\n\n### Describe the feature you'd like\n\n## \uD83C\uDF1F Feature Description\nMigrate the web search functionality from Tavily Search to DuckDuckGo Search.\n\n## \uD83D\uDD0D Problem Statement\nThe current implementation of the web search feature relies on the Tavily Search API. This feature is utilized in the `handle_web_search_node` to perform web searches. The `TavilySearchTool` class in `backend/app/agents/devrel/tools/search_tool.py` directly interacts with the Tavily API. The dependency on Tavily is also specified in the project's dependencies. This migration is intended to replace Tavily Search with DuckDuckGo Search as the primary web search provider.\n\n## \uD83C\uDFAF Expected Outcome\nUpon completion, the project will use DuckDuckGo Search for all web search queries. The `langchain-tavily` and `tavily-python` dependencies will be removed from the project, and a new dependency for a DuckDuckGo search library will be added. The `handle_web_search_node` and the search tool will be updated to use the new DuckDuckGo search functionality.\n\n## \uD83D\uDCF7 Screenshots and Design Ideas\nN/A (This is a backend implementation change with no direct UI impact).\n\n## \uD83D\uDCCB Additional Context\nThe following files will be impacted by this change:\n- `backend/app/agents/devrel/tools/search_tool.py`: The `TavilySearchTool` class will need to be replaced with a new class for DuckDuckGo search.\n- `backend/app/agents/devrel/nodes/handle_web_search_node.py`: The `handle_web_search_node` will need to be updated to use the new DuckDuckGo search tool.\n- `pyproject.toml`: The `langchain-tavily` and `tavily-python` dependencies will be removed and a new dependency for DuckDuckGo search will be added.\n- `backend/app/core/config.py`: The `tavily_api_key` setting will be removed and a new setting for the DuckDuckGo API key may need to be added.\n\n### Record\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\n- [ ] I want to work on implementing this feature",

This is the GMS change I made to make that work: https://github.com/dolthub/go-mysql-server/pull/3046, but I realized that this was breaking a bunch of tests in Dolt for reasons I didn't expect, so I reverted it shortly thereafter: https://github.com/dolthub/go-mysql-server/pull/3056\n\nChanging the output of SET by itself will break many changes test in Dolt. Unfortunately I was actually trying to fix this issue, which is about the shell printing the right updates, so that got all jumbled up which let to a deeper issue which is that the `dolt sql` shell doesn't have the right information to determine when to print the Query OK line. Specifically, mysql shell will not print any of them if it's executing statements in a batch.\n\nThis is best shown here:\n\n```\n$ echo \"create table t (i int); drop table t;\" | mysql -u root -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3306 mydb\n$ mysql -u root -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3306 mydb\nWelcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \\g.\nYour MySQL connection id is 9\nServer version: 8.0.33 Dolt\n\nCopyright (c) 2000, 2023, Oracle and/or its affiliates.\n\nOracle is a registered trademark of Oracle Corporation and/or its\naffiliates. Other names may be trademarks of their respective\nowners.\n\nType 'help;' or '\\h' for help. Type '\\c' to clear the current input statement.\n\nmysql> create table t (i int);\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> drop table t;\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql>\n```\n\nYou can see that the output of the first command is empty. MySQL client knows that you are not in an interactive terminal. `dolt sql` shell doesn't actually know this, and as a result the changes I made to the shell break lots of tests because where ever we stream in statements, we print out `Query OK` in many places that aren't expected in tests.\n\nThe equivalent dolt operations:\n```\n$ echo \"create table t (i int); drop table t;\" | dolt sql\n\n\n$ dolt sql\n# Welcome to the DoltSQL shell.\n# Statements must be terminated with ';'.\n# \"exit\" or \"quit\" (or Ctrl-D) to exit. \"\\help\" for help.\nmydb/main> create table t (i int);\nEmpty set (0.01 sec)\n\nmydb/main*>  drop table t;\nEmpty set (0.01 sec)\n\nmydb/main>\n```\n\nAs you can see, there are empty lines printed in the pipe case, and \"Empty Set\" returned in the shell case. The changes proposed by James in https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/pull/9291 and ultimately what claude tried to do don't toggle based on if the input is a pipe or interactive, and as a result will always print `Query OK` - which is not only confusing, but breaks my dolt tests which don't expect them to be there\n\nNext Steps:\n - Get `dolt sql` wise to the way it's being operated. This may require looking at the mysql shell code, or something else. One way or another we need to be aware of when printing these things makes sense.\n - Apply the SET change to GMS, and isolate it to fixing tests only in Dolt and Doltgres. Don't modify the shell output at this stage because it breaks a lot of tests and become intractable.\n -  Update the shell, in the way proposed by James, to get the right information out in the right context.\n\nIn some of these changes, we are going to want to toggle behavior with an environment flag such that we won't stop the development train with broken builds. We kind of need better options to optionally enable behaviors while also getting them in the pipeline for testing." ],

IMHO a proper implementation would be holistic (in a sense that it would address **all** defined API limits (not just length) for **all** resources). Even then, this implementation would be \"local\", e.g. not synced with the current AWS API limits. Granted, those API limits would probably not change very often, yet someone would need to keep this intermediate layer in sync.\r\n\r\nMy proposal would be the following:\r\n\r\n- For those who cannot test such things in non-production environments, validate the API limits that you want to validate by adding the respective input/variable validation logic to your config (https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/expressions/custom-conditions)\r\n- Otherwise, use your non-production environment(s) to test/validate this against the SSOCT (single source of **current** truth) - the real AWS API.", "Marking this issue as stale due to inactivity.

Go to circuitverse official website \n2. login into that\n3. after that go to create new assignment while clicking on the top right corner on your name through which you have login \n4. then click on edit assignment \n5. there you will see the ui issue which above is been addressed\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThere should some space between the two placeholder deadline and grading and also it should be properly aligned and under the enable elements restriction there should be having the proper alignment of the checkbox and name along the row and column under the input and output section.\n\n### Screenshots\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2adb450a-c6d9-46b6-a12e-4cfca2c8a237)\n\n### Device Information [optional]\n\n```markdown\n- OS:\n- Browser:\n- version:\n```\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Are you working on this issue?\n\nYes",

A test was designed using the same input sequence, with two inference modes: the first involves a single full forward pass, while the second splits the sequence into multiple segments for sequential forward passes with manual cache transfer. The test checks whether the outputs of the two modes are consistent.\n2. Three models were tested: GSA, GDN, and RWKV7. The results show that GSA and GDN produced inconsistent outputs, whereas RWKV7 passed the test.\n3. In our training mission, all three models showed normal training loss and static validation results. However, the online testing performance of GSA and GDN fell far short of expectations, with results as poor as those of a random policy. By contrast, RWKV7 demonstrated normal online testing results.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce the Bug\n\n```\nimport torch\nimport fla\nfrom fla.models.gated_deltanet.modeling_gated_deltanet import GatedDeltaNetBlock\nfrom fla.models.gated_deltanet.configuration_gated_deltanet import GatedDeltaNetConfig\nfrom fla.models.gsa.modeling_gsa import GSABlock\nfrom fla.models.gsa.configuration_gsa import GSAConfig\nfrom fla.models.utils import Cache\n\nbsz = 1\nhidden_size = 2048\nseq_len = 1024\nseg_len = 128\nlr = 1.0e-3\nuse_cache = True\n\nseg_num = (seq_len - 1) // seg_len + 1\n\nmodel = \"GDN\"\nif model == \"GDN\":\n    config = GatedDeltaNetConfig(\n        attn_mode='chunk',\n        hidden_size=hidden_size,\n        num_heads=8,  \n        head_dim=int(0.75 * hidden_size // 8)\n    )\n    encoder = GatedDeltaNetBlock(\n        config,\n        layer_idx=0\n    ).to('cuda')\nelse:\n    config = GSAConfig(\n        attn_mode='chunk',\n        hidden_size=hidden_size,\n        num_heads=8\n    )\n    encoder = GSABlock(\n        config,\n        layer_idx=0\n    ).to('cuda')\n\ninputs = torch.randn(bsz, seq_len, hidden_size, device='cuda')\n\ny_full, _,  _ = encoder(\n    hidden_states=inputs,\n    past_key_values=None,\n    use_cache=False\n)\n\nb = 0\ncache = None\n\nfor seg_id in range(seg_num):\n    b = seg_id * seg_len\n    e = min(b + seg_len, seq_len)\n\n    segment_input = inputs[:, b:e]\n\n    y_segment, _, cache = encoder(\n        hidden_states=segment_input,\n        past_key_values=cache,\n        use_cache=use_cache,\n    )\n\n    err = torch.sum((y_full[:, b:e] - y_segment)**2)\n    print(f\"Segment {seg_id}: Error = {err.item()}\")\n```\n\nGot the following Output:\nGDN：\nSegment 0: Error = 0.0023405884858220816\nSegment 1: Error = 1012.900634765625\nSegment 2: Error = 1055.44775390625\nSegment 3: Error = 1116.5162353515625\nSegment 4: Error = 1089.9141845703125\nSegment 5: Error = 1107.427734375\nSegment 6: Error = 1104.24560546875\nSegment 7: Error = 1107.385986328125\n\nGSA:\nSegment 0: Error = 1.5609190313625732e-06\nSegment 1: Error = 3535.44677734375\nSegment 2: Error = 3311.689208984375\nSegment 3: Error = 3273.07568359375\nSegment 4: Error = 3326.33642578125\nSegment 5: Error = 3503.629638671875\nSegment 6: Error = 3420.8076171875\nSegment 7: Error = 3332.25048828125\n\nRWKV7:\nSegment 0: Error = 0.0\nSegment 1: Error = 0.0\nSegment 2: Error = 0.0\nSegment 3: Error = 0.0\nSegment 4: Error = 0.0\nSegment 5: Error = 0.0\nSegment 6: Error = 0.0\nSegment 7: Error = 0.0\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nError close to 0.\n\n### Environment Information\n\n1.

Previously, the layout had inconsistent button sizes, lack of proper spacing, and weak visual hierarchy, making the interface less intuitive. These enhancements improve readability, accessibility, and overall user experience.\n\n**Changes Implemented**\n\nHeader Layout: Added a \"Group Name\" label, increased group name size, and aligned the primary mentor section for better structure.\n\nSection Styling: Introduced light gray backgrounds, subtle shadows, and better spacing to visually separate sections.\n\nButton Consistency: Standardized button sizes, improved alignment, and added hover effects.\n\nVisual Hierarchy: Improved typography, spacing, padding, and margins for a more professional look.\n\n**Screenshots**\n\nBefore:\n\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f082aa89-32c7-4bec-8907-a7fde0b66aa3\" />\n\nAfter:\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d40387fe-9941-4f29-9bcb-4e331ede97b4\n\nAdditional Context\n\nThese refinements contribute to a more structured and user-friendly experience, making navigation and interaction more seamless.\n\nAre you working on this issue?\n\n✅ Yes, I have implemented the changes and am submitting them for review.\n",

This regression might have been introduced in PR [#424](https://github.com/your-repo/your-project/pull/424). A possible (but unconfirmed) cause could be related to the handling of emoji suggestions for the last word — further debugging is required to verify this.\n\n#### Workaround\nExecuting the **plural** command with unknown words seems to restore the Enter key's normal behavior. This behavior is demonstrated in the attached video.\n\n#### Expected Behavior\nPressing the **Enter** key should insert a newline and move the cursor to the next line, maintaining standard input behavior.\n\n#### Attachments\n- Video demonstrating the bug and workaround\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/801cbea9-7138-4833-a1f0-dc6ca471b56b\n\n\n### Device type\n\nSamsung SM-921W\n\n### Versions\n\nandroid 15, Current version of main",

The sensor is configured to use a connection (`https_host-has-no-schema`) with the following details:\n\n- **Host**: `dummyjson.com`\n- **Port**: `443`\n- **Schema**: `https`\n\nDuring the initial execution, the sensor correctly uses `HttpHook` to send a GET request to `https://dummyjson.com:443/fake_endpoint`, receives a 404 response, and defers the task as expected.\n\nHowever, when the deferred task resumes via `HttpSensorTrigger`, the trigger internally creates an `HttpAsyncHook` object. This hook retrieves the connection using `self.get_connection(self.http_conn_id)` but appears to lose the `schema` value. As a result, the final request URL becomes `http://dummyjson.com:443/fake_endpoint`, which is incorrect and causes unexpected behavior.\n\nThis discrepancy between `HttpHook` and `HttpAsyncHook` in handling the connection schema seems to stem from how the connection object is retrieved and interpreted asynchronously. The issue may involve `BaseHook.get_connection`, `Connection`, or `TaskSDKConnection` not properly preserving or propagating the `schema` field.\n\nHere’s a log fragment showing the incorrect behavior. The first request `https` but the second request is `http`.\n```log\n[2025-06-27, 01:46:26] INFO - Connection Retrieved 'https_host-has-no-schema': source=\"airflow.hooks.base\"\n[2025-06-27, 01:46:26] DEBUG - Connection Details: 'Connection(conn_id='https_host-has-no-schema', conn_type='http', description=None, host='dummyjson.com', schema='https', login=None, password=None, port=443, extra=None)': source=\"airflow.hooks.base\"\n[2025-06-27, 01:46:26] DEBUG - Sending 'GET' to url: https://dummyjson.com:443/fake_endpoint: source=\"airflow.task.hooks.airflow.providers.http.hooks.http.HttpHook\"\n......\n[2025-06-27, 01:46:31] INFO - Connection Retrieved 'https_host-has-no-schema': source=\"airflow.hooks.base\"\n[2025-06-27, 01:46:31] DEBUG - Connection Details: 'Connection(conn_id='https_host-has-no-schema', conn_type='http', description=None, host='dummyjson.com', schema=None, login=None, password=None, port=443, extra=None)': source=\"airflow.hooks.base\"\n[2025-06-27, 01:46:31] WARNING - [Try 1 of 3] Request to http://dummyjson.com:443/fake_endpoint failed.: source=\"airflow.providers.http.hooks.http.HttpAsyncHook\"\n```\n\n### What you think should happen instead\n\nThe expected behavior is that both HttpHook and HttpAsyncHook should consistently respect the schema field defined in the Airflow connection. In this case, the connection https_host-has-no-schema explicitly sets schema=https, so all HTTP requests — synchronous or asynchronous — should use https:// in the final URL.\n\n### How to reproduce\n\n1. **Create an Airflow connection** named `https_host-has-no-schema` with the following settings:\n   - **Host**: `dummyjson.com`\n   - **Port**: `443`\n   - **Schema**: `https`\n   - Leave login, password, and extra fields empty.\n\n2. **Create a DAG** with the following code:\n\n   ```python\n   from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n   from airflow import DAG\n   from airflow.providers.http.sensors.http import HttpSensor\n   from airflow.providers.http.operators.http import HttpOperator\n\n   with DAG(\n       dag_id=\"dag_reproduce_issue\",\n       description=\"Reproduce\",\n       start_date=datetime.now() - timedelta(days=1),\n       schedule=None,\n       catchup=False,\n       default_args={\n           \"retries\": 0,\n           \"retry_delay\": timedelta(minutes=1),\n       },\n       tags=[\"reproduce_issue\"],\n   ) as dag:\n\n       https_operator = HttpOperator(\n           task_id=\"https_operator\",\n           http_conn_id=\"https_host-has-no-schema\",\n           endpoint=\"products\",\n           method=\"GET\",\n       )\n\n       https_sensor = HttpSensor(\n           task_id=\"https_sensor\",\n           http_conn_id=\"https_host-has-no-schema\",\n           endpoint=\"fake_endpoint\",\n           method=\"GET\",\n           deferrable=True,\n           poke_interval=30,\n           timeout=60,\n       )\n\n       https_operator >> https_sensor\n   ```\n\n3. **Run the DAG**. Observe the following:\n   - `https_operator` sends a request to `https://dummyjson.com:443/products` and succeeds.\n   - `https_sensor` initially sends a request to `https://dummyjson.com:443/fake_endpoint`, receives a 404, and defers.\n   - When resumed by `HttpSensorTrigger`, the request is sent to `http://dummyjson.com:443/fake_endpoint` instead of `https`.\n\n4. **Check the logs** of the triggerer process to confirm the incorrect URL schema.\n\n### Anything else\n\nThis issue occurs **every time** under the following conditions:\n\n- The Airflow connection's **host** field does **not include a URL schema** (i.e., no `http://` or `https://`).\n- The **schema** field in the connection is explicitly set to `https`.\n- The `HttpSensor` is set to `deferrable=True`. I did not test when `deferrable=False`.\n\nUnder these conditions, the `HttpAsyncHook` used by `HttpSensorTrigger` fails to apply the `https` schema and defaults to `http`, resulting in incorrect request URLs.\n\nHowever, if the host is set to `https://dummyjson.com` (i.e., includes the schema directly in the host field), the issue does **not** occur. In that case, both the host and port are correctly loaded and used by `HttpAsyncHook`.\n\nTo better observe this behavior, it is recommended to enable **DEBUG logging level** in Airflow. This will show the full request URL constructed by the hook and confirm whether the schema is being applied correctly.\n\n### Are you willing to submit PR?\n\n- [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n",

I don't think this is documented anywhere. Here are the main steps:\n\n1\\. First compile the dependency module with `mymodule.swift -emit-library -o /path/to/mymodule.dylib -emit-module-path /path/to/swiftmoduledir/`.  \n2. Compile the executable with `swiftc mymainmodule.swift -emit-object -o /path/to/mymainmodule.o -I /path/to/swiftmoduledir/`  \n3. Link with `swiftc /path/to/mymainmodule.o /path/to/mymodule.dylib -emit-executable -o /path/to/myexe`  \n4. Run the executable normally, or optionally with the new runtime `env DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/libswiftCore.dylib /path/to/myexe`.\n\nOn Linux, the file suffixes would be different (do we support dynamic linking on Linux?), and I imagine replacing DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH with LD_LIBRARY_PATH should just work.\n\nYou can also import a module directory (i.e. containing a `module.modulemap`) with `-I`, or directly import a header `-import-objc-header`.\n\nWe should probably document some examples of invoking swiftc in the help page (right now, it has no examples ❗), and this could be the final example (and the most complicated one). the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH bit is for development, so it's not super clear where we should write that down, but it's not necessarily obvious to a contributor that the locally built compiler compiler links in the OS runtime by default and not the locally built one.\n\nOne potential idea is to have simple example in `--help`, which would a subset of a new document under the `docs/` directory. We can link the document from the `--help` page, so someone can follow it in case they want more complicated examples. The DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH \"trick\" can go into the doc without going into the `--help` information. If we create this new doc, we should also link it from `docs/DebuggingTheCompiler.md`.\n\n\n   ",

      "comments" : [ "can i work on this sir?", "Sure!", ">This avoids the overhead of compaction later if the actual monitor being persisted is tiny anyway.\n\nIs this significant if the channel monitor is small anyway?", "If the storage layer is remote and high latency I think it could be? I guess in theory if we're really careful about the lookup logic (and the KVStore is async) we could do the loading in parallel (though its still a few more requests) but we'd still have to wait on compaction (without a background-compaction task running, which would require a generic `spawn` method...). Seems much easier to just check the length and skip some code for the common case :)", "If I understand it correctly, this is special casing for channels at the beginning of their life and when they grow, the node will switch over to persisting updates and compaction anyway?\n\nTo me it isn't quite clear if this is really worth it. If the hit is significant, it is also a problem when the channel has outgrown the 'small' stage anyway?", "> If I understand it correctly, this is special casing for channels at the beginning of their life and when they grow, the node will switch over to persisting updates and compaction anyway?\n\nYes.\n\n> To me it isn't quite clear if this is really worth it. If the hit is significant, it is also a problem when the channel has outgrown the 'small' stage anyway?\n\nIts more a recognition of two very different cases - if you're running an \"edge node\" that is just a wallet making occasional payments, then you're likely to never hit the \"large\" stage, and thus avoiding the compaction overhead is a really nice optimization. If you're a larger node that is forwarding/processing many payments, you're very likely to hit the \"large\" stage and the compaction penalty is worth it to avoid the writes.", "At what size would the \"large\" stage be entered then typically and how many htlcs/channel updates is that? A channel monitor of a few kb, that doesn't sound like all that many updates?", "Yea, dunno, we'd have to figure that out. I imagine most mobile nodes probably make in the 100s to low 1000s of payments in their entire lifetime, probably fewer on a single channel once you consider splicing and the like. 10KiB or whatever should be plenty for 100 or 250 payments.", "> Its more a recognition of two very different cases\n\nIt sounds like if you wanted to make this automatic, the metric you'd really want to evaluate to switch this behavior isn't so much monitor size, as one of these:\n\n  - Frequency of updates to the channel\n  - Latency of updates to the channel (more difficult)\n\nThe monitor size is a decent reflection of the _number_ of updates to the channel[1], but with no perception of time it's impossible to evaluate whether it's being stored by a tenured edge node, or a routing node. I think if you took time into account, perhaps by using the block delta between the funding tx and chain tip to estimate update frequency, you could make a more informed assessment.\n\nHowever, I worry that automating the behavior selection is not really following the \"principle of least astonishment.\" \n\nI would think that routing nodes rarely move to the edge, and edge nodes rarely become routing nodes (more often, a routing node starts small and may appear like an edge). And furthermore, I know what my node is likely to be; especially if I'm a Lightning developer and managing this on behalf of users, such as in a mobile wallet.\n\nFor that matter, varying the behavior _per channel_ seems to make node persistence more difficult to reason about. Different channels could persist different ways on my node, depending on a size threshold. Which means they can change without me doing anything. I would think that if the reason for variation is the use case, then one behavior is correct for all channels stored by the node.\n\nIn that light, I'd just leave this a configurable behavior, which I think it is now.\n\n[1] I recognize that size is being used here to evaluate the storage write size, not the number of updates. But I think that is why the discussion is unclear. Compared to update count/frequency, it's much harder to know the storage configuration of a given node, and what the throughput/latency tradeoff is like.", "I think the intent of the proposed change is to optimize for the edge-node case with remote storage. Even an edge node may make enough payments to get a monitor up to 10s of KiB in size, at which point network-level effects like TCP slowstart may dominate the actual network latency. For a \"power-user\" edge node, we really want to use the `MonitorUpdatingPersister`, but paying the extra RTT cost of cleanup on load for every edge node is not a great tradeoff either.\n\nFor a routing node, it still seems to me like a size-based threshold may be something they want, purely as it (very marginally) reduces IO throughput for under-utilized or new channels. Writing out updates (padded to 4KiB or more depending on the storage medium) and then consolidating when the whole monitor is only a few KiB isn't really the right tradeoff no matter what. Of course a routing node is expected to surpass the threshold very quickly, so it shouldn't really make a substantial difference, but it seems strictly better to write out full updates in this case than not.\n\nIndeed, this does lead to a bit of behavior shift, but I think the important metrics wouldn't change - first of all, if you happened to look at storage right after compaction, the stored contents would be identical to a full monitor persistence so I wouldn't really say that this materially changes the way that logic would interact with the stored data (you already have to handle the case of having no in-flight updates!). It also shouldn't materially change the IO throughput or write count for any node, just a fairly marginal strict reduction for routing nodes with fresh channels.", "> At what size would the \"large\" stage be entered then typically and how many htlcs/channel updates is that? A channel monitor of a few kb, that doesn't sound like all that many updates?\n\nFor our probing node running ldk-node with network storage (EFS), at around 20,000 updates over the single channel the average probe duration starts to increase substantially. p75 starts to creep up after about 3,000.", "Do y'all have any further thoughts here, @domZippilli or @amackillop?" ],

Do we want to group safety with intersections or with transportation? Arguably the intersections are a type of safety callout, but perhaps the point of separating the intersection callout toggle is to allow everything except intersections to continue being called out.", "That's a great point :-) Perhaps we split out all 3 separately? All the other Callout options are quite binary whereas this one currently incorporates 3 different types...so splitting them out will allow a person to fine-tune the information they wish to hear. It will increase the panel and require more scrolling for the page...but I think it's worth doing. ", "\nI could also argue that the safety spots callout should remain on unless the user decides to turn all callouts off. In the early days of Microsoft Soundscape, there used to be a toggle switch for the Location Updates callout, but starting around the early 2020's,the Location Updates callout became permanently turned on and cannot directly be configured by the user. My argument to leave safety spots on is so that the user is always aware of anything hazardous while walking around. That way the \"Manage Callouts\" menu wouldn't be cluttered with too many configurations. If we decide to go ahead with my solution, I also wrote a revision to the help documentation explaining \"Note: some callouts essential for safe navigation do not have their own toggle switch and can only be disabled with the \"Allow Callouts\" button.\" Anyway, having all three callouts in this section or just Transportation and Intersections will be an improvement, even for sighted users. The term Mobility isn't as intuitive for the average user.", "I can look into this " ],

This way BigQuery can be used as a source of truth for these values.\r\n\r\nOther database drivers could then follow a similar model, for example Postgres has comment fields which can be expected to have the same structured JSON message if the driver is switched to propagate Data Model annotations from the source system table metadata.\r\n\r\nIs this a good proposal?

These are already auto-generated by Cobra, leading to redundancy in the help output and potential discrepancies in the future.\n\nThese changes were merged recently in this [commit](https://github.com/kubearmor/kubearmor-client/commit/ec130453cee6fbdc7296b992d98171f93a47487c)\n\nExample:\n```\n$ ./karmor vm policy\nManage standalone (VM or bare‑metal) KubeArmor security policies.\n\nThe \"policy\" command lets you add, delete, and later list or update enforcement rules \nwhen running KubeArmor outside a Kubernetes cluster. Policies are defined in YAML and \nsent over gRPC to the local KubeArmor agent.\n\nSubcommands:                                                                                 <- content of long description\n  • add     Apply a new policy from a YAML file (kubearmor vm policy add <file>)\n  • delete  Remove an existing policy by its YAML file (kubearmor vm policy delete <file>)\n\nGlobal Flags:                                                                                 <- content of long description\n  • --gRPC <address>   Address of the KubeArmor gRPC server (host:port)\n\nExamples:\n  # Apply a file‑access policy on a standalone host:\n  karmor vm policy add ./file-access.yaml --gRPC 127.0.0.1:50051\n\n  # Remove that policy when finished:\n  karmor vm policy delete ./file-access.yaml --gRPC 127.0.0.1:50051\n\nSee each subcommand's help for more details:\n  karmor vm policy add --help\n  karmor vm policy delete --help\n\nUsage:\n  karmor vm policy [command]\n\nAvailable Commands:                                                                            <- generated by Cobra\n  add         add policy for non kubernetes/bare metal KubeArmor\n  delete      delete policy for non kubernetes/bare metal KubeArmor\n  get         get policy for bare-metal vm/kvms control plane vm\n\nFlags:                                                                                         <- generated by Cobra\n      --gRPC string   gRPC server information\n  -h, --help          help for policy\n\nGlobal Flags:                                                                                  <- generated by Cobra\n      --context string      Name of the kubeconfig context to use\n      --kubeconfig string   Path to the kubeconfig file to use\n\nUse \"karmor vm policy [command] --help\" for more information about a command.\n```\nManually added Long description currently contains:\n\n- Description of command\n- Subcommands: add, delete, etc.\n- Global Flags: --gRPC, etc.\n- Example Usage\n\nThese are also automatically rendered by Cobra, making their inclusion in Long unnecessary. We only need Description and Example Usage\n\n## Proposed Change:\nRefactor the Long descriptions for CLI commands to contain only:\n\n- Command overview\n- Example for usage\n\nRemove manually added subcommands and global flags from the long description.\n\nThis will ensure the CLI help remains clean, DRY, and easier to maintain.\n\nThanks!",

The X axis only shows periods present in the query result, so if the last month is missing from your chart, it's probably not included in the query output. This can happen if the time range end boundary is exclusive or if the SQL time grain logic doesn't generate a row for the last month.\n\nThere have been recent fixes that may help: one ensures all x-axis date labels for the selected time grain are displayed ([PR 33191](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/33191)), and another adds an option to show all X axis ticks on timeseries charts ([PR 33729](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/33729)). Make sure your deployment includes these changes and try enabling the new X axis tick display option if it's available.\n\nIf the issue persists, check the SQL generated for your chart to confirm the last month is included in the result set. Adjusting the time range or time grain settings may help. If you need the last month to appear even when there is no data, you would need to pad missing periods in your dataset or adjust the backend query to generate all expected periods, as the frontend does not do this automatically.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

If your time range is exclusive at the end, try making it inclusive. If you want the last month to appear even when there is no data, you’ll need to pad missing periods in the backend query (e.g., generate a series of all expected months and left join your data onto it). There isn’t a built-in frontend option to do this automatically.\n\nIf you want to explore a frontend solution, you’d need to modify the logic in `extractSeries` to inject missing periods, but this is usually best handled on the backend for consistency across all visualizations.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

I will give it all some more consideration as I get more comfortable with the codebase. For now, I'd like to try updating the mirror button. Is there a specific ticket?", "Aand two more types of tasks:\r\n- <b> just `repo managment:`</b> reviewing [PRs](https://github.com/code-charity/youtube/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc).  And if you want you can join us to set https://github.com/code-charity/youtube/labels, closing issues, etc. \r\n- <b> `managing (old & new) code:`</b> [example](https://github.com/code-charity/youtube/pull/2157)", "hi! @xiomaraR,  thanks and glad if it wasn't too much to read. Let's make this list of types of tasks a [wiki page](https://github.com/code-charity/youtube/wiki) here?\r\nWe don't have a mirror button yet. (closed #80. Once added, we can checkbox it above.)  \r\n - You could start with a [copy of the rotate button](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Acode-charity%2Fyoutube+rotate_button&type=code), adjusting the names & CSS-injection. \r\n   - The function in player.js is the main thing; in our menu Mirror can be listed below Rotate (and you don't have to add it to all the language files, but only to /en/messages.json;  while the first search result (\"core.js\") is only for this: \"// REACTION OR VISUAL FEEDBACK WHEN THE USER CHANGES A SETTING (already automated for our CSS features)\" ) as written above it</i>)\r\n   - So while wanted & minimal, it is ultimately a task AI should do. And for you personally it might only serve to get familiar with webExtensions & this repo (i saw you have a github history\uD83D\uDC4D).  And mirror isn't immediately a unique feature (existing solution with 30 000 users, forgot to link it at first).  So, while i initially though of suggesting Mirror as a beginner-friendly example, it ended up as an example for this type of task instead ( `Assessing / Re-evaluating plans`) <br> and i added this sub-task: (<a href=\"https://github.com/code-charity/youtube/issues/1445#:~:text=remember%20per%20video%20or%20per%20loop%2C%20if%20a%20loop%20is%20set.%20Compare%3A%20mirrortube\"> above </a>)\r\n      - > - [ ] remember per video or per selection, if a loop is or will be set too for this video.  (compare:  [mirrortube](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/mirrortube/pdebhiihcebhmcpmdncgfodomdnhbehj) )\r\n         -   <i> Once we will have that too, it will be a unique product, improvement to all users.  \r\n             -  aand this makes me remember to add:   \" - [ ] transpose.  Compare: [transpose pitch speed loop](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/transpose-%E2%96%B2%E2%96%BC-pitch-%E2%96%B9-spee/ioimlbgefgadofblnajllknopjboejda) (700 000 users)  (Once we add all three things, that would apparently make this extension the best youtube extension for musicians already.) </i>\r\n       - So that will be amazing but take 2 or more tasks, which is why it wasn't among the first 3 examples i mentioned:\r\n         AFAIK `pause while typing` will be unique.  And `moving Subtitles/Captions` below the player will be unique too. (remembered these through checking the labels: #unique, #set&forget, #plan-ready)\r\n         - and we can search more specifically:  [is:open `milestone:\"Little or easy(?)\"` `label:\"\uD83E\uDDE9Plan ready\"` -`label:\"Rare use-case?\"`](https://github.com/code-charity/youtube/issues?q=is%3Aopen+milestone%3A%22Little+or+easy%28%3F%29%22+label%3A%22%F0%9F%A7%A9Plan+ready%22+-label%3A%22Rare+use-case%3F%22+)  \r\n           - so (surprise!) we find the frequent wish of [a shortcut for the rotate button](https://github.com/code-charity/youtube/issues/1699#issuecomment-1751485020)!, part of which you can copy paste in our [shortcuts.js](https://github.com/code-charity/youtube/blob/master/js%26css/web-accessible/www.youtube.com/shortcuts.js?rgh-link-date=2023-10-06T23%3A02%3A12Z).     \r\n         - More over the following player button will be a novelty, since YouTube didn't always provide the headmap:\r\n              - > - [ ] Skip to next key scene data-source: https://github.com/code-charity/youtube/issues/1463 \r\n           -  So this 3rd example, seemed best to suggest,  since this one could (optionally) directly inspire various `Development / engineering`-thoughts. And i and we can join the work /your PRs \r\n              - While working with the JSON will require some more lines of code, but it is typical work. (Q&A/stackoverlow & AI/ chatgpt will help at need);  (and it doesn't help to know this repo yet since we are lacking a data framework. https://github.com/code-charity/youtube/blob/9266d8dfe76eaec30936b4efffcfe931c3c60337/js%26css/web-accessible/www.youtube.com/player.js#L137 ) \r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n" ],

Then if I understand this correctly, when de-serializing the persisted state, every `ChannelMonitorUpdateStep` for a `ChannelMonitor` is replayed so that we build up to the state we had before the last shutdown. Then, the solution you propose would be to\r\n- Add a new property `allow_automated_broadcast` to `ChannelMonitorImpl` that defaults to `true`\r\n- On `update_monitor`, when matching `ChannelForceClosed` with `should_broadcast: false` set the flag to `false`\r\n- On `broadcast_latest_holder_commitment_txn` check for the flag and if it's `false` then... `log_info!` and do nothing?\r\n\r\nSome questions I have:\r\n- It feels odd to have a method called `braodcast...` that won't _always_ broadcast. Should we either:\r\n  - Rename the method to `maybe_broadcast_latest_holder_commitment_txn`, so that it's explicit that under certain conditions it will not broadcast?\r\n  - Define a new method `maybe_broadcast...` that wraps up the current one but checks the flag first and use this new method in this specific use case?\r\n  \r\n  I'm also asking because the method is also called  when the de-serialized `ChannelManager` is stale compared to the `ChannelMonitor`, though in this case there is a channel in the  founding transactions set ([lines 6789-6804](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/blob/79e2af949700281b7333f202a7292e3bf81dc674/lightning/src/ln/channelmanager.rs#L6789-L6805)). I assume in that case too we want the flag to stop us, but I want to make sure I'm not changing some important semantics.\r\n- Is there any other `ChannelMonitorUpdateStep` that would imply that it's safe again to broadcast? Looking at the docs for the Enum I would guess no, but asking just in case.", "Heh, 1564 didn't resolve this, it just referenced it...", "Yes, your understanding is correct, as for your questions:\r\n\r\n> It feels odd to have a method called braodcast... that won't always broadcast. Should we either:\r\n\r\nProbably the second, its still important that users be able to broadcast the latest state if they want to, so we at least need an option to broadcast the state, though it also wouldn't be unreasonable to split it into two methods - `maybe_` and `force_..._unsafe` to indicate that the first will only work if we think its okay to do so, and the second will force it to happen even if its unsafe to do so.\r\n\r\n> I'm also asking because the method is also called when the de-serialized ChannelManager is stale compared to the ChannelMonitor, though in this case there is a channel in the founding transactions set ([lines 6789-6804](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/blob/79e2af949700281b7333f202a7292e3bf81dc674/lightning/src/ln/channelmanager.rs#L6789-L6805)). I assume in that case too we want the flag to stop us, but I want to make sure I'm not changing some important semantics.\r\n\r\nI think in that case, yes, the flag should stop us (though of course generally the flag is not set).\r\n\r\n> Is there any other ChannelMonitorUpdateStep that would imply that it's safe again to broadcast? Looking at the docs for the Enum I would guess no, but asking just in case.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo, once its unsafe its unsafe. Unsafe here means we've lost some data, there's no way to recover that data.", "Great. I'll get to work into the PR then. Thanks!", "I'm having a hard time trying to test the code. I'll keep working on it but I'm posting my progress here in case anyone wants to throw help/comments/ideas. My idea would be to cover this new behavior with a simple unit test that:\r\n- Builds a `ChannelMonitor`\r\n- Sends it a `ForceClosed{should_broadcast: false}`\r\n- Writes and reads it again\r\n- And then tries to call the new methods and asserts whether the transaction was broadcasted.\r\n\r\nMy plan was to copy and adapt some other other unit test for `broadcast_latest_holder_commitment_txn` but couldn't find any. If I understand correctly, you write unit tests for this at the end of the module and integration tests in separate modules, mostly in `funcional_tests.rs`. I also found:\r\n- A `TestPersister` that I think implement Write And Read in-memory.\r\n- A `TestBroadcaster` that can probably help me with the assertions\r\n- A `check_closed_broadcast!` which I believe won't be useful here cause it's checking whether we broadcasted the channel closed message as a gossip update for network peers. Though I'm not really sure I understood correctly.\r\n- On your last PR Matt, you added `do_test_data_loss_protect` which seems to be a more general case integration test. Maybe I should just (or also) extend that one?", "I left a small pointer on your PR and let's continue there but in general its probably simplest and most-coverage to add a new functional test based on an existing one.", "2025-01-30T10:33:55.371Z hydra_bitcoin::node::logger:22: A ChannelManager is stale compared to the current ChannelMonitor!\nimports.wbg.__wbg_error_80de38b3f7cc3c3c @ hydra_node.js:9025\nhydra_node.js:9025 ERROR 2025-01-30T10:33:55.372Z hydra_bitcoin::node::logger:22:  The channel will be force-closed and the latest commitment transaction from the ChannelMonitor broadcast.\nimports.wbg.__wbg_error_80de38b3f7cc3c3c @ hydra_node.js:9025\nhydra_node.js:9025 ERROR 2025-01-30T10:33:55.372Z hydra_bitcoin::node::logger:22:  The ChannelMonitor for channel b37b4660dec0340c000ab33a9c877d671a7e4fe3f7f9945cd9704668e760430f is at update_id 27 but the ChannelManager is at update_id 26.\nimports.wbg.__wbg_error_80de38b3f7cc3c3c @ hydra_node.js:9025\nhydra_node.js:9025 ERROR 2025-01-30T10:33:55.372Z hydra_bitcoin::node::logger:22:  The ChannelMonitor for channel b37b4660dec0340c000ab33a9c877d671a7e4fe3f7f9945cd9704668e760430f is at holder commitment number 281474976710644 but the ChannelManager is at holder commitment number 281474976710645.\nimports.wbg.__wbg_error_80de38b3f7cc3c3c @ hydra_node.js:9025\nhydra_node.js:9025 ERROR 2025-01-30T10:33:55.372Z hydra_bitcoin::node::logger:22: A ChannelManager is stale compared to the current ChannelMonitor!\nimports.wbg.__wbg_error_80de38b3f7cc3c3c @ hydra_node.js:9025\nhydra_node.js:9025 ERROR 2025-01-30T10:33:55.372Z hydra_bitcoin::node::logger:22:  The channel will be force-closed and the latest commitment transaction from the ChannelMonitor broadcast.\nimports.wbg.__wbg_error_80de38b3f7cc3c3c @ hydra_node.js:9025\nhydra_node.js:9025 ERROR 2025-01-30T10:33:55.372Z hydra_bitcoin::node::logger:22:  The ChannelMonitor for channel d91933328927a0fcd20613150cbb852bf8d9d5873b716ab44ce50d504975b8a4 is at update_id 15 but the ChannelManager is at update_id 13.\nimports.wbg.__wbg_error_80de38b3f7cc3c3c @ hydra_node.js:9025\nhydra_node.js:9025 ERROR 2025-01-30T10:33:55.372Z hydra_bitcoin::node::logger:22:  The ChannelMonitor for channel d91933328927a0fcd20613150cbb852bf8d9d5873b716ab44ce50d504975b8a4 is at holder commitment number 281474976710649 but the ChannelManager is at holder commitment number 281474976710650.\nimports.wbg.__wbg_error_80de38b3f7cc3c3c @ hydra_node.js:9025\nhydra_node.js:9025 ERROR 2025-01-30T10:33:55.372Z hydra_bitcoin::node::logger:22:  The ChannelMonitor for channel d91933328927a0fcd20613150cbb852bf8d9d5873b716ab44ce50d504975b8a4 is at revoked counterparty transaction number 281474976710650 but the ChannelManager is at revoked counterparty transaction number 281474976710651.\nimports.wbg.__wbg_error_80de38b3f7cc3c3c @ hydra_node.js:9025\n\nis this related?", "@philipp1992 not quite.

My DAG configs were: retries=1000, retry_delay=5 min (300 seconds), max_retry_delay=1h (3600 seconds). My DAG failed ~1000 times and after that Scheduler broke down. After that retries exceeded 1000 and stopped on 1017 retry attempt. \n\nI did my research on this problem and found that this happened due to formula **min_backoff = math.ceil(delay.total_seconds() * (2 ** (self.try_number - 1)))** in **taskinstance.py** file. So retry_exponential_backoff has no limit of try_number and during calculations it can overflow max Float value. So even if max_retry_delay is set formula is still calculating.

Since ProbeRunner already stores this reference internally, this integration would be straightforward.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> We should prioritize implementing **initialize** first, as it's the more critical of the two. The finalize callback can be addressed in a follow-up PR.\n\n## Example\n\nHere’s a snippet of code that would be moved into the initialize callback of the `isWeakCrypto` probe:\n\n```js\nthis.tracer = new VariableTracer()\n  .enableDefaultTracing()\n  // ↓↓↓ this part\n  .trace(\"crypto.createHash\", {\n    followConsecutiveAssignment: true, moduleName: \"crypto\"\n  });\n```\n\nWe don't need to trace `crypto.createHash` if the isWeakCrypto probe is not used.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e7dca6f-1881-423b-9fb1-ab8c55736a7a)",

      "description" : "# GPU Support for the Ersilia Model Hub\n\n## Background\n\nCurrently, the Ersilia Model Hub does not support GPU acceleration, which limits the performance of some models — and makes others completely unusable. Models are currently packaged as CPU-only Docker images. The goal of this project is to evaluate and implement GPU support using Docker.\n\n## Goals\n\n- Demonstrate that a model can run inside a Docker container with GPU access.\n- Build the foundation to support GPU in the Ersilia infrastructure (template, CLI, metadata, CI/CD).\n- Benchmark performance between CPU and GPU runs.\n\n## Step 1: Manual GPU Docker Test (Top-Down)\n\nWe will first verify that models can run in a GPU-enabled Docker container, without relying on Ersilia's internal infrastructure (e.g., CLI or model template).\n\n- [ ] Select two test models:\n  - [ ] One **GPU-only** model (TBD).\n  - [ ] One **GPU/CPU-compatible** model (suggested: FAISS-based).\n- [ ] Set up the new GPU workstation.\n- [ ] Choose and test an appropriate CUDA base image (e.g., `nvidia/cuda:...`).\n- [ ] Ensure image size is acceptable (<~4GB ideally).\n- [ ] Run tests on:\n  - [ ] At least two local GPU workstations.\n  - [ ] One cloud instance (e.g., AWS GPU instance).\n\n## Step 2: Integrate GPU Support into Ersilia Infrastructure\n\n### \uD83E\uDDF1 At the [Ersilia Template](https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos-template) level\n\n- [ ] How should `install.yml` indicate GPU requirements?\n- [ ] If model code differs between CPU/GPU, how should this be reflected in the `framework/`?\n\n### ⚙️ At the [Ersilia CLI](https://github.com/ersilia-os/ersilia) level\n\n- [ ] Add support for `--gpu` or `--cpu` flags in the `ersilia serve` command.\n- [ ] Decide whether GPU/CPU mode should be:\n  - Explicit (user-defined via flag), or\n  - Automatic (detect from hardware?)\n- [ ] Assess: Can one image support both CPU and GPU, or do we need separate ones?\n\n### \uD83D\uDCE6 At the [Ersilia Metadata](https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos5axz/blob/main/metadata.json) level\n\n- [ ] Add `runtime: GPU` / `CPU` or similar field.\n- [ ] Consider `requirements` or `compatibility` sections if needed.\n\n### \uD83D\uDC33 On [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/ersiliaos)\n\n- [ ] Should GPU-compatible images use a separate tag (e.g., `model:gpu`) or separate repo?\n- [ ] Define tagging convention early.\n\n## Step 3: GitHub Actions & CI Integration\n\nIn the [Ersilia Model Workflows](https://github.com/ersilia-os/ersilia-model-workflows):\n\n- [ ] Detect whether a model supports GPU.\n- [ ] Build and push a GPU-compatible Docker image (using `nvidia-docker`).\n- [ ] Ensure existing workflows are not broken.\n\nIn the [Ersilia CLI CI/CD](https://github.com/ersilia-os/ersilia):\n\n- [ ] Add at least one unit test to check GPU execution (on GitHub-hosted runners or self-hosted runner with GPU).\n\n## Step 4: Benchmarking & Validation\n\n- [ ] Run performance benchmarks:\n  - CPU vs GPU execution time.\n  - Memory consumption and constraints.\n- [ ] Record any limitations or environment-specific requirements.",

For example : \n\n```nvidia/cuda:12.9.0-runtime-ubuntu24.04```\n\nThis comes to ~ 2 GB/3 GB depending on the exact CUDA and Ubuntu Version being used. \n\nIdeally run automated tests/builds for different combinations of Ubuntu (or other distributions?) and CUDA  versions. \n\n## CPU vs GPU preliminary testing\n\nA very simple test on TabPFN using a [Sci-Kit Learn Breast Cancer Dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html) showed approximately 3x-4x speed ups when GPU access to the process was enabled, compared to CPU only runs (on the Norrsken GPU Workstation).\n\nMore detailed tests using a [Dataset of approximately 2 Million Compounds](https://github.com/ersilia-os/sars-cov-2-chemspace/blob/main/data/reference_library_inchikeys.csv) showed overwhelming speed-ups with GPU Accelerated similarity searches using [FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss), the difference between search times of GPU and CPU implementations scaled/diverged with the Index size. **It is clearly worth trying to accelerate models using GPU Acceleration.**\n\nWe built indices out of Count Fingerprints of the compounds (converted the SMILES to 2048 Vectors). Cosine Similarity was used as a metric. \n\nFAISS does not support cosine by default, so we use  an `Inner Product` index and perform L2 (Euclidean) Normalisation on the vectors before adding to them to the index (or before searching), which is the equivalent of using Cosine similarity.\n\nTests were ran with index sizes of `10,000`, `100,000`, `500,000` and `1,000,000`. Nearest 100 Neighbours. \n\n### Index size 100,000:\n| Number of Searches | CPU (s) | GPU (s) |\n|--------------------|---------|---------|\n| 100                | 1       | 0.01    |\n| 1,000              | 7.08    | 0.04    |\n| 10,000             | 67.49   | 0.11    |\n| 100,000            | >350    | 1.30    |\n| 500,000            | -       | 5.50    |\n\n### Index size 1,000,000\n\n| Number of Searches | CPU (s) | GPU (s) |\n|--------------------|---------|---------|\n| 100                | 9.42    | 0.02    |\n| 1,000              | 71      | 0.10    |\n| 10,000             | 711     | 1.03    |\n| 100,000            | -       | 10.45   |\n| 500,000            | -       | 52.50   |\n\n\n\n### \n\n<img width=\"765\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e39adae0-7c06-43ba-ba5f-3da89037da02\" />\n\n_NOTE: GPUs are typically higher latency but have higher parallel throughput and memory bandwidth than CPUs. It is best to use batch queries with the CPU or GPU as this amortises the touching of index memory across all of the queries and this is when GPU speed ups are convenient. We will most likely not see any improvements in GPU search times with single queries (if anything it might be slower because of GPU overhead)._\n\n\nThe examples of inference time comparisons and a 3D plot (inference time against index and query sizes), clearly demonstrate **GPUs provide absolutely non-trivial speed ups for the right tasks.**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "# Very Heavy Index (FAISS Flat)\n\nFlat (IP and L2 for example) indices are extremely large (because FAISS only supports Float32 vectors, hence each Fingerprint vector is 32 * 2048 = 65,536 Bits or 4 * 2048=8,192  Bytes), scaling up to millions of vectors means we are dealing with indices that are 10s of GBs.\n\nTried FPSim2 but there are no benefits to GPU accelerating since it does not support batch queries (could be worth looking into CUDA Programming and tuning it to support batch queries, as it supports Sparse Vectors and Tanimoto Search on GPU)\n\n## Promising alternative to Flat FAISS Index: **Approximate Nearest Neighbour (ANN) search**\n\nMost methods for ANN require index training and parameter tuning which makes building the index more complex. We also need to ensure that the training sample is diverse. \n\nPlease note the difference between training and adding to Indices. And index cannot be trained incrementally but can be incrementally added to.\n\nMemory bottlenecks are also an issue so I first train the index and then add vectors to it incrementally in batches. (Although, it is suggested, If possible at all,  add more compute at index build time. (Especially if the index does not change a lot over time))\n\nThe following ANN methods are explored and suggested (compared to ~16 GB with a flat index of around 1.99 million Vectors)\n\n### **_IVFPQ (Inverted File Index with Product Quantisation):_** \n\n#### **_I am yet to do Accuracy tests on IVFPQ but with computational performance (inference time), models seem to enjoy GPU Acceleration speed ups similar to those mentioned above for FAISS Flat indices._**\n\nThis creates very light indices: `~93 MB for an index of around 1.99 Million Vectors`, but there might be a non-trivial loss of accuracy. \n\nNote: For some reason after the index is trained and incrementally built, FAISS takes a lot of time to write it to disk which makes it look like the process is frozen but isn't actually frozen - it goes into an \"uninterruptible sleep\" because of Disk IO, as indicated by the \"D\" state in htop. \n\n### **_HNSWSQ (Hierarchical Navigable Small World Index with Scalar Quantisation)_**\n\nTraining is reasonably fast (with GPU) but adding vectors is computationally intensive and needs to batched appropriately.\n\n#### **_I am yet to do Accuracy tests on HNSWSQ but with computational performance , HNSW seem to enjoy GPU Acceleration only with at Training time as indices are pretty compact and are VERY FAST with CPU and FAISS does not have a GPU search for this yet._**\n\nWhen choosing the strength of quantisation, there is a trade off between memory and accuracy:\n\nIndex of **1.99 million Vectors**:\n\n```\n4.63 GB (~2KB Per Vector + overhead) with a  8-Bit Quantiser while maintaining around 95-98% Accuracy^\n\n\n\n2.59 GB (~1.15KB Per Vector + overhead) with a 4-Bit Quantiser  while maintaining around 90-95% Accuracy^\n```\n\n\nAdding vectors to this kind of index is slow.\n\n_^accuracy according to official documentation and third party tests_\n", "# Metric Learning - Embedding Model\n\nAnother alternative to using vanilla flat indices with 2048 dimensional fingerprints we explore is the use of a metric learning model to create embeddings that are lower dimensions. We use these embeddings to create flat FAISS indices that are much lighter than the standard fingerprint indices (512, 256, 128, 100 dimensional embeddings vs 2048 dimensional fingerprints). We uses torch's GPU version and enjoy non-trivial speed-ups at training time, while creating embeddings and inference time (FAISS Search using a GPU index).\n\nNote: The searches are performed on a flat index, hence are exact searches, but the using of the embedding model means there is an approximation.", "We are aiming to create compound similarity search models with 4 compound libraries:\n\n- ChemDiv (100k)\n- A representative of Enamine  (~9 million)\n- DrugBank (~11k)\n- COCONUT (should be between 500k and 1 Million)\n\nWe also create a _Metric Learning Embedding Model_ out of a [reference library of 2 million compounds.](https://github.com/ersilia-os/sars-cov-2-chemspace/blob/main/data/reference_library_inchikeys.csv).\n\nFor each of the above libraries the aim is to have 3 variants of indices:\n\n- _A flat IP index with L2 Normalisation_\n    - This is going to be very large for libraries with 500k+ compounds)\n\n- _A compressed IVFPQ IP index  with L2 normalisation (FAISS compression)_\n   - This creates very light indices but as mentioned above there is a loss of search accuracy\n\n- _A flat index created with embeddings from the above mentioned model._\n   - This is lets us create indices that are lighter than vanilla flat indices and also lets us have control and confidence over the accuracy of the search (given that we are confident in the embedding model, which is arguably simpler to benchmark).\n \n", "Implemented a metric learning pipeline that creates learned embeddings from existing flat FAISS index. \n\n### Transforms 2048-dimensional fingerprints → _256/128/100-dimensional learned embeddings_ with cosine similarity\n\n### Triplet sampling: Uses existing 2M compound FAISS index for mining hard positives/negatives\n\nEvaluations: ROC-AUC, AP, distance distributions, t-SNE visualizations\n\nThe pipeline maintains L2 normalization throughout for FlatIP cosine similarity and includes model checkpointing + SMILES mapping for deployment.\n\nCreated with PyTorch + FAISS GPU.

      "repositoryName" : "aquasecurity/trivy",
      "description" : "## Description\n\nThis is a feature request to add SHA-512 hash algorithm support to Trivy's SBOM parsing capabilities. Currently, Trivy only supports SHA-1, SHA-256, and MD5 hash algorithms when processing SBOM files.\n\nSome tools, particularly NPM's SBOM generation (`npm sbom`), use SHA-512 hashes for package integrity verification. Adding SHA-512 support would enable Trivy to fully process these SBOMs and preserve important security metadata.\n\n### Current limitations:\n- **CycloneDX**: SHA-512 hashes are ignored and the hashes field becomes `null`\n- **SPDX**: SHA-512 checksums are completely omitted from the output\n\n\n## Current Behavior\n\n### CycloneDX\nIn `pkg/sbom/cyclonedx/unmarshal.go:251-268`, the `unmarshalHashes` function only supports:\n- SHA1\n- SHA256\n- MD5\n\nAny other algorithm (including SHA-512) logs a warning but still creates a digest with an empty algorithm prefix (e.g., `:hashvalue` instead of `sha512:hashvalue`), resulting in malformed digest strings.\n\n### SPDX\nIn `pkg/sbom/spdx/marshal.go:501-522`, the `spdxChecksums` function has the same limitation, returning `nil` for unsupported algorithms.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe limitation stems from `pkg/digest/digest.go` which only defines three algorithms:\n```go\nconst (\n    SHA1   Algorithm = \"sha1\"\n    SHA256 Algorithm = \"sha256\"\n    MD5    Algorithm = \"md5\"\n)\n```\n\n## Desired Behavior\n\nTrivy should support SHA-512 hash algorithm alongside the existing SHA-1, SHA-256, and MD5 support. This would enable Trivy to:\n- Preserve SHA-512 hashes when processing SBOMs from NPM and other tools\n- Generate SBOMs with SHA-512 hashes when appropriate\n- Maintain full compatibility with CycloneDX and SPDX specifications\n\n\n## Impact\n\n- Loss of package integrity verification data\n- Generated SBOMs may be invalid or incomplete\n- Affects tools that rely on SHA-512 for security validation\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n1. Add SHA512 constant to `pkg/digest/digest.go`:\n   ```go\n   const (\n       SHA1   Algorithm = \"sha1\"\n       SHA256 Algorithm = \"sha256\"\n       SHA512 Algorithm = \"sha512\"\n       MD5    Algorithm = \"md5\"\n   )\n   ```\n\n2. Add SHA-512 calculation support in the digest package\n\n3. Update `unmarshalHashes` in CycloneDX:\n   ```go\n   case cdx.HashAlgoSHA512:\n       alg = digest.SHA512\n   ```\n\n4. Update `spdxChecksums` in SPDX:\n   ```go\n   case digest.SHA512:\n       alg = spdx.SHA512\n   ```\n\n## References\n\n- NPM SBOM documentation: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npm-sbom\n- CycloneDX hash algorithm specification: https://cyclonedx.org/docs/1.6/json/#components_items_hashes\n- SPDX checksum specification: https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/package-information/#79-package-checksum-field\n\n## Test Data\n\n### CycloneDX Example\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"http://cyclonedx.org/schema/bom-1.5.schema.json\",\n  \"bomFormat\": \"CycloneDX\",\n  \"specVersion\": \"1.5\",\n  \"components\": [\n    {\n      \"bom-ref\": \"lodash@4.17.21\",\n      \"type\": \"library\",\n      \"name\": \"lodash\",\n      \"version\": \"4.17.21\",\n      \"hashes\": [\n        {\n          \"alg\": \"SHA-512\",\n          \"content\": \"bf690311ee7b95e713ba568322e3533f2dd1cb880b189e99d4edef13592b81764daec43e2c54c61d5c558dc5cfb35ecb85b65519e74026ff17675b6f8f916f4a\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### SPDX Example\n```json\n{\n  \"spdxVersion\": \"SPDX-2.3\",\n  \"packages\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"lodash\",\n      \"SPDXID\": \"SPDXRef-Package-lodash-4.17.21\",\n      \"checksums\": [\n        {\n          \"algorithm\": \"SHA512\",\n          \"checksumValue\": \"bf690311ee7b95e713ba568322e3533f2dd1cb880b189e99d4edef13592b81764daec43e2c54c61d5c558dc5cfb35ecb85b65519e74026ff17675b6f8f916f4a\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Discussed in https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy/discussions/9082\n",

As this is `401` I _assume_ it actually comes from the OAuth API. If it is the OAuth API then we could indicate unavailability on the backend (SaaS) side with a proper [HTTP error code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status#server_error_responses). \n* If it comes from the open GRPC port, then @npepinpe indicated the ingress/load balancer could detect unavailability and reject a remote connection; it would then lead to an improved UX on our end.\n\nMy ask is that if we take this issue, then we root cause the actual reason for the issue, and work with the respective teams to consider \"simple solutions\".\n\nOur rationale (\"why evolve\") is clear: The interaction of auto-pausing + Desktop Modeler to C8 SaaS deployment leads to a _guaranteed_ bad impression during the trial experience.", "I've tried to reproduce this now with a paused `Camunda 8.7+gen5` cluster. This time, I received an `Error: 14 UNAVAILABLE: Received HTTP status code 502` error. The token was fetched successfully. When I gave invalid credentials, I received a proper  401 error coming from the oAuth endpoint.\n\nThe error describes exactly what is happening (cluster is in fact unavailable), so what we could improve is to mention cluster pausing in [the linked troubleshooting guide](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/modeler/desktop-modeler/troubleshooting/#i-cannot-connect-to-zeebe).\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b2b5600-da1f-4d16-b811-e913fe43a989)", "@barmac This sounds great.

Instead the user could upload to an s3 bucket, and nodes could download from that instead.\n\nThis adds the requirement to always configure s3 buckets even if you won't use them. It adds to the overhead of getting started with the tool and also complicates simple experiments (I never did the s3 setup, so don't know how it looks like)\n\n> Alternatively, if we really wanted to increase speeds, the payload could be uploaded to a single node first, then they would gossip the payload via a simple predefined route, rest rpc, and even verified via a known hash.\n\nThe problem with this is if we want to go this route, we will need to create a fresh ssh key and authorise it in all nodes to be able to send the data. Alternatively, we could tinker with sending the data using `netcat`, but we won't expect much security from that but maybe that's fine.\n\nCurrently, with `xz` compression, the deployment takes ~4min, I think that's fine, no? ", "> This adds the requirement to always configure s3 buckets\n\nif you set them up on your machine once, then every talis init will grab them. Since this work must be redone for tracing an entire network (every engineer needs to do this imo if we want an actual understanding of what is happening), it seems okay. that's what the original reasoning was at least.\n\n> The problem with this is if we want to go this route, we will need to create a fresh ssh key and authorize it in all nodes to be able to send the data\n\nyeah true but adding ssh keys to operators such as digital ocean and linode is already automated w/ talis. Also doesn't inherently need to be fresh each time.\n\n> Currently, with xz compression, the deployment takes ~4min, I think that's fine, no?\n\nits fine if one has a beefy machine and internet connection and only small talis networks yeah. for example, currently a 16GB laptop cannot run talis for a 20 node network. It's also difficult to run in an office which has ~20MB/s upload per device. For 100+ node networks we likely need a solution or just need to ensure its done efficiently. \n" ],

Improper nesting can confuse assistive technology users and impair content discoverability.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. go to a tutorial page (e.g., /tutorials/get-started/).\n2. Locate each heading\n3. Inspect the sequence of heading levels and observe instances where the heading level jumps by more than one (e.g., `<h1>` directly to `<h6>`), indicating improper nesting.\n\nfor example:\n\n#### page 1\n1. Go to /tutorials/setting-up-your-environment/\n2. Locate to the following elements\nPosition 1: h6 element “By Layla Quiñones, Jaleesa Trapp“\n\n#### page 2\n1. Go to /tutorials/get-started/.\n2.  Locate to the following element:\n* Position 1: h4 element \"Default Code\" in Step 1 section\n \n#### page 3\n1. Go to /tutorials/variables-and-change/.\n2.

Go to /tutorials/organizing-code-with-functions/.\n2.  Locate to the following element:\n* Position 1: h6 element \"By Greg Benedis-Grab, Layla Quiñones\"\n* Position 2: h5 element \"Or Try This Spicy Challenge!\" in Conclusion section\n* Position 3: h1 element \"Next Steps\"\n* Position 4: h1 element \"References\"\n\n#### page 5\n1. Go to /data-structure-garden/.\n2.  Locate to the following element:\n* Position 1: h6 element \"By Portia Morrell, Jaleesa Trapp, Kate Maschmeyer\"\n\n#### page 6\n1. Go to /tutorials/animating-with-media-objects/.\n2.

To optimize resource efficiency, CPU-intensive tasks are scheduled on these nodes. However, this leads to ​​GPU task scheduling failures​​ when CPU tasks monopolize excessive CPU/memory resources, starving GPU workloads of necessary compute capacity. Implement a ​​persistent reservation mechanism​​ that:\n1. Permanently reserves a dedicated portion of CPU/memory resources ​​exclusively for GPU tasks​​ on each GPU node.\n2. Exposes granular metrics for each reservation to monitor: Resource allocation status (e.g., allocated CPU cores, memory)\n\n**Is there a suggested solution, if so, please add it**:\n\n  Expose related resource usage through metrics, similar to the elasticquota plugin.",

Ensures both dates are present.\r\n2. Resulting type of `[string, string]` instead of `string[]` prevents certain type errors.\r\n3. Elements could have different types (not relevant in this example).\r\n\r\nJust an example there are obviously many others.</div>",

I’d love to work on this—could you please assign it to me?\"", "Hi,\n\nI am trying to write a custom plugin that adds the last git commit hash to each doc page using the [extendMarkdownPageData](vscode-file://vscode-app/usr/share/code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html) hook. My plugin is loaded (I see my logs), but the [extendMarkdownPageData](vscode-file://vscode-app/usr/share/code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html) function is never called during the build, even though I have many markdown files in my [docs](vscode-file://vscode-app/usr/share/code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html) folder.\n\nHere’s a minimal version of my plugin:\n\n```\n// src/plugins/git-commit-info/index.js\nconst { exec } = require('child_process');\n\nfunction getLastCommitHashAsync(filePath) {\n  return new Promise((resolve) => {\n    exec(`git log -n 1 --pretty=format:%h -- \\\"${filePath}\\\"`, { encoding: 'utf8' }, (err, stdout) => {\n      if (err) return resolve(null);\n      resolve(stdout.trim());\n    });\n  });\n}\n\nconsole.log('[git-commit-info] Plugin loaded');\n\nmodule.exports = function (context, options) {\n  return {\n    name: 'docusaurus-plugin-git-commit-info',\n    async extendMarkdownPageData(mdData) {\n      console.log('[git-commit-info] mdData:', mdData);\n      // ...rest of logic...\n      return mdData;\n    },\n  };\n};\n```\n\nAnd in my docusaurus.config.js I add it like this:\n\n```\nplugins: [\n  require.resolve('./src/plugins/git-commit-info'),\n  // other plugins...\n],\n```\n\nBut the hook is never triggered.\n\nWhat I have tried so far:\n\nI confirmed that my plugin is being loaded by adding [console.log('[git-commit-info] Plugin loaded');] at the top level, and I see this message during the build.\nI added multiple [console.log]  statements inside the [extendMarkdownPageData] function to check if it is ever called and to inspect the [mdData] object.\nI verified that I have many markdown files in my [docs] directory, and they are referenced in my sidebar.\nI tried running the build with different Docusaurus versions.\nI also considered moving the plugin to remarkPlugins, but I understand this is not the correct approach for Docusaurus content plugins.\nDespite these steps, the extendMarkdownPageData function is never called during the build.\n\nMy questions:\nIs [extendMarkdownPageData](vscode-file://vscode-app/usr/share/code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html) only called for plugins loaded as part of the docs content pipeline (e.g., via docs.plugins in [docusaurus.config.js](vscode-file://vscode-app/usr/share/code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html)), and not for plugins in the main plugins array?\nShould I add my plugin to the docs.plugins array instead?\nIs there a recommended way to hook into the docs processing pipeline to add metadata to each doc page?\nIs there anything else I might be missing?\nThank you for your help!\n", "Thank you!

Do you have an example plan that provokes this that we can turn into a unit test for this?", "I tried to make a simplified plan to demonstrate the error, but without success. It appears randomly when I work with many devices controlled in multi-run plans. ", "Would you be able to post the full plan? It might give a clue as to where it fails...", "Well... I don't have a \"plan\" in the standard sense. I am working on software that provides a GUI for \"plan builder\" for running my experiment. \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/498da074-9fd5-45e4-90ca-0caf5061c4b0)\n\nIn general, it can be summarized to the plan like this:\n\n```\ndevices = [motor0, motor1, motor2, detector0,....]\nmonitor = [motor0, motor1, motor2,...]\nunmonitor_before_read = [motor2,motor1]\ndef plan():\n    yield from bps.open_run()\n    yield from bps.trigger_and_read(devices)\n    for motor in monitor:\n        yield from bps.monitor(motor, name=motor.name+\"_monitor\")\n\n    # >>> generated by \"plan builder\"\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            for m in unmonitor_before_read:\n                yield from bps.unmonitor(m)\n            yield from bps.trigger_and_read(devices)\n            for m in unmonitor_before_read:\n                yield from bps.monitor(m,name=m.name+\"_monitor\")\n    # << generated by \"plan builder\"\n    \n    yield from bps.close_run()\n```\nSo I start and interrupt the monitors depending on the inner plans. As I said before, the error appears randomly, so I can't reproduce it in the simplified plan. I do not exclude that \"plan builder\" generates code with errors, as this project is in its early stage.\nA simple copy of the `_listeners` dict solves the problem, so I decided to share it with the community...\n" ],

This issue occurs after enabling the practice tab and can be consistently reproduced.\n\n\n### URL of the page where the issue is observed.\n\nN/A\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Assign yourself the Curriculum Admin role.\n\n2. Generate:\n\n    - A dummy math classroom\n\n    - A dummy topic\n\n    - A dummy skill\n\n3. Add the dummy topic to the math classroom via http://localhost:8181/classroom-admin.\n\n4. In the Topic Editor, add the dummy skill to a subtopic.\n\n5. Check the \"Show practice tab to learners\" option.\n\n6. Go to the topic's page and open the Revision tab.\n\n7. Resize the browser window while on the Revision tab.\n\n8. Observe the formatting of the mat-card in the body.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe layout of the mat-card should adapt responsively and remain well-formatted, similar to how it behaves in the Learn page(http://localhost:8181/learn/math/dummy-topic-one/practice).\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/460c1fa2-e90d-4ab6-be00-4a2093723b55)\n\n### Screenshots/Videos\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d8ceab3-a026-41dc-b9f1-62023627e999)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f8229d5-d387-470c-812e-623ddba5a355)\n\n### What device are you using?\n\nDesktop, Mobile\n\n### Operating System\n\nMacOS\n\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Browser version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Tips for developers\n\nBefore addressing the bug, please identify which PR caused the issue (you can follow the steps [here](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/How-to-find-the-commit-which-introduced-a-bug)). If you identify the PR, comment on the issue with a link to it. If not, mention the commit hash of the oldest commit you saw the bug on (and the month and year it was made in).\n\nThen, please leave a comment with details of the approach that you plan to take to fix the issue (see [example](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/issues/19157#issuecomment-1858788463)).\n\n**Note:** If this is your first Oppia issue, please make sure to follow our guidelines for [choosing an issue](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Contributing-code-to-Oppia#choosing-a-good-first-issue) and [setting things up](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Contributing-code-to-Oppia#setting-things-up). You will also need to show a demo of the fix working correctly on your local machine. Thanks!\n",

      "description" : "### Bug description\n\nWhen configuring dashboard filters with the \"Values are dependent on other filters\" option, the system prevents creating bi-directional dependencies upfront by showing a \"Cyclic dependency detected\" message. However, it allows creating the same dependency indirectly after saving the initial filter configuration.\n\n1. If Filter A is set to depend on Filter B, the system blocks setting Filter B to depend on Filter A immediately, showing a \"Cyclic dependency detected\" message.\n2. However, if Filter A is saved with the dependency on Filter B, the system later allows editing Filter B to create the reverse dependency, effectively forming a bi-directional (cyclic) dependency.\n\nThis behavior is inconsistent and might lead to unexpected filter behavior. It appears to contradict the intended prevention of cyclic dependencies.\nHow to reproduce the bug\n\n1. Create a dashboard filter (e.g., Filter A) with a dependency on another filter (e.g., Filter B) by enabling the Values are dependent on other filters option.\n2. Save the filter configuration.\n3. Open the dashboard filter configuration again, select Filter B, and set it to depend on Filter A.\n4. Save the changes.\n\n## Expected results\n\nThe system should prevent bi-directional (cyclic) dependencies for all filter types, not just date filters. Users should not be able to create a cyclic dependency by editing the filters after saving the initial configuration.\n\n## Actual results\n\nThe platform allows creating cyclic dependencies indirectly after the initial configuration, even though it prevents it upfront. This behavior is inconsistent and may lead to unexpected filter behavior.\n\n### Screenshots/recordings\n\n_No response_\n\n### Superset version\n\nmaster / latest-dev\n\n### Python version\n\n3.11\n\n### Node version\n\n18 or greater\n\n### Browser\n\nChrome\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Checklist\n\n- [x] I have searched Superset docs and Slack and didn't find a solution to my problem.\n- [x] I have searched the GitHub issue tracker and didn't find a similar bug report.\n- [x] I have checked Superset's logs for errors and if I found a relevant Python stacktrace, I included it here as text in the \"additional context\" section.",

Add a function in `lib/runtime` to list them in etcd - see `component.rs` `list_instances` for an example (that one only lists the instances of a Component).\n\n\n### Describe the problem you're encountering\n\n/\n\n### Describe alternatives you've tried\n\n_No response_",

      "description" : "Currently when a user presses enter, the profile page at the top of the results list is what loads. However, consider how Google treats this (screenshot below).\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17221652/118880440-dc58bf00-b8bf-11eb-8d7f-20e752a01733.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17221652/118880777-41141980-b8c0-11eb-8b0c-4b5eca9ee53a.png)\r\n\r\nI am not suggesting that we use auto-complete (though that is certainly an interesting idea) but notice that in this instance if one was to press \"enter\" Google would not bring you to search results for \"gordon college bennett center\" but rather what I typed - \"gordon college.\" This contrasts to our quick Header People Search, which just assumes you meant the top result if you press enter (which is more like the first screenshot).\r\n\r\nWhat if instead, pressing enter takes you to People Search with pre-filled in entries _based on_ the top result. For example, entering \"Cam\" into the Header People Search like this first image would lead to the page in the second image because the top result matched using first name.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17221652/118881598-46be2f00-b8c1-11eb-9822-a53ce80209e6.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17221652/118881657-50e02d80-b8c1-11eb-8db3-8d3efa947181.png)\r\n\r\nHowever, if \"Campo\" is typed, the top result is based on the last name \"Campoli\" so it should lead to the appropriate page.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17221652/118882034-b6341e80-b8c1-11eb-80d4-a861c3e2549c.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17221652/118882191-e8de1700-b8c1-11eb-97a9-c9fafe73e9ae.png)\r\n\r\nFor the use case that a first _and_ last name is entered in some fashion, intuitively both these sections would be filled. So if one enters \"Cam A\" the People Search results for first name \"Cam\" and last name \"A\" should appear.\r\n\r\nAs another use case, perhaps if there is only one result for a given search criterium, we can go straight to that particular profile like we are currently with all search results. That may be debatably less consistent, but a good practical idea to consider.\r\n",

      "comments" : [ "I wonder if it would be beneficial to modify the people search page to have a generic search bar that runs off of similar functionality to the quick people search bar. Then, you could have an \"advanced search\" button that would switch the view to our existing people search page (with all of the more specific fields & filters). This would be more like traditional search pages as it still allows for the basic search with a results page.\r\n\r\nOnce we did that, we would be able to pass a generic query parameter (like \"Cam\" in this case) and it would bring up all of the results that you would have seen in the quick search bar previously. I think that makes the most UX sense, but I welcome input from @EjPlatzer @ChrisImagineer .", "I'm not sure I see the use case for having the People Search page duplicate the functionality of the quick search bar. Given that the quick search bar is visible from every page (as long as you're authenticated), no one would ever need to use the People Search page for the \"non-advanced\" search features - they can simply use the search bar.\r\n\r\nGiven that, it seems like the only reason to have the simple search is to make it easier for us as developers to pass search values from the search bar to the people search page. Assuming that's something we want to do (which I'm not convinced it is), we shouldn't default to this implementation just because it's the easiest.\r\n\r\nConsider, for example, why someone would want to go from the search bar to the People Search page: they weren't able to find what they were looking for from the search bar. If I couldn't find what I wanted to in the search bar, and then was re-directed to a page that displayed the exact same search bar with the exact same results, I would be a mixture of frustrated and disappointed.\r\n\r\nI think instead, if we did want to redirect to the People Search page automatically, we should show the current search page and populate the fields with the person's search bar query. That would mean naively putting their search into the first name field if they only put one word in, but that's still better than showing them a bigger version of the same thing they were just looking at.\r\n\r\nFor the record, I don't think hitting enter in the search bar should redirect someone to the People Search page. Instead, we should adjust the highlighting so that the first element in the results is highlighted by default:\r\n<img width=\"288\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35319956/166314896-2df85ce4-df1e-44d2-89b4-e2bb642c31a0.png\">\r\nThis way it's more clear to the user what will happen if they hit enter.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we could include a \"advanced search\" link at the bottom of the search bar results list that redirects to the People Search page (possibly pre-filled with their search bar query). So when someone scrolls through all the search bar results without finding what they were looking for they can go straight to advanced search. That seems like a more natural and fluid set of use cases in my opinion.", "I agree with Evan.  We should highlight the top entry by default to make the current behavior clearer.  Already, using up/down arrows highlights the other entries, and \"enter\" goes to the page for the selected user.  So the only flaw is not starting with the top item highlighted. " ],

This violates the HTML specification and can lead to inconsistent rendering across browsers as well as difficulties for assistive technologies to interpret the list structure correctly.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Go to /reference/p5/arc/\n2.  Locate to the following element:\n#main-content > div.md\\:mx-lg.mt-md.mx-5 > div:nth-child(2) > section > ul\n(This issue is since to be a global issue)\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe `<ul>` element contains elements other than `<li>`, `<script>`, or `<template>` as direct children.\nThe `<ul>` element includes disallowed direct children (e.g., `<div>`, `<p>`, etc.) rather than wrapping all content within `<li>`, `<script>`, or `<template>` elements.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nEnsure all ordered (`<ol>`) and unordered (`<ul>`) list elements only have the following elements as direct children:\n- `<li>`\n- `<script>`\n- `<template>`\nAny other elements should be wrapped appropriately within `<li>` elements.\n\n### Environments\n\n_No response_\n\n### Suggested Fix\n\nRefactor the markup so that all direct children of `<ul>` or `<ol>` that are not `<li>`, `<script>`, `<template>` elements are wrapped within `<li>` elements. For example:\n```html\n<ul class=\"content-grid-simple\">\n  <li><div>Content</div></li>\n</ul>\n```\n\n### Reference\n\nWCAG:\n- [1.3.1 - Info and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#info-and-relationships)\n\nWCAG-T:\n- [H48: Using ol, ul and dl for lists or groups of links](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/html/H48)\n- [F43: Failure of Success Criterion 1.3.1 due to using structural markup in a way that does not represent relationships in the content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/failures/F43)\n\nother:\n- [ARIA: list role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/list_role)\n- [ARIA: listitem role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/listitem_role)\n\n### What is your operating system?\n\nNone\n\n### Web browser and version\n\n_No response_",

Backend Adjustments (`services/supabase`)\n- Refactor all code references to `owner_id` across query logic, types, and service utilities.\n- Ensure all affected endpoints and mutations behave as expected with the updated schema.\n\n### 3. Frontend Integration (`apps/web`)\n- Update Supabase queries, types, and hooks that reference `owner_id`.\n- Refactor relevant components or forms handling project ownership or user metadata.\n- Run and update any impacted unit tests or mocks accordingly.\n\n### 4. Documentation\n- Update schema diagrams, ERD references, and technical documentation under `docs/` to reflect the updated field naming and align with project terminology.\n\n###  Deliverables\n- Fully working PR with schema + code changes.\n- A Supabase CLI-compatible SQL migration script.\n- Clear changelog and commit breakdown.\n- Optional: Schema diff or notes for internal dev reference.\n\n**ETA:** I estimate 36–48 hours for full implementation, testing, and documentation updates.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to take it! \nHappy to help standardize and improve the DB structure.\n", "# Hi there, @4c1d-V \uD83D\uDC4B You've been assigned this issue.\n\nOne invite is waiting for you in your email.

However, its usefulness is quite limited, as there is still no obvious way to use them in forms, because they do not implement `AsFormField`.\n\nFor `Weekday`, we implement `AsFormField` manually:\n\nhttps://github.com/cot-rs/cot/blob/144a377acb646852cbdf8a4b2c174b130003ecef/cot/src/form/fields/chrono.rs#L8-L54\n\nFor user-defined enums, I think there are two possible ways to tackle this:\n\n1. Add a derive macro that would create generic `AsFormField` `impl`s for the enum as well as `Vec<T>`, `HashSet<T>`, etc., similarly to the ones for `Weekday`.\n2. Add wrapper structs (e.g. `Choice` and `ChoiceMultiple`) that would contain the enum implementing SelectChoice, and a `Vec` of these, respectively.\n\nWhich of these would be more appropriate is subject to discussion.

Right now we have any_view and utf_view which are c++29 things --  and they're taking the approach of a single repo per range/view.  So I think that's likely what we should do until we have a big enough collection of range things to put them together -- which sounds like a packaging thing.

I'll take a look at that PR; it looks interesting.\n\nNow coming to the actual implementation stuff:\nI think I'd like to start with one of the simpler papers (in the first comment in this issue) and not directly get started with `concat`, which was noted to be quite difficult. This will help me get used to the workflow as well as the implementation side of things, which I personally don't have too much experience with yet.\n\nIn particular, `std::views::indices` looks to me like the perfect trial grounds for that.\n\nSo, to that end, if I understood the instructions correctly, I should make a repo called `view_indices`? (I'm not exactly sure what the name should be for this one to allow for maximum clarity.)", "I looked through the `std::views::indices` paper, and to me, it looks too small to me to warrant a repo of its own.", "I did a little research and found that `.` is a valid character in repo names so we should have no issues with making repos like\n- `ranges_and_views.indices`\n- `ranges_and_views.to_input`\n- `ranges_and_views.cache_last`\n- `ranges_and_views.concat`\n\nEven though packaging is further into the future (as in, we can't think about packaging if there's nothing _to_ package \uD83D\uDE04), this _should_ make it easier for a bot or whatever to find and pick up these repos and put them together.", "So this is a bit of a naming bikeshed that we shouldn't get too concerned with because repo names can also be changed later. We have 2 view types and so far they follow the naming pattern of `type_view` -- so `utf_view` and `any_view`.  These names are succint and simple. So for the above I'd suggest `indicies_view`, `to_input_view`, etc. \n\nw.r.t. sufficient size to warrent a repo, I'm certainly sympathetic to that thought -- it feels really heavy for a < 100 sloc project.  But the issue I see, is one might start to wonder why `utf_view` and `any_view` live elsewhere and aren't part of `ranges_and_views`. After all, they are....\n\n> we can't think about packaging if there's nothing to package\n\nreally, that's the key point :) We need an implementation on the ground before anything else really matters.  Everything we're discussing here is changable later...", "> So for the above I'd suggest `indicies_view`, `to_input_view`, etc.\n\nGot it \uD83D\uDC4D.

However, Apple uses an older version of Clang (v17) in its XCode SDK, so the bug is still showing up. But the bug is fixed upstream (in LLVM). We simply need to wait for XCode to release a version with a recent-enough version of Clang, to remove the workaround I have in place.\n\nI also linked to a [Godbolt example](https://godbolt.org/z/fjbo87MbK) demonstrating the issue in the comments.\n\n> So for changes in the future I suggest making an issue -- making a branch associated with that issue -- and then a request to merge to main.\n\nUnderstood. sorry about that \uD83D\uDE05\n\n> Lol I suppose we haven't written this down!\n\nI think you're right.

Ideally we want the default value to be rendered in the props table, rather than rendering as though there isn't any default value currently.\n\n\nOriginal comment:\n\nThe `Spinner` component hardcodes `aria-label` attribute when neither `aria-label` nor `aria-labelledby` is provided.\n\nhttps://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/blob/3ba79b0c6c6e750996f6134251dc6c6bd5eeb28a/packages/react-core/src/components/Spinner/Spinner.tsx#L47\n\n**How do you reproduce the problem?**\n\nMount a `Spinner` without providing an `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`.\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nA spinner without a hardcoded English value. The component should allow consumers to use it without `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`. It might be just a complementary visual hint hidden from the a11y tree using `aria-hidden` when rendered alongside relevant text.\n\n**Is this issue blocking you?**\n\nSomehow. A workaround exists by setting `aria-labelledby`, but it would be preferable if, as said above, the spinner could be used as a visual hint for sighted users while being excluded from the a11y tree.\n\n**Screenshots**\n\nN/A\n\n**What is your environment?**\n\nN/A\n\n**What is your product and what release date are you targeting?**\n\nN/A\n\n**Any other information?**\n\n- The [Spinner props documentation](https://www.patternfly.org/components/spinner#spinner) does not mention a default value for `aria-label`.\n- This behavior was introduced in commit 09733cb4f0fc5cd67f5df284 as part of https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/pull/6730, but I was not able to find the reasoning there.\n- `aria-valuetext` also has a hardcoded default value, even when it may not be applicable.\n\n  > `aria-valuetext` is only needed when the numeric value of `aria-valuenow` is not meaningful.  \n  >\n  > [MDN Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-valuetext)\n",

Semantically having the Spinner exposed may make more sense as well than just plain text.\n\nAt least according to MDN, either aria-label or aria-labelledby is also required on the progressbar role. That I think makes sense since just the aria-valuenow content (be it \"Loading\" or something similar) doesn't provide great context (what exactly is loading?).\n\nThough I might strongly recommend against it, if `aria-hidden` is being passed to a Spinner, that should somewhat resolve the issue of having a default aria-label applied.

My fault! I completely overlooked the `progressbar` role that the Spinner SVG is using! That’s why I wasn’t fully understanding the decision of going for these default values.\n\nRegarding having both the `aria-label` and the static text, I thought it might be redundant and possibly annoying for screen reader users, especially if both contain the same message. In any case, now that I have a better understanding, I’ll rework my use of the Spinner to include only one descriptive text. Either by using `aria-labelledby` or by adding `aria-hidden` to the static text if it doesn’t provide any additional value.\n\n> That I think makes sense since just the aria-valuenow content (be it \"Loading\" or something similar) doesn't provide great context (what exactly is loading?).\n\nFully agree. \"Loading\" alone lacks the necessary context.\n\n> \n> Though I might strongly recommend against it, if `aria-hidden` is being passed to a Spinner, that should somewhat resolve the issue of having a default aria-label applied. While the aria-label will still be there, the Spinner won't be in the a11y tree.\n> \n\nNo doubts, I’ve got a long road ahead on my accessibility learning journey, as this issue has proven. That said, in my tests, when `aria-hidden` is applied, the entire Spinner is removed from the accessibility tree, including its `aria-label` (checked with Chrome and Firefox developer tools) .\n\n> I do think we can tweak the Spinner code so that the default value of aria-label is rendered in the props table, though.\n\nAgain, thank you for your enlightening explanation and please excuse me for reporting this as an issue when it clearly wasn’t one \uD83D\uDE4F ", "It's better to raise an issue that may turn out to be intended behavior than have something sneak by us, so absolutely no worries opening this! We don't know what we don't know and all, and whether it leads to us fixing/adding something to improve the user experience or just a good discussion, it's worth it.\n\nI'll edit your original comment just to note what this issue should go towards resolving (updating how we're defining the default value). If you'd be interested in working on it just let me know and I can assign you (no pressure to, though), otherwise I can put a \"good first issue\" label for others to pick it up.", "> If you'd be interested in working on it just let me know and I can assign you (no pressure to, though), otherwise I can put a \"good first issue\" label for others to pick it up.\n\nI fear I'm a bit busy these days \uD83D\uDE22 for investing the time it needs to be not only changed but also properly tested. So, I'd label it as good first issue and give others a chance to work on it.\n\nThat said, just in case could be useful for others, as far as I could check, https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-org is relying on https://github.com/reactjs/react-docgen for generating the [PropsTable](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-org/blob/main/packages/documentation-framework/components/propsTable/propsTable.js#L18). Thus, I guess it could be as simple as moving the default value to the props initialization as shown in below diff\n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/packages/react-core/src/components/Spinner/Spinner.tsx b/packages/react-core/src/components/Spinner/Spinner.tsx\nindex 77e599773..4099da094 100644\n--- a/packages/react-core/src/components/Spinner/Spinner.tsx\n+++ b/packages/react-core/src/components/Spinner/Spinner.tsx\n@@ -32,7 +32,7 @@ export const Spinner: React.FunctionComponent<SpinnerProps> = ({\n   'aria-valuetext': ariaValueText = 'Loading...',\n   diameter,\n   isInline = false,\n-  'aria-label': ariaLabel,\n+  'aria-label': ariaLabel = 'Contents',\n   'aria-labelledBy': ariaLabelledBy,\n   ...props\n }: SpinnerProps) => (\n@@ -42,9 +42,7 @@ export const Spinner: React.FunctionComponent<SpinnerProps> = ({\n     aria-valuetext={ariaValueText}\n     viewBox=\"0 0 100 100\"\n     {...(diameter && { style: { [cssDiameter.name]: diameter } as React.CSSProperties })}\n-    {...(ariaLabel && { 'aria-label': ariaLabel })}\n-    {...(ariaLabelledBy && { 'aria-labelledBy': ariaLabelledBy })}\n-    {...(!ariaLabel && !ariaLabelledBy && { 'aria-label': 'Contents' })}\n+    {...(ariaLabelledBy ? { 'aria-labelledBy': ariaLabelledBy } : { 'aria-label': ariaLabel })}\n     {...props}\n   >\n     <circle className={styles.spinnerPath} cx=\"50\" cy=\"50\" r=\"45\" fill=\"none\" />\n```\n\nHowever, this approach puts the component at risk of having neither `aria-label` nor `aria-labelledby` if the consumer passes an empty string for the former and omits the latter.

      "description" : "## TLDR\n\nIn expressions, `foo/bar` bad, `./foo/bar` good\n\n## Is your feature request related to a problem?\n\nMost path literal expressions start with `./` in practice. (if not `../`)\nThis is a good practice because it makes it clear from the start what's the role of the text that follows.\n\nIn fact the use of path literal expressions like `foo/bar.nix` is sufficiently rare that experienced Nixers are unaware of this possibility (https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/413892)\n\nPerhaps the time has come to take this convention.\n\n## Proposed solution\n\n1. Add a setting to warn or fail when a relative path is encountered that does not start with a `.`\n2. After some time, default the setting to warn by default\n\nI'd stop there, so that we can keep evaluating old expressions without significant intervention.\nOpting out of an error may be hard when multiple hosts are involved in a deployment process that involves evaluation.\n\n## Alternative solutions\n\n**Linting**. This is far less effective. We want everyone to stop using this syntax, not just those who have the knowledge and headspace for it, and we want good coverage; not just the projects that have integrated tooling.\n\n## Additional context\n\n- Similar to https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/8738\n\n- A language redesign could parse `./foo/bar` as syntax sugar for `${.}/foo/bar` or `(.)/foo` or something. We can't do that because we want to stay compatible, and that involves parsing things like `foo/bar` directly as a path literal anyway.\n\n## Checklist\n\n<!-- make sure this issue is not redundant or obsolete -->\n\n- [ ] checked [latest Nix manual] \\([source])\n- [ ] checked [open feature issues and pull requests] for possible duplicates\n\n[latest Nix manual]: https://nixos.org/manual/nix/unstable/\n[source]: https://github.com/NixOS/nix/tree/master/doc/manual/source\n[open feature issues and pull requests]: https://github.com/NixOS/nix/labels/feature\n\n---\n\nAdd :+1: to [issues you find important](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc).\n",

      "description" : "**Describe the bug**\r\nTalk back is not reading Arabic language in Audio Language dialog box \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Go to 'Place Values'\r\n2. Double tap on 'What are place values'\r\n3. Double tap on 'Audio' button\r\n4. Double tap on 'Change language' icon\r\n5. Audio Language dialog box appears\r\n6. Swipe across the various languages\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nTalk back to read all the language names including Arabic\r\n\r\n\r\n**Environment**\r\nDevice name: One plus Nord2 5G\r\nAndroid version : Android 11\r\nApp version : 0.7-alpha-d1b2827517\r\n\r\n**Explanation and suggested solution**\r\nIn `LanguageDialogFragment`, we use ` appLanguageResourceHandler.computeLocalizedDisplayName(audioLanguage)` to get the display name for ecah language. The Arabic language therefore is displayed in Arabic characters, which talkback, when localized to English, cannot read. \r\n\r\nTalkback relies on content descriptions where available, but since this list is dynamic, we can use an accessibility delegate to instruct talkback on how to read Arabic(and Hindi too).\r\n\r\nWhen creating the dialog, override the accessibility properties of the list items by accessing the AlertDialog's ListView after creation:\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\nval options = languageNameArrayList.toTypedArray<CharSequence>()\r\nval languageInterface: LanguageInterface = parentFragment as AudioFragment\r\n\r\nval alertDialog = AlertDialog.Builder(ContextThemeWrapper(activity as Context, R.style.OppiaDialogFragmentTheme))\r\n  ...\r\n    .create()\r\n\r\nalertDialog.setOnShowListener {\r\n    val listView = alertDialog.listView\r\n    for (i in 0 until listView.childCount) {\r\n        val item = listView.getChildAt(i)\r\n        item?.setAccessibilityDelegate(object : View.AccessibilityDelegate() {\r\n            override fun onInitializeAccessibilityNodeInfo(\r\n                host: View?,\r\n                info: AccessibilityNodeInfo?\r\n            ) {\r\n                super.onInitializeAccessibilityNodeInfo(host, info)\r\n                // Get the item text\r\n           \r\n                // Set content description for TalkBack\r\n                        }\r\n        })\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nreturn alertDialog\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nUI tests are expected for the submitted code.\r\n",

For devices where this setting is not set to Arabic, this results in any Arabic words being skipped.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-07-12 at 12 38 19 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17b33f5d-1e10-4ab2-b33b-042bbd90f4c9)\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the current behavior means that the other languages in the list _aren't_ being read in their native TTS languages, which can be confusing to understand (eg. the Chinese characters for Mandarin Chinese are read in a hard-to-understand English TTS 'accent'). \r\n\r\n**Proposed Approach**\r\nUpdate `AppLanguageResourceHandler::computeLocalizedDisplayName` so that it returns a `SpannableString` instead of a `String` and wrap the returned string with `LocaleString.` By doing so, we can specify a locale that allows TalkBack to dyanmically switch to the proper TTS voice based on the language. This change would also require updating the `OptionsAudioLanguageViewModel` and `AudioLanguageSelectionViewModel` display language property to use `SpannableString` instead of `String.` \r\n\r\nLet me know if these are the methods/files that should be updated in this fix, thanks!\r\n\r\n", "Hi @elin4046, thanks for researching this. I have a few follow ups:\r\n- Typically, we don't use Locale directly in the codebase. However, if you can create a function in  the `OppiaLocale` class, it might work.\r\n- Configuring locale specific tts voice is technically out of scope for this issue. However, if it is an automatic side effect of the fix, then we can test it out and get product feedback on it. \r\n\r\n\r\nDo you mind  trying this fix and doing a screen recording so we can see what it is like?\r\n\r\n**Additional Context**\r\nThe Oppia app is set up to use the device language by default, and if the device is configure in mandarin for example, most tts will be in mandarin. However, for app strings, mandarin is not one of the translated languages we currently support, and talkback relies on content descriptions to describe the app, so for untranslated strings will default to English.", "@theayushyadav11, here's another issue to look at.

That would have the benefit of keeping the Briefcase docs on the Briefcase page, but would ensure that multiple versions say aligned.", "Thinking out loud....\r\n\r\nWhat if we leverage git submodules?\r\n\r\nIn this way, a new repo would contain the common documentation and the project repos would add this new repo as a submodule; then the docs could be built using a single source of truth for common documentation.\r\n\r\nFor instance: https://github.com/davidfischer/sphinx-with-submodules", "Put together a quick PoC.\r\n\r\nIn a [copy](https://github.com/rmartin16/briefcase-test) of the Briefcase repo, I added a new [repo](https://github.com/rmartin16/beeware-common-docs-test) as a [submodule](https://github.com/rmartin16/briefcase-test/tree/main/docs) in the `docs` directory. Then, I [reference](https://github.com/rmartin16/briefcase-test/blob/467fafe36679c579c0400f20603654295785e2a1/docs/index.rst?plain=1#L18) the `common-1.rst` file from the Briefcase's `index.rst`.\r\n\r\nproject repo: https://github.com/rmartin16/briefcase-test\r\ncommon doc repo: https://github.com/rmartin16/beeware-common-docs-test\r\n\r\nThis all works rather seamlessly, IMO. There will need to be a workflow to bump the submodule commit in the project repos when the common doc repo is updated, though.\r\n\r\n[edit] I guess a major issue this is likely to create is unaware contributors trying to build docs without the submodule....since `git` apparently doesn't clone submodules by default. So, anyone trying to build docs will need to run `git submodule update --init` or have run `git clone --recurse-submodules` initially...", "> What if we leverage git submodules?\r\n\r\nThat's definitely one way to avoid reproducing content; I'm not sure how I feel about it, though. I've historically avoided submodules unless I absolutely have to use them - I've found them to be one of those features that superficially works, but ends up making your life a whole lot more complicated in the long run (especially for contributors that haven't got experience with submodules - which is most of them).\r\n\r\nAt the risk of re-inventing the wheel - I wonder if it might be more reliable to use the same general approach, but build the subrepo cloning part as a build pre-processing step using regular git cloning.", "> I've found them to be one of those features that superficially works, but ends up making your life a whole lot more complicated in the long run (especially for contributors that haven't got experience with submodules - which is most of them).\r\n\r\nThis is fair and definitely one of my concerns for a submodule.\r\n\r\n> At the risk of re-inventing the wheel - I wonder if it might be more reliable to use the same general approach, but build the subrepo cloning part as a build pre-processing step using regular git cloning.\r\n\r\nhmm...this definitely ventures in to wheel reinvention territory.\r\n\r\nWhile this approach avoids the submodule, it introduces ambiguities that the submodule makes explicit. Notably, the current version of the \"common docs\" incorporated in to any single project's published docs is implicit. Now, we can create workflows around ensuring any updates committed to the \"common docs\" are more or less immediately pushed to dependent repos....but that doesn't remove the inherent implicit nature of which version of the \"common docs\" is being used.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if we're willing to automate the management of pulling and building docs from a remote repo, then it seems much more trivial to simply have `tox` ensure the submodule is initialized and updated prior to building the docs....rather than trying to manually clone a repo and add it to the project's docs.\r\n\r\nBut, even then, the \"common docs\" commit used for the submodule in a project repo still needs to be maintained. So, either way, we need a process to ensure updates in the \"common docs\" are disseminated to relevant repos and their docs are republished.\r\n\r\nGiven the submodule is only necessary to build the docs...and the only real way to build the docs is to run `tox`, I think much of the concern of contributors getting caught up in having to understand submodules can be avoided. That said, I don't have strong feelings and don't have much experience managing a submodule over time.", "> > At the risk of re-inventing the wheel - I wonder if it might be more reliable to use the same general approach, but build the subrepo cloning part as a build pre-processing step using regular git cloning.\r\n> \r\n> hmm...this definitely ventures in to wheel reinvention territory.\r\n> \r\n> While this approach avoids the submodule, it introduces ambiguities that the submodule makes explicit.\r\n\r\nThat would depend a bit on the implementation - we could make our implementation use specific git hash or similar. However, at the very least, a non-trivial re-implementation of a not-insignificant portion of git submodules would be required.\r\n\r\n> Given the submodule is only necessary to build the docs...and the only real way to build the docs is to run `tox`, I think much of the concern of contributors getting caught up in having to understand submodules can be avoided. \r\n\r\nThat's a fair point. My experience is that the core git submodule implementation \"works\" - it's just near-impossible for a normal human to consistently drive correctly. These problems stem from the fact that submodules aren't deeply integrated into the \"default\" git workflow, so you end up with stale checkouts, or incompatible checkouts, or something else like that. \r\n\r\nIf we can make the existence of the submodules completely transparent to the end user - so running `tox e docs/docs-lint/docs-live` *completely* manages submodule cloning, updating, etc; and the existence of the submodule doesn't impact on any other development behavior (e.g., causing issues switching between branches), then this might be an approach worth pursuing.\r\n", "A sync between the Toga and Briefcase contribution guides is in progress. \n\nThere is a somewhat significant amount of duplicated content between the two code contribution guides, and the documentation guides are 99.9% the same. I feel the idea of consolidating content is a discussion worth continuing.\n\nI put some time into looking into whether there were any options, inherent to Sphinx, available for consolidating content. As far as I can tell, Sphinx does not support any features that would do this natively. Directly cloning the repo would avoid submodules, but the issue of being able to edit the common docs in the wrong location seems as possible with this method as with submodules. Other than this issue, the rest could be made relatively transparent to the user.\n\nAnother issue that came up is searchability. Users have reported that it's difficult to find info with the docs being spread across multiple repos. Something that is worth looking into for this are [Read the Docs subprojects](https://docs.readthedocs.com/platform/stable/subprojects.html). This would require having a \"primary\" documentation repo, perhaps on `beeware/beeware`, that the rest of the tools are added to as subprojects. Then, the docs would be searchable across all projects - the project-wide search is available from the \"primary\" project, as well as any of the subprojects. The search has a checkbox for \"Include subprojects\" and that is how you choose to search all the projects at once - there is an [active issue](https://github.com/readthedocs/addons/issues/22) open to add the ability to configure it to be checked by default. This change may effect some of the plan [here](https://github.com/beeware/beeware/discussions/522#discussioncomment-13502604), so it's something we would need to discuss. ", "> Another issue that came up is searchability. Users have reported that it's difficult to find info with the docs being spread across multiple repos.\n\nOnce the docs are all moved to beeware.org subdomains, it'll become possible to do this with an external search engine that supports filtering by domain, e.g. Google has `site:beeware.org`." ],

The tutorial is available in the [Devopness Guide][1]. To support users during these workflows, help documentation is displayed via the `?` buttons on various pages.\n\nHowever, several challenges have been identified:\n1. **Missing Documentation**: Some pages accessed during the tutorial do not have associated help documentation, leaving users without guidance when they need it most.\n2. **Incorrect Documentation Paths**: Certain help articles exist but are not properly linked, making them inaccessible via the `?` button.\n3. **Outdated Instructions**: Some help documentation reflects older UI/UX flows that have since been updated, causing confusion for users who rely on these instructions.\n\nThis issue aims to address these challenges by ensuring all tutorial steps and key pages have complete, accurate, and actionable help documentation. By doing so, we can enhance the onboarding experience, provide clarity, and ensure users can complete workflows efficiently.\n\n---\n\n### **Task List**\n\n#### Missing Documentation\n- [x] #1203\n- [x] #1206\n- [ ] #1207\n- [ ] #1208\n- [x] #1209\n- [x] #1210\n- [ ] #1211\n- [ ] #1212\n- [ ] #1213\n- [ ] #1214\n- [x] #1215\n- [x] #1216\n- [x] #1217\n- [x] #1204\n- [ ] #1205\n\n\n---\n\n#### Path Fixes\n- [ ] #1218\n- [ ] #1219\n\n---\n\n#### Improvements to Existing Documentation\n- [x] #1220\n- [x] #1221\n- [x] #1223\n\n[1]: https://devopness.com/docs\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nAll tutorial steps and key pages should have complete, accurate, and actionable help documentation accessible via the `?` buttons. Users should be able to follow workflows without confusion or interruption.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Go to the [Devopness tutorial](https://devopness.com/docs).\n2. Navigate through the tutorial steps (e.g., projects, environments, servers).\n3. Click on the ? button for help documentation on pages listed in the issue (e.g., projects/list-projects, teams/list-teams).\n4. Observe whether the expected help documentation is available or accessible.\n\n### Which Devopness module(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nDocumentation\n\n### Package Version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Reproduction link\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional details\n\n_No response_",

We’ve noticed that other users have reported similar issues, as seen in the forum thread you are mentioning. However, we kindly ask that such discussions be continued there in order to keep issues at one place and as this tracker is intended for framework-related issues. Once solution is found and its only a matter of integration, a PR https://github.com/armbian/build/pulls should be opened - by anyone.\n\nThis particular bug appears to be tied to the specific hardware/kernel combination and not related to Armbian OS or assembly itself. It's worth noting that this issue does not manifest on Raspberry Pi or x86 platforms, which benefit from significantly larger development resources — for instance, Raspberry Pi OS has a dedicated full-time staff and a yearly budget exceeding 1 million USD. In contrast, Armbian relies heavily on community support and volunteer contributions with budget ([taken from here](https://github.com/sponsors/armbian)). And we compile 80 different kernels for docents of platforms. Most of them are not even close to level of Raspberry Pi. And even there, users finds issues https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/issues\n\nAs frustrating as it may be, the reality in open source is that some issues—especially those requiring deep investigation—can take years to resolve. We fully understand the inconvenience and appreciate your patience and contributions." ],

      "description" : "# Bug\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  I'm trying to play a video in a real iOS device that is too heavy (2 min length) and it size is 429.7 MB. In Android i was able to change the bufferConfig prop and i tested in a real Android device and it works, but in iOS, i changed the prop `preferredForwardBufferDuration` but the video still stop playing after some seconds because the loaded buffer isn't enough to continue playing the video. Moreover, i tested setting `automaticallyWaitsToMinimizeStalling` to false but it doesn't work. \r\nWhat i understood is that if i put `preferredForwardBufferDuration=15` it means that the player will load 15 video seconds into the memory before continue playing the video but it doesn't work like that. It seems that preferredForwardBufferDuration is always in 0\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Platform\r\n<!--\r\niOS AVplayer\r\n-->\r\nWhich player are you experiencing the problem on:\r\n* iOS real device (iPhone 11).\r\n\r\n## Environment info\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Run `react-native info` in your terminal and copy the results here.

However, when editing the name of the task, sometimes the app lets you keep the line break on it.\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d4a8beb-35d4-4f34-8042-5e5e31deeaaa\n\nThis example was a simplification of the issue, but some apps / sites add a invisible line break after the copied text, so this issue might appear more often.\n\n(TBH it doesn't seem like this is a deal breaker, but I can imagine this having some potential issues if any other area of the app is not expecting line breaks at all on this field, so I am creating this issue just in case).\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Open any Note-taking app to test this out\n2. Write any sentence in two lines, with an Enter line-break. Example:\n\n```\nthis is \na test\n```\n\n3. Copy this text\n4. Add a new task in Super Productivity\n5. Paste the text on the name field of the task, and save (pressing Enter or clicking away from the task field)\nYou will notice that the line breaks got stripped down and the text is in a single line\n7. Select the name field of the task again, and paste the text again on it.\nYou _should_ notice that the text is now in multiple lines.\n\n### Can you reproduce this reliably?\n\nYes, I can reproduce it reliably.\n\n### Console Output\n\n```shell\n\n```",

This causes delays, unnecessary follow-ups, and risks around incorrect or incomplete releases.\nWe believe we already know the core information needed to initiate a release (e.g., release identifier, target component, identity version). By formalizing how this is collected, we can empower engineers to submit higher-quality requests and reduce the coordination burden on the release manager.\nWhat we aim to do in this task:\nDefine the minimum required fields engineers must provide when requesting a release (e.g., release identifier, target component, identity version). Create a lightweight, accessible format for collecting this information, for example a Slack form. Align with the release manager to ensure this structure covers all needed details.\n\n## Goal\n\nA clearly documented and easy-to-use mechanism for engineers to request a release, integrated into our current channel #top-monorepo-release.\n",

I will write a brief TypeScript test to confirm that math.unit(5) compiles and yields a dimensionless Unit, and update the docs to illustrate this use.

The [W3C specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context-2/#trace-flags) for the flags only contains two flags, and it's my understanding that the `sampled` flag isn't particularly meaningful at the point where we're processing data in the Collector (it must necessarily be `1` since we have the trace).\r\n\r\nFrom what I can tell, we should offer a read-only `flags.random_trace_id` field or similar that provides a boolean representation of the `random-trace-id` flag.", "Reading more of the [field definition](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/blob/main/opentelemetry/proto/trace/v1/trace.proto#L114), it looks like there are a few more flags that can be stored in the field, but I still think we should consider offering paths for each flag. We could potentially offer something like `flags.raw_value` or similar for direct access to the bit sequence.", "@evan-bradley to start can we implement it like we implemented [flags for logs](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/421d710d3d8ceb28e375f57109ae976423713f9d/pkg/ottl/contexts/ottllog/log.go#L468-L480)", "Didn't realize logs had a flags field as well, thanks for pointing that out. Are you ware of any usages of that field? I think the UX is likely not very good:\r\n\r\n1. Reading out the flags as an integer doesn't seem immediately useful to me, I'm not clear what a user would be able to do with the raw value. Also since there are only a limited set of flags, it would probably make sense to have OTTL pull them out individually since we don't have the bitwise operations necessary to allow users to read them in a statement.\r\n2. Right now [the logs proto field](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/blob/main/opentelemetry/proto/logs/v1/logs.proto#L185) says it only contains W3C trace context flags, which I've been told should be considered read-only in Collector processors until someone comes to us with a compelling use case for writing to them. At a minimum, without bitwise operators they're going to be hard to work with.\r\n\r\nUnless users are looking for only access to the raw bit sequence, I think we should consider implementing something different for traces and look to update the logs context to match once we're happy with it.", "> Are you ware of any usages of that field\r\n\r\nI am not.\r\n\r\nIf the current logs implementation is not useful I am ok with implementing flags for spans with specific flags in mind, but I do think we should make a generic path like logs in case there is some custom function someone wants to build that does something with the raw flags.", "This issue has been inactive for 60 days.

The following sections will be managed by moderators only._\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n\n* Use of `cloneDeep` within the codebase should be replaced with `structuredClone`.\n\n## Implementation Brief\n\n* Wait until we upgrade our version of Node to at least `17` (probably `18`), see #6026.\n* Replace every import of `cloneDeep` with `structuredClone`, eg `cloneDeep( object )` to `structuredClone( object )`.\n* At the time of writing, we have usage in the following files:\n  * `assets/js/modules/analytics-4/datastore/properties.test.js`\n  * `assets/js/modules/analytics-4/components/module/ModulePopularPagesWidgetGA4/index.js`\n  * `assets/js/modules/analytics-4/components/dashboard/DashboardAllTrafficWidgetGA4/UserCountGraph.js`\n  * `assets/js/modules/analytics-4/components/dashboard/DashboardAllTrafficWidgetGA4/UserDimensionsPieChart.js`\n  * `assets/js/modules/analytics-4/utils/data-mock.js`\n  * `assets/js/modules/reader-revenue-manager/components/settings/SettingsEdit.stories.js`\n  * `assets/js/modules/reader-revenue-manager/datastore/publications.test.js`\n  * `assets/js/components/GoogleChart/utils.js`\n  * `assets/js/components/wp-dashboard/WPDashboardPopularPagesGA4.js`\n  * `storybook/utils/resetGlobals.js`\n\n### Test Coverage\n\n* Tests should continue to pass without change; no new tests are needed.\n\n## QA Brief\n\n* <!-- One or more bullet points for how to test that the feature works as expected. -->\n\n## Changelog entry\n\n* <!-- One sentence summarizing the PR, to be used in the changelog. -->\n",

At the time LTS was 16, but I think it's worth exploring an upgrade to 18 as some other updates depend on a newer version as well.\r\n\r\nThen we can implement this according to the IB.

See the `*ngIf=...`\n\n<img width=\"1100\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3075c04-2f08-4e52-a55d-82d425131116\" />",

However, `AMP` and `plots` must be set to False because they are currently hardcoded to use the CUDA device and will not utilize the XPU. It's worth noting that PyTorch does support AMP on XPU. Additionally, the `batch` parameter cannot be set to `-1`, as this will cause it to call the CUDA device.\n\n### Are you willing to submit a PR?\n\n- [x] Yes I'd like to help by submitting a PR!",

An Ultralytics engineer will review and assist you soon. Thank you for your willingness to contribute! \uD83D\uDEE0️", "Thanks for the detailed analysis! You're absolutely right about the XPU support limitations. The main areas that need updates for full XPU support are:\n\n1. The [`autocast` function](https://docs.ultralytics.com/reference/utils/torch_utils/#ultralytics.utils.torch_utils.autocast) in `torch_utils.py` currently only handles CUDA and CPU devices\n2. The [`check_amp` function](https://docs.ultralytics.com/reference/utils/checks/#ultralytics.utils.checks.check_amp) returns `False` for non-CUDA devices\n3. The [`select_device` function](https://docs.ultralytics.com/reference/utils/torch_utils/#ultralytics.utils.torch_utils.select_device) needs XPU device handling for auto-batch functionality\n\nYour PR would be very welcome!

The CUDA warning you're seeing is coming from the [`autocast` function](https://docs.ultralytics.com/reference/utils/torch_utils/#ultralytics.utils.torch_utils.autocast) which still defaults to `device=\"cuda\"` and needs updating to handle XPU devices properly.\n\nYou'll want to modify the autocast function to detect XPU and pass the correct device type to `torch.amp.autocast()`.

The attached files provide a great foundation - just make sure to test the device detection logic handles edge cases like `device=\"xpu:0\"` vs `device=\"xpu\"` consistently across all the modified functions.\n\nWe'd be happy to review and merge XPU support once it's submitted as a PR. Thanks for taking the initiative to get this working!", "@glenn-jocher I am sitting behind a corporate proxy that makes any outside update difficult.  If someone makes the requested changes, I can always test it out with the hardware available to me. Will have to explore internally to see if update is possible.\n\nIn the trainer.py is this a good option? If not, I am seeing a warning, but no other issues. I don't know if xpu supports GradScaler, but the code doesn't produce warning or error. The below logic can avoid a warning for XPU case, but might work in future if it is supported.\n\nLine 290\n\n        if torch.cuda.is_available():\n            self.scaler = (\n                torch.amp.GradScaler(\"cuda\", enabled=self.amp) if TORCH_2_4 else torch.cuda.amp.GradScaler(enabled=self.amp)\n            )\n        elif torch.xpu.is_available():\n            self.scaler = (torch.amp.GradScaler(self.device, enabled=self.amp))\n\nThe select_device method in torch_utils.py needs modification. The variable device is used interchangeably making it difficult. If we give device=0, what does it mean. It could be a GPU or XPU. At present I am passing device=\"xpu\" which limits its usage to one card. There are machines with more than one card.\n\nThere could be a machine with CPU, iGPU, NPU, dGPU (NVIDIA), dGPU (Intel called XPU), dGPU (AMD), and ASIC (Intel HPU) all in one machine. Checking logic like torch.cuda.is_available() or torch.xpu.is_available() or torch.cpu.is_available() will all return true because they are present in the system. This could lead to issues like user specifying device=0 which defaults to CUDA even though user might have selected XPU based on how the workload is running. If the user has done YOLO('yolov8l.pt').to(DEVICE), the DEVICE should be honored across the workflow logic. With what changes are proposed above, setting device=\"xpu\" or device=\"xpu:0\" should work. Selecting device=\"0\" on a XPU machine fails because it defaults to CUDA when it is not available. Multicard training needs further study because theoretically it should be same for CUDA or XPU.", "Thanks for the detailed analysis @azhuvath! I completely understand the corporate proxy constraints - that's a common challenge.\n\nYour GradScaler approach looks good, though I'd suggest checking `self.device.type == \"xpu\"` instead of `torch.xpu.is_available()` to ensure you're actually using an XPU device rather than just having XPU capability available.\n\nYou raise excellent points about the device selection complexity in multi-accelerator systems. The current logic in `select_device` does assume CUDA priority, which isn't ideal for XPU workflows. Your approach of explicitly passing `device=\"xpu\"` is the right pattern for now - it's clear and unambiguous.\n\nSince you're unable to submit PRs directly, perhaps @huahuadeliaoliao could incorporate your working changes into their planned PR? Your attached files provide a solid foundation and the performance results (15x over CPU, 2.5x with AMP) are compelling evidence this implementation works well.\n\nFor multi-XPU support, the pattern should indeed be similar to multi-GPU - handling device strings like `\"xpu:0,1\"` in the device parsing logic, though that can be a follow-up enhancement once basic XPU support is merged.", "@glenn-jocher I tested the changes on Intel Meteor Lake (MTL) iGPU (Integrated Graphics). It is working fine. So it should also work on Intel Lunar Lake (LNL) iGPU.

Below is the output I received:\n> \n> ```\n> RuntimeError                              Traceback (most recent call last)\n> Cell In[7], line 1\n> ----> 1 model.train(\n>       2     data=dataset_path,\n>       3     epochs=10,\n>       4     batch=16,\n>       5     imgsz=640,\n>       6     workers=4,\n>       7     amp=True,\n>       8     cache=True,\n>       9     patience=50,\n>      10     save_period=10,\n>      11     save=True,\n>      12     verbose=True,\n>      13     device=DEVICE\n>      14 )\n> \n> File /path/to/ultralytics/engine/model.py:797, in Model.train(self, trainer, **kwargs)\n>     797 self.trainer.train()\n> \n> File /path/to/ultralytics/engine/trainer.py:227, in BaseTrainer.train(self)\n>     227 self._do_train(world_size)\n> \n> File /path/to/ultralytics/engine/trainer.py:409, in BaseTrainer._do_train(self, world_size)\n>     409 loss, self.loss_items = self.model(batch)\n> \n> File /path/to/torch/nn/modules/module.py:1751, in Module._wrapped_call_impl(self, *args, **kwargs)\n>     1751 return self._call_impl(*args, **kwargs)\n> \n> File /path/to/torch/nn/modules/module.py:1762, in Module._call_impl(self, *args, **kwargs)\n>     1762 return forward_call(*args, **kwargs)\n> \n> File /path/to/ultralytics/nn/tasks.py:137, in BaseModel.forward(self, x, *args, **kwargs)\n>     137 return self.loss(x, *args, **kwargs)\n> \n> File /path/to/ultralytics/nn/tasks.py:337, in BaseModel.loss(self, batch, preds)\n>     337 return self.criterion(preds, batch)\n> \n> File /path/to/ultralytics/utils/loss.py:266, in v8DetectionLoss.__call__(self, preds, batch)\n>     266 pred_bboxes = self.bbox_decode(anchor_points, pred_distri)\n> \n> File /path/to/ultralytics/utils/loss.py:238, in v8DetectionLoss.bbox_decode(self, anchor_points, pred_dist)\n>     238 pred_dist = pred_dist.view(b, a, 4, c // 4).softmax(3).matmul(self.proj.type(pred_dist.dtype))\n> \n> RuntimeError: UR error\n> ```\n> \n> Let me know if you’ve encountered this before or if there's a step I might be overlooking.

Having multiple inputs, such as for the NWP forecast grid + raw observations to generate the next analysis grid to more closely match how analysis files are actually generated could be helpful. Additionally, multiple outputs would be helpful, for example for #20 to output both the next NWP state and satellite image, potentially at different resolutions (i.e. HRV vs non-HRV channels for EUMETSAT), or for having more dense local outputs, it could be the global graph, and a local graph output in the decoder.\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n<!--- Why is this change important to you? How would you use it? -->\r\n<!--- How can it benefit other users? -->\r\n\r\n## Possible Implementation\r\nUpdate the latent graph processor to take multiple encoders. Multple outputs can be achieved by taking the output from the graph processor and giving it as inputs into multiple decoders. There would just need to be a way to give multiple decoder configs to the overall model.\r\n",

First the Issue is explained. At the end you will find some guidance for first contributors. Please do not hesitate to ask questions. Your solution don't need to be perfect.\r\n\r\nParticipation or contribution is not recommended unless you are familiar with Back In Time and are an active user. This project is not intended for learning basic Python skills or enhancing your profile at Microsoft GitHub.\r\n\r\n# Problem & suggested solution\r\nIn the Shortcuts pane, there is Root and Home that open the respective content lists. When BiT is run as user, it points to the user's home folder, which is fine. Run as root, \"Home\" points to root's home folder, which is also fine, but the name is misleading here. It would be more clear to rename that pointer to \"Root\" or \"/root\". To avoid confusion of `/` \"Root\" and `/root` \"Root\", what is now \"Root\" (`/`) ought to be named more specifically, e.g. \"Filesystem\" or \"Root Filesystem\" or \"Filesystem Root\". If space is at a premium, omit the icons.\r\n\r\n# Your next steps\r\n1. If this is your first contribution in this project please introduce your self and tell us about your skills, wishes and plans. Also let us know how you found the issue and the project.\r\n2. Read the existing [contributors documentation](https://github.com/bit-team/backintime/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md).\r\n3. We can develop the next steps in the further discussion. Don't hesitate to ask.\r\n\r\n# Original post\r\n\r\nTwo cosmetic points that might make their way into a general GUI overhaul.\r\n\r\n- Get rid of that pesky \"Main profile\". The name is not meaningful and not editable, so one has to take notes what that profile actually does, or disable it altogether. Still when the GUI is launched, \"Main profile\" is opened first and complains if it can't find its backup folder. That in turn can be mitigated with a dummy backup folder that is always available (I use `/root/.backintime-dummy/` and  `/home/user/.backintime-dummy/`), but this is an ugly situation. I guess \"Main profile\" is a leftover from very early days of BiT when it had a more limited functionality. It' done it's job and can go now.\r\n\r\n- In the Shortcuts pane, there is Root and Home that open the respective content lists. When BiT is run as user, it points to the user's home folder, which is fine. Run as root, \"Home\" points to root's home folder, which is also fine, but the name is misleading here. It would be more clear to rename that pointer to \"Root\" or \"/root\".

You can't be sure anymore. And especially in open source projects, there is a lot of AI generated code from star-catching kids around. Sometimes it is hard to distinguish.\n\nOK, than go for it.\n\nFirst of all please check the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/bit-team/backintime/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nThe original issue is a bit broad and confuse because I wasn't sure myself how to solve the problem. It contains several issues and tasks. First of all I would say you can ignore the \"shortcuts pane\" and just work on the \"Root-Mode\" label in the status bar. This is a quit easy and tiny task to begin with. After that we can think about the \"shortcuts pane\".\n\nThe elements in the main window (including the status bar) are all defined in `qt/app.py` ([statusbar is here](https://github.com/bit-team/backintime/blob/de0838beedf8fae7e8970b8f76d37a0af2b2a906/qt/app.py#L287-L295)).

      "description" : "### Prerequisites\n\n- [x] I have written a descriptive issue title\n- [x] I have searched existing issues to ensure the bug has not already been reported\n\n\n### Fastify version\n\n5.2.1\n\n### Plugin version\n\n11.0.2\n\n### Node.js version\n\n22.14.0\n\n### Operating system\n\nmacOS\n\n### Operating system version (i.e. 20.04, 11.3, 10)\n\n15.5\n\n### Description\n\n## Background\n\nWe have a test scenario where our server immediately sends a websocket protocol \"ping\" upon a client connecting as part of starting a heartbeat. Currently the client created by `.injectWS()` does NOT register `ws.on(\"ping\", () => ws.pong())` causing this ping to be lost.\n\n## Attempted Workarounds\n\nWe've tried immediately registering it, but this causes a race condition as we don't get access to the websocket until after the connection has completed:\n\n```ts\nconst ws = server.injectWS(\"/ws\")\nws.on(\"ping\", () => ws.pong())\n```\n\nGiven the flakiness of this, we added a server side delay to starting the heartbeat. This is not ideal but is a sufficient workaround until a proper fix can be done.\n\n## Suggested Fix\n\nIt seems like a one line addition of `ws.on(\"ping\", () => ws.pong())` could be done here where `.on(\"open\", ...)` is already set:\n\nhttps://github.com/fastify/fastify-websocket/blob/90ac47d51d7b72c186311d0c58ded1af42a92a76/index.js#L67-L70\n\n## Impact & Risk of Change\n\nThis seems like a low impact change as no other aspects of testing the websocket outside of the built in ping/pong protocol seem to be impacted by this, as best I can tell. If that impact is still deemed too substantial then the desire to enable ping/pong could be done as part of the data handed to `.injectWS()`.\n\n## Closing Remarks\n\nJust wanted to say thank you for all the great work on `fustily-websocket`! We rely on it for production uses and have been extremely happy with it \uD83D\uDE04 I'm happy to open a small PR for this if desired. \n\n### Link to code that reproduces the bug\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/code-ape/bc6199713f9fee8415b6998db1b1f9fa\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe client created by `.injectWS()` should have `.on(\"ping\", () => ws.pong())` set by default.",

Please describe.\n\nCurrently, we allow descriptive stream names such as `NPP, ATMS` following a known convention in the satellite world. See [this example](https://github.com/ecmwf/WeatherGenerator/pull/328/files#diff-f893baba4f83facdfc557997e6bf4b389b927123e41035d4450fbb06e957b5f7). However, logging systems only want simple names for metrics such as `a.b.c`. where `a` is `a-zA-Z0-9-_` . It could be more but I would not push because it would break pandas column selection.\n\nAs a result, we cannot really have per-stream metrics, which would be useful for example to track how many samples are being ingested per stream. In this case it would be `streams.NPP, ATMS.count_samples` which would cause issues with WandB or MLFlow.\n\nI see 3 ways forward:\n\n- magic: conversion of `NPP, ATMS` to camelCase `NppAtms` for example\n- convention: only allow names that follow the convention above and return error instead\n- extra info: when defining a stream name, require a user to set an `stream_id` as a unique machine-ready identifier (for example `NPP_ATMS`)\n\nIn any case, I believe this name should be `a-zA-Z0-9_` (no _ to prevent weird issues with databases or pandas)\n\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/47964380/pandas-dataframe-column-naming-conventions\n\n\n\nDo you have any thoughts on that?\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Organisation\n\n_No response_",

Add `find_package(ament_cmake_python REQUIRED)` at the top, [as shown here](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/How-To-Guides/Ament-CMake-Python-Documentation.html#using-ament-cmake-python)\n    2. Add `ament_python_install_package(${PROJECT_NAME})` before the tests, [as shown here](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/How-To-Guides/Ament-CMake-Python-Documentation.html#using-ament-cmake-python)\n    3. Add some code for Python tests inside `if(BUILD_TESTING) ... endif()`, [as shown here](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/How-To-Guides/Ament-CMake-Python-Documentation.html#using-ament-cmake-pytest)\n1. `package.xml`:\n    1.

Since the files are almost the same, you could have one set of template files and only include the `ament_cmake_python` parts I described above using some `@[if ...]@` conditions in the `.em` template file _if_ the user selects ` --template-name python`.\n\nIf you've already made some changes in a branch, you could create a PR and we can discuss there.", "@christophebedard I am almost done with the changes, I just want to know on how to handle node name and library name ?\nDo I take those arguments in consideration and if yes, then which kind should be generated (python or cmake) ?" ],

During the first stage of training, the strong information bottleneck created by the VQ-VAE codebook forces the learned latent actions to capture only the information not inferable from task instructions—resulting in task-irrelevant latent actions.\n\nIn the second stage, with these task-irrelevant latents frozen, the newly initialized latent actions are trained to replace the role of language, allowing them to learn task-centric dynamics.\n\nThis also explains why, in naive latent action learning approaches like LAPA and Genie, latent action tokens mostly encode motion/dynamics—since texture information is already preserved from previous frames for future frame prediction in the decoder. ", "If your goal is to learn task-relevant tokens, why not directly use contrastive learning to encode those tokens and perform a soft alignment with the text instruction features? Have you tried this approach? It seems like a more straightforward way to achieve your objective.\n", "@retsuh-bqw Thanks for your detailed explanation.\n\nTo support your claims, I think it would be helpful to demonstrate what kind of behavior the latent actions actually exhibit.

      "description" : "### \uD83E\uDDED Epic\n\n**Title:** Configurable Connection-Retry Back-off for Database & Redis  \n**Goal:** Prevent gateway startup failures caused by slow-to-start services by making retry limits and intervals fully configurable. \n**Why now:** In containerised deployments Postgres (or any other SQL backend) and Redis often take several seconds to accept TCP connections. Today the gateway gives up on the first failure, crashing with `psycopg2.OperationalError: connection … refused`. Operators need a simple way—via environment variables, just like `DB_POOL_SIZE`, `CACHE_TYPE`, etc.—to tune how many times and how often the gateway retries before aborting.\n\n---\n\n### \uD83E\uDDED Type of Feature\n\n- [x] Enhancement to existing functionality\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDE4B‍♂️ User Story 1\n\n**As a:** DevOps engineer running MCP Gateway in Kubernetes  \n**I want:** to set `DB_MAX_RETRIES` and `DB_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS` for any SQLAlchemy-backed database  \n**So that:** the application patiently waits until the database container is ready, instead of crashing and restarting in a loop\n\n#### ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n```gherkin\nScenario: Database retries during startup\nGiven MCP Gateway starts with DB_MAX_RETRIES=10 and DB_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS=5000\nAnd the database is not yet ready\nWhen the first connection attempt fails\nThen the gateway should log \"DB connection failed (attempt 1/10), retrying in 5 s\"\nAnd it should retry every 5 s\nAnd after 10 failed attempts it should exit with a clear error message\n```\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDE4B‍♂️ User Story 2\n\n**As a:** Site Reliability Engineer using Redis caching  \n**I want:** analogous knobs `REDIS_MAX_RETRIES` and `REDIS_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS`  \n**So that:** the gateway’s cache layer behaves consistently with the database layer\n\n#### ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n```gherkin\nScenario: Redis retries respect custom settings\nGiven REDIS_MAX_RETRIES=15 and REDIS_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS=2000\nAnd Redis is unavailable\nWhen the cache subsystem initialises\nThen it must retry up to 15 times at 2 s intervals\nAnd surface a single aggregated error if all attempts fail\n```\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDE4B‍♂️ User Story 3\n\n**As a:** Platform administrator  \n**I want:** sensible defaults (3 retries × 2000 ms) so I don’t have to set anything for typical installs  \n**So that:** small deployments gain resilience out-of-the-box\n\n#### ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n```\n\nScenario: Defaults work when variables are unset\nGiven none of the four *_RETRIES or *_INTERVAL_MS variables are set\nWhen the gateway cannot reach the database\nThen it retries 3 times with 2 s between attempts\n\n```\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDCD0 Design Sketch (optional)\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\nsubgraph Settings\nENV[\".env / ENV vars\"]\nend\nENV --> Config[config.py load Settings]\nConfig -->|DB config| DBClient[SQLAlchemy Engine]\nConfig -->|Cache config| RedisClient[Redis Async Client]\n\nDBClient --> RetryLogic\nRedisClient --> RetryLogic\n\nRetryLogic{{\"Retry up to N timesnsleep(interval_ms)\"}}\nRetryLogic --> Logger\n```\n\n| Component | Change | Detail |\n|----------|--------|--------|\n| `config.py` | Add four `@env_settings` fields | `db_max_retries:int=3`, `db_retry_interval_ms:int=2000`, `redis_max_retries:int=3`, `redis_retry_interval_ms:int=2000` |\n| `db.py` | Wrap DB connect logic in retry loop | Use `asyncio.sleep()` for interval |\n| Redis cache init | Retry connect with same config | Applies if `CACHE_TYPE=redis` |\n| Logging | One log per retry attempt | Include attempt count and retry delay |\n| README | Add env var docs | Match style of existing DB/Redis config\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDD17 MCP Standards Check\n\n- [x] No protocol-level breaking changes\n- [x] Follows existing env var config conventions\n- [ ] Deviations: none\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDD04 Alternatives Considered\n\n| Alternative | Pros | Cons |\n|------------|------|------|\n| `docker-compose` healthcheck + `depends_on` | Simple for local dev | Doesn’t help bare-metal or k8s |\n| Exponential back-off | Faster in some cases | Adds complexity |\n| Gunicorn retry preload script | Works for some runners | Not general-purpose\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDCD3 Additional Context\n\n- Mirrors retry pattern used in `max_tool_retries`\n- Naming aligned with `DB_POOL_SIZE`, `CACHE_TYPE`, etc.\n- Ensure this is then changed in the helm chart.\n\nExample configuration:\n\n```bash\nexport DB_MAX_RETRIES=10\nexport DB_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS=5000\nexport REDIS_MAX_RETRIES=10\nexport REDIS_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS=5000\n```\n",

This feature allows testing any method, path, headers, or body directly from the Gateway UI.\n\n---\n\n### \uD83E\uDDED Type of Feature\n\n- [x] New functionality\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDE4B‍♂️ User Story 1\n\n**As a:** Gateway administrator  \n**I want:** to send custom HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.) to any path on the server I'm configuring  \n**So that:** I can debug connectivity, validate endpoint behavior, and inspect the actual server responses before saving\n\n#### ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n```gherkin\nScenario: Send a custom request to the server before saving\n  Given I am adding a new server in the Gateway UI\n  And I enter a server base URL\n  When I click \"Test Server\"\n  Then I should be able to:\n    - Choose an HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)\n    - Enter a relative path (e.g., /health)\n    - Provide optional headers and request body\n  When I click \"Send\"\n  Then the system sends the request to base_url + path\n  And I should see:\n    - HTTP status code\n    - Total response time (latency)\n    - Response body (pretty-printed JSON if possible)\n```\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDCD0 Design Sketch (optional)\n\n```\n+-------------------- Gateway UI ---------------------+\n| Server URL: https://api.example.com                |\n|                                                    |\n| [ Test Server ] ← opens test panel                 |\n+----------------------------------------------------+\n\n⇣ click\n\n+-------------------- Test Server --------------------+\n| Method: [GET ▼]                                     |\n| Path: /version                                      |\n| Headers (JSON): { \"Authorization\": \"Bearer xyz\" }  |\n| Body (JSON): { \"foo\": \"bar\" } (for POST, PUT...)   |\n| [ Send ]                                            |\n|                                                    |\n| ⇣ Results                                           |\n| ➤ Status: 200 OK                                    |\n| ➤ Latency: 120 ms                                   |\n| ➤ Response:                                         |\n| {                                                   |\n|   \"version\": \"1.0.0\",                               |\n|   \"status\": \"healthy\"                               |\n| }                                                   |\n+-----------------------------------------------------+\n```\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDD17 MCP Standards Check\n\n- [x] No impact on protocol or server discovery logic\n- [x] Safe, diagnostic-only feature\n- [x] Follows existing conventions for JSON and HTTP tooling\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDD04 Alternatives Considered\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons |\n|--------|------|------|\n| Predefined test list (/health, /version) | Simpler UI | Not flexible, less useful for real-world debugging |\n| Silent background ping | No UI work | Less control, can miss issues with specific headers/methods |\n| CLI-only debug tools | No frontend work | Fragments experience, not user-friendly\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDCD3 Additional Context\n\n- This is especially useful when:\n  - Testing authenticated or proxied servers\n  - Verifying custom response structures\n  - Diagnosing CORS or TLS errors from browser context\n- Future enhancements could include:\n  - Copy-as-curl button\n  - History of past test requests\n  - Auto-fill common headers like `Content-Type: application/json`\n",

Update the docs/docs/using/.pages file to add a link to this new mcp-cli documentation page for discoverability.\n\n3. Verify the instructions by testing mcp-cli usage with MCP Gateway and mcpgateway-wrapper locally if feasible.\n\nlet me know your thoughts and I can start working on it. ", "Sounds good, thanks!

I found that a lot of the fields used are actually types coming straight from `k8s` but are instead inlined in that module. In that 30m, I was able to reduce this file (https://github.com/kcl-lang/modules/blob/main/argo-workflow/v1alpha1/argoproj_io_v1alpha1_workflow.k) from 3.37MB to 2.7MB just by fixing references to schemas upstream, but there was a lot more that I could do.

      "description" : "This is a feature request to track a potential PR to implement it. I'm also looking for feedback for both naming and implementation preference.\n\nUsers can currently speed up Target Quality by only encoding down to only 1/4 of the frames in a chunk by specifying `--probing-rate 2..4`. We'll call this current behavior the \"rate\" strategy. We find this strategy acceptable because we consider that not all frames in a scene/chunk are necessary to accurately probe it and the speed-accuracy tradeoff is worth it. With that in mind, I propose a different strategy for reducing the computation in Target Quality probing: the \"subset\" strategy. This strategy would probe only the middle N frames in a chunk. Users can specify the number of frames to probe with `--probe-strategy subset --probing-subset N`. So for a given chunk of 400 frames, users can specify `--probing-subset 50` to probe only 50 frames in the middle.\n\nIt's possible to implement both strategies simultaneously but for simplicity we can only support just one strategy at a time. For now, I initially propose 2 new options: `--probe-strategy` (or alternatively `--probe-type`) and `--probing-subset <INT>`. The value for `--probe-stategy` can be `rate` or `subset` and defaults to `rate` to match the current behavior. `--probing-rate <INT>` will be ignored when using `--probe-strategy subset` and vice-versa for `--probing-subset <INT>` and `--probe-strategy rate` (default).\n\nI understand there are valid reasons to avoid using subsets in Target Quality mode, but I have had satisfactory results with this strategy in my own custom reimplementation of Target Quality and would like to see it implemented in the core product as an optional feature. I personally use ~20 frames per chunk so it's significantly faster than 1/4 of a very long chunk.\n\nThanks,\n\\- Boats M.",

Given that, it might be helpful to make this redirection behavior customizable.\n\nSuggestion:\nAdding an optional setting to disable pie menu redirection and instead allow the assigned command to execute would be very useful—especially for users who customize many shortcuts or manage complex menu systems.\n\nThis would remove unnecessary limitations and offer more flexibility in how users design their workflows.\n\n### Affected Desktop Environments\n\nWindows\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_",

When I do this, and I invoke Kando, Kando still remains with the old non-existing icons (probably because it uses a cache):\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dcc1eb3c-0054-4029-b9a0-f3520c3cbe4e)\n\nI also tried to use `kando --reload menu-theme` but it does not refresh the icons.

Forked and cloned the repository, then searched the codebase for `readline` usage to find the core input handling logic.\n2.  Identified `useKeypress.ts` (for raw keypress events) and `InputPrompt.tsx` (for input logic) as the key files.\n3.  To see what the application receives, I temporarily modified the code to log every keypress event to a `debug.log` file.\n4.  **Key Finding:** My initial debugging proved that on a default macOS Terminal, `Shift+Enter` sends the exact same sequence (`\\r`) as a regular `Enter` press, making the two indistinguishable.\n\n### Attempted Fix & The Final Discovery\n\nBased on the initial finding, I attempted a code-only fix by teaching the application to listen for a different key combination, `Shift+Down`, which often sends a unique sequence on other terminals.\n\n1. The Code I Tested\nI modified `useKeypress.ts` to listen for the `Shift+Down` sequence (`\\x1b[1;2B`) and `InputPrompt.tsx` to handle a `key.shift` flag.\n\n```typescript\n// In useKeypress.ts, I added a check:\nif (key.sequence === '\\x1b[1;2B') {\n  key.name = 'return';\n  key.shift = true;\n}\n```\n```typescript\n// In InputPrompt.tsx, I added the key.shift check:\nif (key.ctrl || key.meta || key.shift || charBefore === '\\\\' || key.paste) {\n  // ... newline logic\n}\n```\n\n2. The Result: It Also Failed\nThis proof-of-concept did not work. To understand why, I used the `cat` command to see what my terminal was actually sending when I pressed `Shift+Down`.\nFinal Proof: The terminal sent `^[[B`, which is the standard escape code for a plain Cursor Down key.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis investigation leads to a definitive conclusion: the default macOS Terminal is more limited than anticipated. It appears to strip the `Shift` modifier information from both the `Enter` key and the arrow keys, making a code-only fix for a `Shift+Key` newline combination unfeasible on this specific platform, although i think this might work on other platforms which by default register shift + down as '\\x1b[1;2B' but i cant really test it.\n\nThis might explain why `Ctrl+J` is a common suggested alternative, as it sends a universal newline character (`\\n`) that doesn't rely on modifier key parsing.\n\nAs this is my first contribution, my analysis could be wrong, and I apologize for the detailed-but-failed attempt. Given these findings, what is the desired path forward? Any information from the internal `b.corp.google.com` link about how other terminals are supported would still be very helpful.\n\nThank you for your time and guidance.", "Just to add, I personally use the Warp Terminal on Mac.

If you are planing on helping out will multiple sections, then submit 1 or 2, and I will review them and then you can do more. Because the rst2myst does make mistakes, the reviewer(probably me) needs to click on every link and check carefully line by line.  \n\nJust add a comment to what section you are working on. \n\nAn unfortunate downside is that the git blame will be reset for the docs files. \n\nThe index.rst file needs to be the last file converted since I cannot figure out to have rst files and a md file as the index.  See [myst docs](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/syntax/roles-and-directives.html#roles-directivesl) for how to use myst with sphinx roles.

A机房部署thanos，采样之后保存历史数据。\r\n  - B机房部署VictoriaMetrics，提供3个月原始数据。\r\n  - C机房部署Prometheus，量比较小。\r\n\r\n  - 使用了telegraf采集基础监控，业务监控暂时通过falcon的/v1/push接口转发至n9e,后期下掉falcon由sdk直接上报。\r\n  - telegraf加壳部署为n9e-agent,每个机器都往各自机房server写数据。\r\n  - A,B机房的数据双写(集群：Default)，读写地址是通过srv域名做的区域解析。A区的server读自己的TSDB(thanos)，B区的server读(B机房部署VictoriaMetrics，提供3个月原始数据)。\r\n\r\n- TSDB:\r\n  - 时序存储测试了thanos,VictoriaMetrics,m3db。m3db因资源占用太高被下掉了。\r\n  - m3db: m3 Coordinator节点经常oom,扩容到5台*256G的内存都不行，换了vm 5台128G的机器还有50%空闲。\r\n  - thanos: 用的Receive模式，保存3个月原始数据，历史数据会采样之后上传到oss,压力主要在receive服务。\r\n    > thanos有个问题：query无法按时间就近查询receive,而是查询所有store地址然后合并数据(是否我的用法不当)？假如receive存7天数据，store存30天数据，我只想查最近7天的数据，他会同时查询receive和store,因为store数据可能保存在oss所以会很慢。为了解决查询速度慢的问题，加了query-frontend,store地址也合并为1个lb地址，初次查询会慢，后面就走缓存了。\r\n  - VictoriaMetrics：vm我测试下来挺满意的，目前用了8台机器，总体资源使用不足40%。\r\n\r\n- 需求建议：可以更易用，当然这个是大家共同探索的方向。\r\n", "@bbaobelief 请教几个问题\r\n1、业务监控暂时通过falcon的/v1/push接口转发至n9e(将原来agent推送到transfer的压力都转发到n9e,为什么不考虑直接推送到vm或者Prometheus).后期下掉falcon由sdk直接上报(这块agent聚合能力放到sdk去处理吗？还是采取一分钟推送一次？感觉这块逻辑放到sdk是否会影响原来应用的资源使用)\r\n2、之前falcon的nodata处理你们有遇到这块的问题嘛？", "> @bbaobelief 请教几个问题 1、业务监控暂时通过falcon的/v1/push接口转发至n9e(将原来agent推送到transfer的压力都转发到n9e,为什么不考虑直接推送到vm或者Prometheus).后期下掉falcon由sdk直接上报(这块agent聚合能力放到sdk去处理吗？还是采取一分钟推送一次？感觉这块逻辑放到sdk是否会影响原来应用的资源使用) 2、之前falcon的nodata处理你们有遇到这块的问题嘛？\r\n\r\n- 问题 1\r\n  - 写n9e-server是为了配置多个远程写，还有n9e-server有ident注册逻辑，自动按业务组打标签功能。目前观察n9e-server没啥压力。\r\n  - 我们现有的框架sdk是计算好之后1分钟上报一次falcon,为了n9e能快速上线，减少业务代码改动，用了falcon-agent转发n9e-server。\r\n- 问题 2\r\n  - nodata目前没有太好的方案。对于一些精确labels使用了`absent_over_time `函数告警。", "- 企业或者组织: 方正证券\r\n- 地点：北京\r\n- 使用场景和经验分享：\r\n- 最看重夜莺的哪些功能：\r\n\t* 云原生监控，无缝对接Prometheus的能力，支持多种、多个数据源\r\n\t* 开源、活跃的社区、有问必答的专业监控咨询，构建了一个比较好的监控生态圈，能放心使用\r\n\t* 从Open-Falcon到夜莺，监控组件一直很稳定\r\n\t* 更有效的告警策略配置\r\n\t* 完善的监控数据查询、监控大盘构建能力\r\n\t* 按业务线进行读、写权限控制\r\n- 使用规模和范围：\r\n\t* 测试环境监控对象接入1500+,生产环境监控对象接入近6000台\r\n\t* 测试环境监控策略700+项,生产环境监控策略3300+项\r\n- 架构：目前是在同时使用Open-falcon和夜莺监控系统\r\n    * 6机房，保留Open-falcon监控系统：Transfer组件转发到中心Transfer\r\n    * 主机房夜莺server、webapi按官方推荐，根据需求多节点部署\r\n    * agent：历史监控一直使用Open-falcon，涉及agent较多，且falcon-agent的适配和稳定性较好，采用夜莺facon push接口，进行数据同步；K8S使用grafana-agent采集；telegraf根据需求进行部署，进一步推广\r\n    * 监控数据：中心Transfer 同步到夜莺；默认采用Prometheus TSDB，接入多个研发、运维的Prometheus数据源；VictoriaMetrics作为长期存储\r\n- 需求建议：\r\n\t * 管控能力，更少的人管理更多的监控\r\n\t * 更容易上手，降低研发、运维等使用门槛\r\n\t * agent管理：状态、部署、更新、命令下发等能力\r\n\t * 插件或工具的管理及流程化\r\n\r\n最后特别感谢夜莺监控团队对监控领域的辛勤付出和耐心解答！", "> \r\n\r\n企业或者组织: 深圳艾派\r\n地点：西安\r\n使用场景：可视化监控报警配置\r\n需求建议：app或者小程序", "企业或者组织: 人人公司\r\n地点：北京\r\n使用场景：可视化监控报警配置，日志监控，对接K8S ，做多集群prometheus 存储\r\n需求建议：日志mtail 本身是日志告警的，有个组件叫loggie ，做日志告警以及日志收集，看是否可以整合，两个开源团队能否碰触火花", "企业或者组织: 诺瓦星云科技股份有限公司\r\n地点：西安\r\n使用场景：主要是监控VMware云的虚机，做可视化监控报警配置，应用日志监控，多集群prometheus 存储。\r\n需求建议：可一边使用快捷查询，一边可提示语法方式制作、测试监控模板。碰到过好多，告警模板制作好了，许久没有告警。\r\n\r\n最重要的是，作为一个监控系统，虽然不做大而全，但至少能提供一个批量处理集群的命令执行工具。比如ansible能集成就好了。\r\n\r\n祝发展越来越好。", "- 企业或者组织: 路特斯\r\n- 地点：武汉\r\n- 使用场景和经验分享：\r\n- 最看重夜莺的哪些功能：\r\n  -

The expected behavior is for the cmdlet to obtain an access token for the specified resource URI. However, when signing in with `-AccessToken`, there's no refresh token, meaning that unless the provided URI is an exact match, it cannot acquire a new token. This behavior is by design, but the team should guide customers to use `-ResourceTypeName` for well-known resources, as it provides superior accessibility.",

(need action1 done)\n\nMove the connector creation logic from `Connector` to `ConnectorFactory`.\n\n\nThe benefits:\n- Know the relationship between parameters. Use the `optionRule` check the config before create connector instance.\n- This can be used in SeaTunnelWeb.\n\n\nWelcome to do this with me\n\n### Task list\n\n\n| type       |

accomplish?\n\n- List and describe the connector parameters in the `Factory.optionRule()` method.\nWhile doing so, we can move all parameters into the XXXXOptions class to unify the code style and centralize the parameters into a single file.\n\n- Move the connector creation logic into `Factory.createSource/createSink`.\nImplement the `createSource/createSink` methods in Factory and instantiate the corresponding connector.\n\n\n\n### Are you willing to submit PR?\n\n- [x] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!",

What it would be look like?\n\nAbout proposal2\nnow some connector implement the `TableSourceFactory`, but they not implement `createSource` method. so we still has 2 way to create the `Connector` instance.\n- one is use `tableSourceFactory.createSource/Sink()` it return the connector instance.\n- one is use `ServiceLoader.load` to load all implement and use `pluginIdentifier` to find the connector instance.\n\nSo I suggest we unified the behavior, implement the `createSource/Sink` method. use `Factory` to create the connector instance. \n\n\n```\n    private static boolean isFallback(Optional<Factory> factory) {\n        if (!factory.isPresent()) {\n            return true;\n        }\n        try {\n            ((TableSourceFactory) factory.get()).createSource(null);\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            if (e instanceof UnsupportedOperationException\n                    && \"The Factory has not been implemented and the deprecated Plugin will be used.\"\n                            .equals(e.getMessage())) {\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n```\n", "Oh I got it.

However, the tagify package also provides a [source SCSS file](https://github.com/yairEO/tagify/blob/v4.22.2/src/tagify.scss). It would be interesting to use the SCSS file instead and adapt the styling to our new website design.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Solution\r\n1. Use tagifies' SCSS file as a modifiable base instead of the pre-built CSS file\r\n1. Update the styling to match our new website design.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n- Consistent styling with our website design.\r\n- Easier maintenance and customization using SCSS.\r\n\r\n### Implementation Steps\r\n1. Create a new SCSS file, which included the tagify SCSS file.\r\n1. Use that SCSS file instead of the CSS file in Gulp, so it's copied to `css/dist/tagify.css` during build\r\n1. Update the styling as needed.\r\n\r\n### Additional Notes\r\n- Ensure compatibility with other components and styles in our project.",

E.g. something like this:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c57ce22c-b91e-4a5c-822c-efdcb3ed065c)\n\n### How?\n\nAdd `border=True|False` (defaulting to True) to `st.table`. If set to `False`, all borders should be invisible. \n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_",

It draws a straight line between the cursor position last time the lasso was removed and when it's now restored, allowing the user to also use this as a technique for drawing straight line sections of the lasso, but also just to decide to use box selection instead of lasso at any time.\n- Ctrl+dragging an *object* currently drags its layer(s) but we want to make it instead always lasso select. This lets the user perform a lasso selection over an existing layer, or a box selection but releasing Ctrl as in the previous bullet point.\n- Lasso selection has a bug that should be fixed: aborting the lasso selection (RMB or Esc) then creating a new lasso selection ends up erroneously extending the previously drawn lasso path because abort fails to clear the lasso data (which also wastes memory!).

If anyone is motivated, they can dive into the topic and implement some interesting randomized algorithms.\n\n\n\n\n### Issue details\n\nAs examples, i could consider algorithms like:\n\n- [ ] Randomized Closest Pair Algorithm\n\n- [x] Randomized Quicksort [solved by @VibhuKhera123 #6234 ] \n\n- [ ] Randomized Matrix Multiplication Verification, if A* B = C\n\nAnd many others...\n\n### Additional Information\n\n\nThese algorithms are a bit harder to test due to their inherent randomness, but they offer a great opportunity to expand the variety of algorithms in the repository and explore different problem-solving approaches.\n\nIf you're interested, feel free to start exploring and contribute! Any contributions would be highly appreciated.",

Here’s my high-level plan:\n\n1. **Interface scaffolding**  \n   - Pull the exact `NFTContractInterface`, `JobContractInterface`, etc. from Issues #440 & #441.  \n   - Generate TS stubs for each contract method & event signature.\n\n2. **Mock implementations**  \n   - For each contract interface, create a `MockXyzContract` class that simulates state in-memory (e.g. `Map<…>`).  \n   - Implement all methods with realistic return types, incrementing IDs or toggling states as needed.  \n   - Include optional IPFS-style metadata where applicable.\n\n3. **Configurable delays & errors**  \n   - Add a shared `MockConfig` where teams can set per-contract or per-method delays (in ms) and error rates.  \n   - Wrap methods in a helper that injects `await sleep(config.delay)` and randomly throws when `config.errorRate > 0`.\n\n4. **Dockerized local server**  \n   - Spin up an Express (or Fastify) HTTP+JSON-RPC server exposing each mock contract under distinct endpoints (e.g. `/mock/nft/mint`).  \n   - Write a `Dockerfile` that installs dependencies, builds TS, and starts the mock server.  \n   - Expose ports & volume-mount docs for easy local use.\n\n5. **Documentation & examples**  \n   - Add a `README.md` with:\n     - Installation via `docker build` + `docker run`\n     - Environment variables or JSON config format\n     - Sample TS code showing how to `import { MockNFTContract }` or call the Docker-based RPC.  \n   - Provide a small `example/` folder with a Next.js or Node script that mints a token, polls for events, and demonstrates error injection.\n\n6. **Testing**  \n   - Write unit tests (Jest) to assert that each mock follows its interface and respects delays/errors.  \n   - Add a CI step in `mock/` that runs these tests.\n\nI’ll follow the project’s CONTRIBUTING guidelines, commit under a branch named `mock-contracts-setup`, and open a draft PR once I’ve scaffolded the first two mocks. Please assign this issue to me or let me know if there’s any other setup I should follow first.

Would it be helpful for me to reproduce the panic using the provided YAML and test @orfeas-k’s potential fix, focusing on validating the new error message?\n2. Should I propose a test case in the KServe test suite (e.g., under test/) to ensure the controller rejects invalid configurations with a clear, actionable error?\n3. Are there preferred validation patterns or error message formats for the fix in hpa_reconciler.go?\n4. How can I best coordinate with @orfeas-k to assist with implementation or testing without overlapping efforts?\n\nI’ve set up a KServe development environment with Kubernetes and am prepared to reproduce the issue, test proposed fixes, or contribute validation logic. Any guidance on next steps or specific areas where I can add value would be appreciated. Thank you for supporting contributions to KServe!" ],

We can see [here](https://github.com/fjall-rs/lsm-tree/blob/main/src/blob_tree/mod.rs#L562) that the `BlobTree::disk_usage()` considers both the size of the index (keys) & blobs (values).\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n1. In the [rolling-log](https://github.com/fjall-rs/fjall/blob/main/examples/rolling-log/src/main.rs) example, enable kv separation & change inserted value to `[0; 1024]`\n2. Run the example & watch it crash on the assert after 5 steps.\n\n**Expected behavior**\nThe partition should be compacted as per the docs.\n\n**Additional context**\nI'm using fjall, not this crate directly. But since `Fifo` is defined in this crate, I'm opening this issue here.\n",

Run `youtube-dl --version` and ensure your version is 2021.12.17. If it's not, see https://yt-dl.org/update on how to update. Issues with outdated version will be REJECTED.\r\n- Search the bugtracker for similar site feature requests: http://yt-dl.org/search-issues. DO NOT post duplicates.\r\n- Finally, put x into all relevant boxes (like this [x])\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] I'm reporting a site feature request\r\n- [x] I've verified that I'm running youtube-dl version **2021.12.17**\r\n- [x] I've searched the bugtracker for similar site feature requests including closed ones\r\n\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nProvide an explanation of your site feature request in an arbitrary form. Please make sure the description is worded well enough to be understood, see https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl#is-the-description-of-the-issue-itself-sufficient. Provide any additional information, suggested solution and as much context and examples as possible.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWith the latest google search versions, one can look up \"NFL\" (for example), and the schedules, players and teams pop-up as well as (and this is what I'm suggesting to implement) previews or highlights. When trying to download them from the Google page, it does not recognizes it, the user needs to get into the actual video (youtube in most cases) to get it. Implementing this would mean much faster access to videos and the users not having to navigate several layers of webpages to download them.\r\nI tried creating a general \"google extractor\" but couldn't manage to do it. Other option I thought about but could not put into practice was to handle that webpage forwarding (google search -> youtube) within the program\r\n",

Check out yt-dl and yt-dlp, load the yt-dlp extractor into the editor and load the yt-dl extractor into the right-hand pane. Then you can go through the differences and decide whether the yt-dlp change should applied directly, modified or ignored. Some changes will be specific to yt-dlp and need to be adapted so as to run on both Python 2 and 3. For example, the linked commit includes these lines that will fail in Python 2 \r\n```\r\n                'http://www.google.com/search', f'gvsearch:{query}',\r\n                note=f'Downloading result page {pagenum + 1}',\r\n```\r\nYou'll need to change this in some way, say:\r\n```\r\n                'http://www.google.com/search', 'gvsearch:' + query,\r\n                note='Downloading result page %d' % (pagenum + 1, ),\r\n```\r\n\r\nSome IDE plug-in or judicious use of _vi_ and _diff_ could achieve the same result.\r\n\r\nIf there is a specific change, a commit or set of commits, that should be applied, you can use _git_ magic to apply such commits while preserving the commit details. In GH you can add `.patch` to commit and PR URLs to generate a patch file that you can pass to the `git am` command: to make the patch applicable you first have to edit it to replace the `yt_dlp/` in pathnames with `youtube_dl/`. After applying the patch to your branch you can make any additional changes in your own subsequent commit. Eventually when this gets merged we would probably `squash` the commits in the PR so that the resulting commit appears as `Co-authored by:` all the people whose commits are included.\r\n\r\nAs above, test the modified extractor in your patch branch (there's a small test in the linked commit). Then push the branch to your yt-dl fork. You should be able to enable the server-side tests that ensure your changes work in a variety of supported environments.

However, the `ccusage blocks --live` monitor in the terminal shows the session ending at a different time (8 PM in the attached screenshot).\n\nThis difference can be a bit confusing as it's not clear which timer to follow. Could you please clarify if this is the expected behavior?\n\n#### **Steps to Observe the Behavior**\n1. On macOS with the latest version of VS Code.\n2. Have the Claude Code extension installed.\n3. In the VS Code integrated terminal, run the command `ccusage@latest blocks --live`.\n4. The time displayed by the extension in the editor's top bar (\"resets at 6pm\") differs from the \"Remaining\" time in the `ccusage` monitor (e.g., shows end time of 8:00:00 PM).\n\n#### **My Expectation**\nFor clarity, I would expect both timers to be synchronized and reflect the actual session end time.\n\n#### **Screenshots**\nAs shown in the screenshot, the top right of the IDE indicates a reset time of 6 PM, while the `ccusage` session monitor in the terminal shows a session end time of 8 PM.\n\n#### **Environment**\n* **OS:** macOS\n* **IDE:** Visual Studio Code (Latest Version)\n* **Tool:** `ccusage@latest`\n* **Extension Name & Version:** Claude Code `[Please add extension version if known]`\n\nThank you for looking into this.　",

Key considerations include:\r\n- Allowing the user to cancel the pop-up screen so they do not get the notification again (at least on the current installation!)\r\n- Pop-up appearing after approx 5-7 sessions\r\n- Making it easy to provide feedback, e.g. a rating scale for a particular feature, with supporting text field for additional details",

Hope that helps clarify...", "I'm going to start working on this issue!", "I started working on this issue by creating a new Helper file similar to AppShareHelper and AppReviewHelper which handle the pop-ups for sharing or reviewing the app. I was wondering what would be the best way to store user responses? Is there some sort of API to use to receive the responses? Or should I use GDATelemetry? I noticed it says it's a stub, but still seems to be used.", "There's not currently any mechanism for receiving  user data. The `GDATelemetry` subsystem was not included in the open-source release provided by Microsoft, and we never hooked up a replacement, so all the references you see to it in the code are no-ops. Getting a working telemetry system would be a nice project on its own, though at the same time I'm quite happy not having us handling any user-provided data and the security/privacy implications that come with that.\n\nAs for the feature at issue here, the current feedback link just opens a new email message in the user's email program. Keeping this as the mechanism could be fine for a first pass while we're focusing on improving the UX of when/how the prompt gets shown." ],
