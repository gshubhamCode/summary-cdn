Those marked as \"help needed!\" require a native speaker to review the associated PRs and suggest any corrections.  \n\nChanges can be made by starting a Github code review and suggesting changes, or alternative by adding comments to the PR.\n\nTesting of the changes is not required, but if you wish to do so there are instructions below. \n\n### Add Additional Languages\n\nIf you wish to add support for an additional language, either create a new PR for that language or reply to this issue requesting a new PR containing machine generated translation for that language, which you can then review.\n\nNote that right-to-left (RTL) languages are not currently supported.\n\n## Locale Support\n\n| Language | Code | Status | Reviewers | Review Date | PR |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| English | `en` | merged | @fujiapple852 | 2024-09-28 | #1321  |\n| French | `fr` | merged | @zarkdav | 2024-09-30 | #1322 |\n| Turkish | `tr` |  merged | @orhun, @arda-guler | 2024-10-04 | #1330 |\n| Chinese | `zh` | merged | @sxyazi | 2024-10-18 | #1333 |\n| Chinese (Taiwan) | `zh-TW` | merged | @shyuan | 2025-08-01 | #1630 |\n| Portuguese | `pt` | merged | @ulissesf | 2024-10-18 | #1334 |\n| Swedish | `sv` | merged | @0323pin | 2024-11-02 | #1354 |\n| Italian | `it` | merged | @ricott1 | 2024-10-17 | #1355 |\n| Russian | `ru` | merged | @histrio | 2024-11-04 | #1345 |\n| Spanish | `es` | merged | @josueBarretogit | 2024-11-05 | #1325 |\n| German | `de` | merged | @peshay | 2024-11-08 | #1331 |\n| Hindi | `hi` | in progress | @kiranyele18 | | #1343 |\n| Dutch | `nl` | awaiting review | Help needed! | | #1332 |\n| Korean  | `ko` | awaiting review | Help needed! | | #1335 |\n| Japanese  | `jp` | awaiting review | Help needed! | | #1342 |\n| ~~Arabic~~ | `ar` | cancelled (RTL) | @tsallabi | 25-01-2025 | #1344 |\n\nAdditional locales not on this list are also welcome.\n\n## Language and Region\n\nLocales can be specified for a language or a language and a region.  For example, a general locale can be created for `zh` (Chinese) and a more specific locales such as `zh-CN` (China) and `zh-HK` (Hong Kong) can be created.\n\nIf the users chosen full locale (`langauge-region`) does not exist, then Trippy will fallback to using the locale for the language  only, if it exists.  For example, if the user sets a locale of `zh-TW` (which, assume, does not have a locale defined in Trippy) it will fallback to using the `zh` locale if it is defined.\n\nLocales should generally be added to Trippy for the language only, except where it makes sense to have different translations per region as well.\n\n## Fallback\n\nIf the users chosen locale does not exists in Trippy it will fallback to `en` (English).  Fallback is per word/phrase in the locale, and so it is possible to have a locale defined with only a subset of words/phrases, with the remainder falling back to `en`.\n\n## Testing\n\nIf you wish to see how the translations look and feel for a given locale you can checkout the PRs linked above (where `xx` is the locale code):\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy.git\ngit checkout feat-i18n-xx\ncargo build\n```\n\nThen run Trippy with the `--tui-locale xx` option (where `xx` is the locale code):\n\n```shell\nsudo ./target/debug/trip --tui-locale xx example.com\n```\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [x] #1319\n- [x] #1336\n- [x] #1337",

Trippy uses the https://github.com/1Password/sys-locale library to get the system locale in platform specific ways. Trippy simply calls `sys_locale::get_locale()` which returns the \"the most preferred locale\" on the system.\n\nAre you able to confirm what calling `sys_locale::get_locale()` reports on your system?" ],

However, on mobile devices, the link tries to open inside Owncast's embedded viewer. As a result, the page doesn't load properly (only a broken document icon or a blank screen is displayed).\r\n\r\nIt's worth noting that setting the link to open in the same window doesn???t work either.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to force these kinds of links to always open in a new tab or external window, especially on mobile?\r\n\r\nI remain attentive and grateful for any recommendation or future improvement regarding this matter.\r\n\r\nKind regards,</div>",

      "comments" : [ "## Good First Issue\n\n This item was marked as a good first issue because of the following:\n\n - It's self contained as a single feature or change.\n - Is clear when it's complete.\n - You do not need deep knowledge of Owncast to accomplish it.\n\n\n ### Next Steps\n\n 1. Comment on this issue before starting work so it can be assigned to you. Also, this issue may have been filed with limited detail or changes may have occurred that are worth sharing with you before you start work.\n 2. Drop by our [community chat](https://owncast.rocket.chat/) if you'd like to be involved in more real-time discussion around Owncast to talk about this change.\n 3. Follow the project's getting started tips to make sure you can [build and run the project from source](https://owncast.online/development).\n\n ### Notes\n\n - Development takes place on the `develop` branch.\n - We use Storybook for testing and developing React components. `npm run storybook`. A hosted version [is available for viewing](https://owncast.online/components).\n - If you need to install the Go programming language to run the Owncast backend it's simple from [here](https://go.dev/dl/).\n - Active contributors get an Owncast t-shirt! Ask about it if you feel like you've been contributing and haven't yet been given one.\n\n ### New to Git?\n\n If you're brand new to Git you may want a short primer about the Fork -> Commit -> Pull Request workflow that enables changes to get made collaboratively using git. Visit the [First Contributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) project to learn step-by-step how to commit a change to a Git repository such as this one." ],

      "comments" : [ "# :wave: Important: PLEASE READ :wave:\n\nThis issue has been labeled as a **good first issue** and is available for anyone to work on.\n\nIf this is your first time contributing to an open source project, some aspects of the development process may seem unusual, arcane, or some combination of both.\n\n1.  **You cannot \"claim\" issues.** People new to open source often want to \"claim\" or be assigned an issue before beginning work. The typical rationale is that people want to avoid wasted work in the event that someone else ends up working the issue. However, this practice is not effective in open source, as it often leads to \"issue squatting\", in which an individual asks to be assigned, is granted their request, and then never ends up working on the issue. Accordingly, you are encouraged to communicate your intent to address this issue, ideally by providing a rough outline as to how you plan to address the issue or asking clarifying questions, but, at the end of the day, we will take running code and rough consensus in order to move forward quickly.\n2.  **We have a very high bar for contributions.** We have very high standards for contributions and expect all contributions???whether new features, tests, or documentation???to be rigorous, thorough, and complete. Once a pull request is merged into stdlib, that contribution immediately becomes the collective responsibility of all maintainers of stdlib. When we merge code into stdlib, we are saying that we, the maintainers, commit to reviewing subsequent changes and making bugfixes to the code. Hence, in order to ensure future maintainability, this naturally leads to a higher standard of contribution.\n\nBefore working on this issue and opening a pull request, please read the project's [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md). These guidelines and the associated [development guide](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/docs/contributing/development.md) provide important information, including links to stdlib's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), license policy, and steps for setting up your local development environment.\n\nTo reiterate, we **strongly** encourage you to refer to our contributing guides **before** beginning work on this issue. Failure to follow our guidelines significantly decreases the likelihood that you'll successfully contribute to stdlib and may result in automatic closure of a pull request without review.\n\nSetting up your local development environment is a critical first step, as doing so ensures that automated development processes for linting, license verification, and unit testing can run prior to authoring commits and pushing changes. If you would prefer to avoid manual setup, we provide pre-configured [development containers](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/tree/develop/.devcontainer) for use locally or in GitHub Codespaces.\n\nWe place a high value on consistency throughout the stdlib codebase. We encourage you to closely examine other packages in stdlib and attempt to emulate the practices and conventions found therein.\n\n-   If you are attempting to contribute a new package, sometimes the best approach is to simply copy the contents of an existing package and then modify the minimum amount necessary to implement the feature (e.g., changing descriptions, parameter names, and implementation).\n-   If you are contributing tests, find a package implementing a similar feature and emulate the tests of that package.\n-   If you are updating documentation, examine several similar packages and emulate the content, style, and prose of those packages.\n\nIn short, the more effort you put in to ensure that your contribution looks and feels like stdlib???including variables names, bracket spacing, line breaks, etc???the more likely that your contribution will be reviewed and ultimately accepted. We encourage you to closely study the codebase **before** beginning work on this issue.\n\n:sparkles: Thank you again for your interest in stdlib, and we look forward to reviewing your future contributions. :sparkles:\n" ],

      "description" : "### Problem Description\n\nAs discussed in https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish/pull/25641#discussion_r2241742870, the installation guide lists supported Jakarta EE APIs and internal components. We'd like to publish versions of these APIs and components and keep them updated based on the real versions of dependencies defined in GlassFish Maven build.\n\nThe versions of artifacts are already defined as Maven properties in the parent pom.xml. However, they contain period (such as derby.version) and Asciidoc doesn't support that. We need to redeclare them as properties without periods (such as derbyVersion)\n\nSo, this would work:\n* in the parent docs pom, in the [properties section](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish/blob/dd452d0fb6687fd29df69b6da95141acdd097ab2/docs/parent/pom.xml#L31), redefine each property we need without a period - if we need derby.version, we need to redefine it as `<derbyVersion>${derby.version}</derbyVersion>`\n* replace references to versions in the adoc files, mainly in the [Security guide](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish/blob/master/docs/installation-guide/src/main/asciidoc/installing.adoc) with references to variables without periods, e.g. {derbyVersion}\n\nAdditionally, we could add other components used by GlassFish, which are not yet referenced in the Installation guide.\n\n### Impact of Issue\n\nThe documentation would be kept automatically up to date with changes in component versions.",

You can see examples of this in [this pull request] and [this one]\n\n- Benchmarking your new pass: To run benchmarks on your new pass, please refer to the [tutorial and documentation] on using ucc-bench\n\n\nThe URLs are missing so I would add them later once you approve this .", "> Cool!\n> \n> So all the UCC docs source code is located in the repo at: [ucc/docs/source](https://github.com/unitaryfoundation/ucc/tree/main/docs/source).

One more to thing to add here is to have an ideal pass example that contributors can refer to while coming up with ideas for new passes .

      "description" : "### \uD83D\uDD27 Chore Summary\n\nCreate a script that automatically checks and optionally adds or fixes relative file path headers in source files. Each Python file should contain a standardized header with its relative path location for improved navigation and documentation consistency.\n\n---\n\n### \uD83E\uDDF1 Area Affected\n\nChoose the general area(s) that this chore affects:\n\n- [x] Pre-commit hooks / linters\n- [x] Formatting (black, isort, ruff, etc.)\n- [x] Build system or `Makefile`\n- [x] Docs or spellcheck\n\n---\n\n### ?????? Context / Rationale\n\nCurrently, source files lack consistent location headers, making it difficult to:\n- Navigate large codebases efficiently\n- Understand file organization when viewing individual files\n- Maintain documentation consistency across the project\n- Quickly identify file locations during code reviews\n\nThis script will standardize headers across all Python files with the format:\n```python\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n\"\"\"Module Description.\nLocation: ./relative/path/to/file.py\n\nCopyright 2025\nSPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0\nAuthors: Mihai Criveti\n\nModule documentation...\n\"\"\"\n```\n\nThis reduces tech debt and improves developer experience by providing consistent file location context.\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDCE6 Related Make Targets\n\nReference any relevant Makefile targets that are involved, if applicable:\n\n- `make lint` - run ruff, mypy, flake8, etc. (should pass after header updates)\n- `make pre-commit` - run pre-configured hooks (may need to handle new headers)\n- `make check-headers` - new target to validate file headers using `.github/tools/fix_file_headers.py --check`\n- `make fix-headers` - new target to automatically fix missing/incorrect headers using `.github/tools/fix_file_headers.py --fix-all`\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDCCB Acceptance Criteria\n\nDefine what \"done\" looks like for this task.\n\n**Script Requirements:**\n- [ ] Script implemented at `.github/tools/fix_file_headers.py`\n- [ ] Script can scan all Python files in the project\n- [ ] Script can detect missing or incorrect relative path headers\n- [ ] Script provides interactive mode to review and approve changes\n- [ ] Script provides batch mode for automated fixes\n- [ ] Script preserves existing docstring content while updating location\n- [ ] Script handles edge cases (files without docstrings, existing headers, etc.)\n\n**Implementation Requirements:**\n- [ ] Script follows the standardized header format shown in example\n- [ ] All Python files have correct relative path headers after running\n- [ ] Headers maintain consistent formatting and structure\n- [ ] Copyright and license information is preserved/added consistently\n\n**Quality Checks:**\n- [ ] Linter runs cleanly (`make lint`)\n- [ ] CI passes with no regressions\n- [ ] No existing functionality is broken\n- [ ] Script can be integrated into pre-commit hooks (optional)\n\n**Documentation:**\n- [ ] Script usage is documented with examples\n- [ ] Makefile targets are added for header management\n- [ ] Header format is documented for future reference\n\n---\n\n### \uD83E\uDDE9 Additional Notes\n\n**Technical Implementation Notes:**\n- Script should be placed in `.github/tools/fix_file_headers.py`\n- Use Python's `ast` module to safely parse and modify Python files\n- Preserve original file encodings and line endings\n- Handle files that already have partial headers gracefully\n- Consider using `pathlib` for cross-platform path handling\n\n**File Selection Criteria:**\n- Target `.py` files in project directories\n- Exclude virtual environments, build directories, and `.git`\n- Focus on source code files (`mcpgateway/`, `tests/`, etc.)\n\n**Header Template Variables:**\n- `Location`: Relative path from project root (e.g., `./mcpgateway/services/gateway_service.py`)\n- `Copyright`: Current year (2025)\n- `Authors`: Configurable, default to \"Mihai Criveti\"\n- `License`: Apache-2.0 (consistent with project)\n\n**Integration Considerations:**\n- Script should be idempotent (safe to run multiple times)\n- Consider adding to pre-commit hooks for new files\n- May need to update existing CI/CD checks that parse file headers\n- Ensure script works with different Python file structures (modules, packages, scripts)\n\n**Example Command Usage:**\n```bash\n# Check which files need header updates (dry-run)\npython .github/tools/fix_file_headers.py --check\n\n# Interactively review and apply changes\npython .github/tools/fix_file_headers.py --interactive\n\n# Automatically fix all files (batch mode)\npython .github/tools/fix_file_headers.py --fix-all\n\n# Fix specific directory\npython .github/tools/fix_file_headers.py --fix --path mcpgateway/services/\n```",

The above-mentioned `gradle-modules-plugin` might be a way, however, we don't currently have the time to look into this due to limited resources.

You can try to modify the Windows-specific tasks `createMsi`, `createExe`, and `createWindowsPortableZip` in `build.gradle.kts` influence the `CLASSPATH` according to your needs to fix this issue.

I usually use pnpm but to simplify the thing, I used npm. By the way the [Using styled-components](https://mui.com/material-ui/integrations/styled-components/#with-npm) is not accurate when you work with Vite + Vitest, you must also override styled-engine in the package.json otherwise vitest resolves styled-engine instead of styled-engine-sc.\n\nThere is a workaround to make it work. You need to add the `fallbackCJS` this in your vite.config.ts:\n\n```typescript\nimport { defineConfig } from \"vite\";\nimport react from \"@vitejs/plugin-react\";\nimport tsconfigPaths from \"vite-tsconfig-paths\";\n\n// https://vite.dev/config/\nexport default defineConfig({\n  test: {\n    environment: \"jsdom\",\n    globals: true,\n    // #region Uncomment this code to work with Mui v7+\n    server: {\n      deps: {\n        fallbackCJS: true,\n      },\n    },\n    // #endregion\n  },\n  plugins: [react(), tsconfigPaths()],\n});\n```\n\nI also have a premium license, I don't know if it's required for the mui support.\n\nThank you!\n\n### Your environment\n\n<details>\n  <summary><code>npx @mui/envinfo</code></summary>\n\n```\nSystem:\n    OS: macOS 14.1.1\n  Binaries:\n    Node: 22.16.0 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v22.16.0/bin/node\n    npm: 10.9.2 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v22.16.0/bin/npm\n    pnpm: 9.9.0 - ~/Library/pnpm/pnpm\n  Browsers:\n    Chrome: 138.0.7204.158\n    Edge: Not Found\n    Safari: 17.1\n  npmPackages:\n    @mui/core-downloads-tracker:  7.2.0 \n    @mui/material: ^7.2.0 => 7.2.0 \n    @mui/private-theming:  7.2.0 \n    @mui/styled-engine-sc:  7.2.0 \n    @mui/system:  7.2.0 \n    @mui/types:  7.4.4 \n    @mui/utils:  7.2.0 \n    @types/react: ^19.1.8 => 19.1.8 \n    react: ^19.1.0 => 19.1.0 \n    react-dom: ^19.1.0 => 19.1.0 \n    styled-components: ^6.1.19 => 6.1.19 \n    typescript: ~5.8.3 => 5.8.3 \n```\n</details>\n\n\n**Search keywords**: vitest mui7 styled-components",

Can only set one of the following keys: text, image, document, video, toolUse, toolResult, guardContent, reasoningContent.\n```\n\nWith all that said, we did not correctly define the type on our end.

Please describe.\n\nAs a user of CUB and NVRTC, it is easy to mistakenly include the `<cub/cub.cuh>` header instead of the more specific header like `<cub/block/block_reduce.cuh>`. [Improved documentation](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cccl/issues/5404) would help with this, but a safety net that just detects it and tells me what to do instead would be better. \n\nThe latter will succeed as we explicitly test and support CUB block/warp primitives within CUDA C++ kernels compiled with NVRTC. \n\nThe former will fail since `cub.cuh` contains host code and NVRTC can only compile device code. \n\nThe failure mode when this happens can be confusing because you're likely to get an error like this:\n```\nnvrtc_cli fatal   : nvrtcCompileProgram failed: NVRTC_ERROR_COMPILATION\n/opt/compiler-explorer/libs/cccl/v3.0.0/thrust/thrust/system/cuda/detail/core/triple_chevron_launch.h(61): error: A function explicitly marked as a __host__ function is not allowed in JIT mode\n    THRUST_RUNTIME_FUNCTION triple_chevron(\n```\n\nIt would be far more helpful to get an error saying that this header isn't supported with NVRTC and point people to what _is_ supported. \n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nThe `cub.cuh` header (and any other public header that doesn't support NVRTC) should `#error` with an informative diagnostic when it detects compilation with NVRTC. \n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

It is clear that many contributors are not reading the contributing.MD or the documentation update readme. \n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nWe are a welcoming community and we would like to include all regardless of their learning methodology. Some read, others watch. So, we would like a video to welcome contributors and walk them through the basics of contributing to KubeStellar. Once completed, we can create a shortcut url and give it to anyone with a question about making a contribution. This saves everyone time.\n\n### Are you willing to contribute?\n\n- [ ] Yes, I'd like to help implement this feature.\n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_",

This might include cleaning up integration specific settings on the 3rd party platform. Users would have the ability to specify if this should be done - we dont want to do this by default. This should be doable from the platform and the CLI.\n\n## Solution\n\n**API:**\n- Add a `abstract destroy(eventId: Event['id'])` function to `base.integration.ts`\n- Write implementation of this function across the various integrations\n- Accept an optional query parameter `cleanUp` in `DELETE /api/integration/:slug` endpoint\n- Update the service layer to call `integrationObject.destroy()` if `cleanUp` is set to true\n- Delete `KS_PRIVATE_KEY` from the hosted app if its a platform integration\n\n**CLI:**\n- We should be able to issue a command like `keyshade integration delete <slug> --clean-up` that will delete the integration data.\n\n**Platform:**\n- There should be a checkbox in `Delete Integration` dialog that allows us to do this.\n\n**Packages:**\n- `@keyshade/schema` should have a `cleanUp` field added in `DeleteIntegrationRequestSchema`\n- `@keyshade/api-client` should pass the `cleanUp` field as a query parameter\n\n## Additional Context\n\nThe details in this issue provides a basic guideline that you can follow to implement the functionality. This is by no means the final implementation - if you have suggestions, please feel free to drop them below.",

[See for example this `cupy` config](https://github.com/cupy/cupy/blob/9816e20b3915dd28bc54a7549f28f69633ceb112/setup.cfg#L25).\r\n\r\n[The documentation can be found here](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/how-to/capture-warnings.html).\r\n\r\nI suggest we start by turning `FutureDeprecationWarning` and `DeprecationWarning` into errors now. We should also explicitly ignore those that we don't care about and ensure that there are no unhandled warnings in the CI by setting, like the example below does with a bare `error`:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2559438/220146833-4b3e02c7-e64d-4c9b-a662-fedbc6fef38c.png)\r\n",

      "url" : "https://github.com/TanStack/db/issues/350",
      "repositoryName" : "TanStack/db",
      "description" : "### Background\n\nTanStack Query provides a `QueryFunctionContext` to query functions with useful properties like `signal` for cancellation and `meta` for passing additional context. Currently, query-db-collection passes this context to the queryFn but doesn't fully utilize or expose these capabilities.\n\n### Current State\n\n```typescript\n// TanStack Query provides:\ninterface QueryFunctionContext {\n  queryKey: QueryKey\n  signal?: AbortSignal  // For cancellation\n  meta?: Record<string, unknown>  // Metadata\n  pageParam?: unknown  // For infinite queries\n}\n\n// Current usage in query-db-collection:\nqueryFn: async (context) => {\n  // context is passed but signal and meta aren't commonly used\n  return api.fetchTodos()\n}\n```\n\n### Problems\n\n1. **No request cancellation**: Can't cancel in-flight requests when collections are cleaned up\n2. **No metadata support**: Can't pass additional context through the query system\n3. **Missed optimization**: Unnecessary network requests continue even after cleanup\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\n#### 1. Document and encourage signal usage\n\n```typescript\nconst todoCollection = createCollection(\n  queryCollectionOptions({\n    queryKey: ['todos'],\n    queryFn: async (context) => {\n      // Use signal for cancellable requests\n      const response = await fetch('/api/todos', {\n        signal: context.signal\n      })\n      \n      if (\\!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to fetch')\n      return response.json()\n    },\n    getKey: (item) => item.id,\n    queryClient,\n  })\n)\n```\n\n#### 2. Add meta support to QueryCollectionConfig\n\n```typescript\nexport interface QueryCollectionConfig<TItem, TError, TQueryKey> {\n  // ... existing options ...\n  \n  /**\n   * Metadata to pass to the query\n   * Available in queryFn via context.meta\n   */\n  meta?: Record<string, unknown>\n}\n```\n\n### Implementation Examples\n\n#### Example 1: Cancellable Fetch with AbortSignal\n\n```typescript\nconst searchCollection = createCollection(\n  queryCollectionOptions({\n    queryKey: ['search', searchTerm],\n    queryFn: async (context) => {\n      try {\n        const response = await fetch(`/api/search?q=${searchTerm}`, {\n          signal: context.signal\n        })\n        return response.json()\n      } catch (error) {\n        if (error.name === 'AbortError') {\n          console.log('Search cancelled')\n          return [] // Return empty results for cancelled requests\n        }\n        throw error\n      }\n    },\n    getKey: (item) => item.id,\n    queryClient,\n  })\n)\n```\n\n#### Example 2: Using Meta for Error Context\n\n```typescript\nconst userCollection = createCollection(\n  queryCollectionOptions({\n    queryKey: ['users', departmentId],\n    queryFn: async (context) => {\n      try {\n        return await api.getUsers(departmentId)\n      } catch (error) {\n        // Use meta for better error messages\n        throw new Error(\n          context.meta?.errorMessage || 'Failed to load users'\n        )\n      }\n    },\n    meta: {\n      errorMessage: `Failed to load users for department ${departmentId}`,\n      feature: 'user-management',\n      retryable: true\n    },\n    getKey: (item) => item.id,\n    queryClient,\n  })\n)\n```\n\n#### Example 3: GraphQL with Cancellation\n\n```typescript\nconst graphqlCollection = createCollection(\n  queryCollectionOptions({\n    queryKey: ['graphql-data'],\n    queryFn: async (context) => {\n      // GraphQL clients often support AbortSignal\n      return graphqlClient.request(\n        QUERY,\n        variables,\n        { signal: context.signal }\n      )\n    },\n    meta: {\n      queryName: 'GetDashboardData',\n      version: 'v2'\n    },\n    getKey: (item) => item.id,\n    queryClient,\n  })\n)\n```\n\n### Technical Implementation\n\n1. **Pass meta through observer options**:\n```typescript\nconst observerOptions: QueryObserverOptions = {\n  queryKey,\n  queryFn,\n  meta: config.meta, // Add this\n  // ... other options\n}\n```\n\n2. **Cancel query on cleanup**:\n```typescript\nreturn async () => {\n  actualUnsubscribeFn()\n  await queryClient.cancelQueries({ queryKey }) // This triggers signal.abort()\n  queryClient.removeQueries({ queryKey })\n}\n```\n\n### Benefits\n\n1. **Performance**: Cancel unnecessary requests when navigating away\n2. **Better debugging**: Meta information helps trace queries\n3. **Resource efficiency**: Prevent orphaned requests from consuming bandwidth\n4. **Feature parity**: Match TanStack Query's full capabilities\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n1. Test that signal.abort() is triggered on collection cleanup\n2. Test that cancelled requests don't update collection state\n3. Test that meta is passed through to queryFn\n4. Test that meta is available in error handlers\n5. Test compatibility with various HTTP clients (fetch, axios, etc.)\n\n### Documentation\n\nUpdate examples to show proper signal usage and meta patterns, especially for:\n- Fetch API\n- Axios\n- GraphQL clients\n- Custom API wrappers",

It's just extra noise for everyone subscribed to this issue.\n* Subscribe to receive notifications on status change and new comments.\n\n---\n\n## Feature request\n\n**Which Nextcloud Version are you currently using:** (see administration page)\n3.15.3 Windows version.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nI have a folder containing a lot of folders with similar names that I need to manually sort and look through so I would like to search them. I disabled Windows search indexing on my Nextcloud directory because windows kept on downloading files I wanted to only keep online every time I searched for something in the parent folder.\n\nThe search function in the Nextcloud tray menu is able to find the desired sub folder, but clicking the folder only opens the containing folder and not the folder itself. This is useless to me because, as said, there are a lot of different folders and the folder names are too similar.\n\nIt looks like Nextcloud just opens the containing folder for folders or files. It would be nice if there was at least a context open to allow opening folder or files.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nOpen folder or file by default and have open containing folder the context menu option, but that risks messing with other people's workflow since open containing folder is the current behavior.",

We want to open \".../folder/subfolder\" directly in our file explorer, but when searching for it in the traymenu search bar and clicking on \"subfolder\" the containing folder \".../folder\" opens. \nFrom the implementation it seems to me as if this was indeed intended by the deliberate use of `QFileInfo(relativePath).path()` instead of simply `relativePath` as an argument to `findFileInLocalFolders` when initializing `localFiles` in _src/gui/tray/unifiedsearchresultlistmodel.cpp_ line 340. \nHowever in the web browser the clicked folder or file is directly opened, rather than the containing folder (currently the case for server versions above 20)\n\nI ask because I am currently working on a fix for this alongside mike and in case the behavior where the containing folder is opened is the desired standard behavior then we would try to implement the behavior requested by OP as a selectable option. Otherwise we would simply make it the default behavior and fix the web browser bug for versions above 20.

'body_html': '<html>\\n<head></head>\\n<body><p>Email HTML Body</p></body>\\n</html>\\n' ...\n``` \nafter 6.0.0:\n```python\n... {'tag': <Account.EmailSent: 'account:email:sent'>, 'user_id': 'id_1' ...\n\n... 'body_html': '<html>\\n<head></head>\\n<body>Email HTML Body</body>\\n</html>\\n', ...\n```\n\nIt's not super clear why this changed this way, and what the smallest, clearest corrective action is.\n\nThe task is to understand what changed in `lxml` 6.0.0 and what changes drove these behavioral changes, and submit a pull request updating lxml version and updates to the codebase, and share those details in the pull request description.\n\nTo only run the email tests, this command helps:\n\n```shell\nT=tests/unit/email/test_init.py make tests\n```\n\nThis test command isolates a single test to expose the issue more clearly:\n\n```shell\nT=tests/unit/email/test_init.py::TestRemovedReleaseFileEmail::test_send_removed_project_release_file_email_to_maintainer TESTARGS=\"-vvv -n0 -p no:sugar\" make tests\n```\n\n<!-- End issue text, leave the following intact -->\n---\n\n**Good First Issue**: This issue is good for first time contributors.

Their `is_flaggable?` was checked when a page was rendered and controls whether to show the 'flag' button. But there's no check when a vote is cast. So if 20 users load a page with a comment on it and all click flag, it's going down past -10.\n\nTo fix this bug, the 'flag' buttons should always be displayed, and the `score` column should be clamped to `FLAGGABLE_MIN_SCORE` by their `update_score_and_recalculate` functions. This almost certainly also touches story hotness and comment confidence as well.",

This is a change from Express 4 less strict behavior and can lead to unexpected 404 Not Found errors after migration, as files inside dot-directories (e.g., `.well-known`) are no longer served by default.\n\nThis is a common \"gotcha\" that can be difficult to debug for developers who are not aware of this specific change.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nA common use case affected by this is serving files from the `.well-known` directory, which is essential for standards like Let's Encrypt (ACME), Android App Links (`assetlinks.json`), and Apple's Universal Links.\n\n**Code that worked in Express 4 but fails silently in Express 5:**\n```javascript\n// In public/.well-known/assetlinks.json exists\napp.use(express.static(\"public\"));\n\n// A request to GET /.well-known/assetlinks.json will result in a 404.\n```\n### Expectations\n\nThe migration guide should explicitly warn developers about this change and provide the recommended solution to prevent breaking important functionality.\n\nI suggest adding a section `express.static.dotfiles` to the **Migrating to Express 5** documentation that highlights this change. It could include:\n\nA clear statement that express.static.dotfiles option default is now 'ignore'.\n\nAn explanation of the impact (e.g., folders like .well-known will become inaccessible).\n\nThe recommended, secure solution for serving specific dot-directories:\n\n```javascript\n// Recommended fix for serving .well-known in Express 5\napp.use(\"/.well-known\", express.static(\"public/.well-known\", {\n  dotfiles: \"allow\"\n}));\n\n// Keep the secure default for all other static assets\napp.use(express.static(\"public\"));\n```\nThis would greatly help the community and make the migration process smoother.\n\nThank you for your great work on Express !",

So when we switch back to `A` _from_ `B` the projection in the style remains that of `B`.\n\nIn our specific use case these objects come from React state, but you can image that there would be other use cases where people would be passing json derived from some other state.\n\nNow, I guess we could use `structuredClone(A)` before calling `setStyle` but then it would still need to be explicitly stated somewhere that this is needed and why it's needed, because from the outside it just manifests like an object reference error.\n\nDoes this help explain things a bit better?", "Yes, thanks.\nIs this the only part of the style that gets mutated? If so, it might be a bug in the projection code as it was added recently and might not go through the original code path of other properties.\nWould you like to try and solve this?", "I won't have any time out of work (kids), but I'll ask if we can maybe put it into our backlog and hopefully get to it in the coming month.", "Also, yeah it only seems to be the projection object that gets mutated as far as I can tell.", "It's probably there from the beginning of version 5 so another month is not too much :-)", "I believe this is caused by the fact that `Map.setStyle` can either perform a diffed or full style update:\nhttps://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js/blob/b1a2d8971000af94b7d0c5e6b8df28bf3c1acd53/src/ui/map.ts#L1858-L1864\nand the user's style object is cloned in the former path but not the latter.\n\nWhen diffed, `Map._diffStyle` ??? `Map._updateDiff` ??? `Style.setState` clones the user style on line 813 before setting `Style.stylesheet = nextState` on line 831.\nThis path is taken by default when the user calls `Map.setStyle`.\nhttps://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js/blob/b1a2d8971000af94b7d0c5e6b8df28bf3c1acd53/src/style/style.ts#L805-L813\n\nWhen not diffed, `Map._updateStyle` ??? `Style.loadURL`/`Style.loadJSON` ??? `Style._load` directly sets `Style.stylesheet = nextState`.\nAFAIK this path is taken when the initial style is loaded.\nhttps://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js/blob/b1a2d8971000af94b7d0c5e6b8df28bf3c1acd53/src/style/style.ts#L419-L426\n\nThus, I am able to observe the reported issue wherever `Style.stylesheet` is mutated via a line like `this.stylesheet.* = ...`, which includes `setProjection`, `setSky`, `setGlyphs`, and `setSprite` (though there may be more).\n\nHere is a modified version of OP's demo which shows `sky`, `glyphs`, and `sprite` also being mutated: https://jsbin.com/zifexoyosu/edit?html,console,output\nNote that by replacing `style: MERCATOR_MAP` with `style: INITIAL_STYLE` in the Map constructor, both MERCATOR_MAP and GLOBE_MAP remain unmutated even after switching back and forth between styles, since it is only the INITIAL_STYLE which takes the no-diff (and therefore no-clone) path.\n\nI can submit a PR which adds a `clone` call to the no-diff path in `Style._load` if that seems like a reasonable solution.\nThe only drawback I can think of with this approach is that maybe this would hurt initial load times for complex styles, though I believe consistency in behaviour is generally more important than performance.", "I believe all these methods were added after the fork and might not follow the original pattern of not mutating the style object.\nIt might be a good idea to revisit the the implementation there and see if cloning is needed as part of these code path.\nGenerally speaking, a lot of the times users place urls in a style and fetching the data from there is almost always immutable since the object is being fetched from a remote server etc...\nAny improvements in this area would be highly appreciated." ],

While these don't affect functionality, they should be fixed for cleaner test output.\n\n## Current Behavior\n\nWhen running the test suite, we see warnings like:\n```\nRuntimeWarning: coroutine 'process_request' was never awaited\n```\n\n## Affected Test Files\n\n1. `tests/characterization/repl/test_input_handling.py` (line 1186)\n2. `tests/characterization/repl/test_multiline_input.py` (line 2188)\n3. `tests/characterization/repl/test_output_display_logic.py` (line 767)\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThese tests are mocking async functions but not properly handling the coroutine objects that are returned. The mock objects need to be configured to return async mock objects or the tests need to properly await the mocked calls.\n\n## Suggested Fix\n\nFor each affected test:\n1. Review how `process_request` is being mocked\n2. Either:\n   - Use `AsyncMock` instead of `Mock` for async functions\n   - Or configure the mock to return an awaited result\n   - Or properly await the mocked calls in the test\n\nExample fix:\n```python\n# Instead of:\nmock_process_request = Mock()\n\n# Use:\nmock_process_request = AsyncMock()\n```\n\n## Test Output\n\nCurrent test results: **250 passed, 12 skipped, 3 warnings**\n\nThe warnings don't affect test execution but should be cleaned up for better test hygiene.\n\n## Additional Context\n\nThese warnings were discovered after fixing the setup script issues in commits 4423a9d and 5711d7c.",

Install clean glpi.\r\n1. Login as glpi:glpi.\r\n1. Go to *Administration* > *Users*.\r\n1. Open the profile of user *glpi*.\r\n1. Add a new location to the profile.\r\n   The location name should contain about 71 `|` symbols.\r\n1. Create and open a new issue with user *glpi*.\r\n1. In the top row of the message, hover the cursor over the *glpi* name to display the tooltip.\r\n1.

      "repositoryName" : "huggingface/transformers",
      "description" : "## Community contributions: Add Fast Image Processors\n\nFast image processors have been rolling out progressively for a while. Now that the [BaseImageProcessorFast](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/image_processing_utils_fast.py#L292), from which all fast image processors inherit, is in a more stable state, I'm opening this issue to encourage contributors to add fast image processors for models that still only have a \"slow\" image processor.\n\n### How to implement a Fast Image Processor\n\nThe core principle of fast image processors is to use `torch` and `torchvision` functions for image transformations instead of `PIL` or `numpy`. Among other performance benefits, this enables processing images on GPU, significantly improving inference speed.\n\nAnother key difference compared to slow image processors is that, unlike `BaseImageProcessor`, which provides only a minimal skeleton, `BaseImageProcessorFast` includes all the fundamental functionalities needed for a basic image processor. This allows optimizations made in BaseImageProcessorFast to propagate to its inherited classes. Additionally, most repetitive logic for image loading and argument handling is managed within BaseImageProcessorFast. Except in rare cases, inherited classes do not need to handle image loading, conversion, or retrieving arguments from class attributes in the call/preprocess function, this is all handled in `BaseImageProcessorFast`.\n\n#### Getting Started\n\nRun the following command:\n```bash\ntransformers-cli add-fast-image-processor --model-name model_name\n```\nwhere `model_name` is the name of the model (as found in its folder under `transformers/src/transformers/models`) for which you're adding the fast image processor.\n\nThis command will handle all necessary imports and generate a basic fast image processor, which will look similar to this example for Beit:\n\n```python\n# coding=utf-8\n# Copyright 2025 The HuggingFace Inc. team.

The class attributes, such as `resample` and `image_mean`, are automatically parsed from the slow image processor when running the script above. However, you should verify their correctness and check for any missing or incorrectly assigned values.\n\n### Customizing the Image Processor\n\nIf the image processor requires additional functionalities beyond the basic augmentations, you will need to override the `_preprocess` function in `BaseImageProcessorFast`. Check the `_preprocess` implementation in `BaseImageProcessorFast` for reference. Notably, it leverages `group_images_by_shape` and `reorder_images` to enable batch processing, significantly increasing processing speed, particularly on GPUs. If you create new image processing functions, ensure they support batch processing by utilizing `group_images_by_shape` and `reorder_images` where possible.\n\nIf your image processor requires additional kwargs not present in [`DefaultFastImageProcessorKwargs`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/image_processing_utils_fast.py#L172), you must create a `ModelNameFastImageProcessorKwargs` class that inherits from `DefaultFastImageProcessorKwargs` and defines the new kwargs. Additionally, you should document the added kwargs in the class and the `preprocess` function using `add_start_docstrings`. (This documentation process may be simplified soon, but is necessary for now to get a correct documentation).\n\nFor an example of handling custom kwargs and documentation, refer to [LlavaNextImageProcessorFast](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/models/llava_next/image_processing_llava_next_fast.py).\n\n### Important Notes\n\n- In nearly all cases, `_preprocess` is the only function in `BaseImageProcessorFast` that needs to be overridden.\n- The `_preprocess` function does not require default values for its arguments, as they are automatically derived from class attributes if not explicitly provided.\n- Even if `PIL` images or `numpy` arrays are passed to the image processor, the `images` argument in `_preprocess` will always be a list of tensors, with the channel dimension first.\n\n### Handling Edge Cases\n\n- **Nested Images:** If images are provided as nested lists (e.g., `[[image1, image2], [image3]]`), they will be flattened to `[image1, image2, image3]` by default before being passed to `_preprocess`. This behavior can be modified by overriding `_prepare_images_structure`, though flattening is generally recommended.\n- **Formatting Custom  Kwargs:** If any custom kwargs require formatting before `_preprocess`, override `_further_process_kwargs`.\n- **Validating Custom Kwargs:** If additional validation is needed for custom kwargs or existing ones, override `_validate_preprocess_kwargs`.\n\n### Testing\n\nIn the case where the model already has a `test_image_processing_model_name.py` file under `transformers/tests/models/model_name`, the script ran before should have imported the fast image processor to the file, and added it as a `fast_image_processing_class` class attribute to the `ModelNameImageProcessingTest` class.\nHowever this is not enough to get all the tests to run on the fast image processor. For all the test functions under `ModelNameImageProcessingTest`, you need to replace `image_processing = self.image_processing_class(**self.image_processor_dict)` with a loop over `self.image_processor_list`.\n\nFor example, the `test_image_processor_properties` test in `test_image_processing_beit.py` which looks like this:\n\n```python\n    def test_image_processor_properties(self):\n        image_processing = self.image_processing_class(**self.image_processor_dict)\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"do_resize\"))\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"size\"))\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"do_center_crop\"))\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"center_crop\"))\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"do_normalize\"))\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"image_mean\"))\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"image_std\"))\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"do_reduce_labels\"))\n```\nshould be changed to this:\n\n```python\n    def test_image_processor_properties(self):\n        for image_processing_class in self.image_processor_list:\n            image_processing = image_processing_class(**self.image_processor_dict)\n            self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"do_resize\"))\n            self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"size\"))\n            self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"do_center_crop\"))\n            self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"center_crop\"))\n            self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"do_normalize\"))\n            self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"image_mean\"))\n            self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"image_std\"))\n            self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"do_reduce_labels\"))\n```\n\nIn the case where no image processing test file is present, now is a great time to add one! You can have a look at the[ CLIP image processing test file](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/ad5d40de9c4d4899d5b79243f63e22c72e8b3669/tests/models/clip/test_image_processing_clip.py) to use as a simple starting point.\n\nDon't hesitate to add model-specific tests if you feel like there are some non-standard image processing techniques in the processor :).\n\nTo run the tests, use this command:\n```bash\nRUN_SLOW=1 python -m pytest tests/models/model_name/test_image_processing_model_name.py\n```\n\n\n### Choosing an Image Processor to Implement\n\nThe difficulty of implementing a fast image processor varies by model.

Good task for this week..!", "@edgarriba I love kornia! But for image processors at inference time, it might be a bit overkill since 90% of the time, we only need a mix of resizing, normalizing, padding, and cropping, combined with some model-specific logic. I???ve found that `torch`/`torchvision` functional transforms usually cover these needs well, and pipelines like kornia `ImageSequential` or torchvision `Compose` aren???t always a good fit because some models require additional processing steps or custom logic in between. We also wanted to avoid adding an extra dependency to Transformers for fast image processors.\n\nThat said, I do think kornia could be valuable down the line, especially for batch processing. I'm still exploring how to optimize batch processing performance on both GPU and CPU, and kornia likely handles this more efficiently than our current approach.", "The core of the library is pure functional -- that has been always the scope.

Locate the Fleet UI code for the Reinstall Integration button\n\nThis is most likely in the Fleet plugin source, under:\n- `x-pack/plugins/fleet/public`\n- Component: Integration policy/Custom integration settings page.\n\nProbable files:\n- `x-pack/plugins/fleet/public/pages/integrations/agent_integration_settings_page/index.tsx`\n- Or, wherever the ???Reinstall integration??? button is rendered, likely a component such as `IntegrationSettings` or similar.\n\n#### 2. Find the logic that disables the button for custom integrations\n\nThere will be a prop or condition like `isCustomIntegration` or similar that disables the button.\n\n#### 3. Update the tooltip/message\n\nThe tooltip is likely conditionally set.  \nUpdate the tooltip/message for the disabled state for custom integrations.\n\n**Current:**  \n- Shows `\"This integration was installed by upload..\"` (incorrect).\n\n**Change to:**  \n- `\"This is a custom integration and cannot be automatically reinstalled.\"`\n\n#### 4.

This issue aims to make the **entire `/feeding` route** fully responsive so that users can easily view and interact with feeding data, logs, and trackers on various screen sizes.\n\n#### ??? Tasks:\n\n* [ ] Refactor layout to adapt for various screen sizes.\n* [ ] Test and optimize layout on:\n\n  * [ ] Mobile devices (e.g., 360px width)\n  * [ ] Tablets (e.g., 768px)\n  * [ ] Desktops (e.g., 1440px+)\n* [ ] Ensure **feeding log cards, buttons, charts, and icons** do not overflow or get clipped.\n* [ ] Verify **forms and inputs** work seamlessly on smaller viewports.\n* [ ] Improve spacing, font size, and element tap areas for better accessibility.\n\n> *###Note:*\n> This issue is **specific to the `/feeding` route**. \\_\n\n#### \uD83E\uDDE0 Suggestions:\n\n* **Stack horizontal sections vertically** on mobile when needed.\n* Use Tailwind???s `flex-wrap`, `gap`, and breakpoint classes (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`) to allow fluid layouts.\n* Watch out for **absolute positioning** or **fixed heights** that might break on small screens.\n\n#### \uD83D\uDEA6 Level 1: (3 Points)\n\n> A frontend-focused task that boosts mobile UX.

      "description" : "**Describe the problem**\n\nWhen the `PageToggleButton` is used with `isHamburgerButton`, it logs this console.error message:\n\n```\nButton: when the isHamburger property is passed in, you must also pass in a boolean value to the isExpanded property. It is expected that a hamburger button controls the expansion of other content.\n```\n\nThis happens because `PageToggleButton` uses the `Button` component internally and correctly passes the `isHamburger` prop, but doesn't pass `isExpanded` with it.\n\n`PageToggleButton` already manages the expanded state using `isSidebarOpen` so we just need to internally map that state with `isExpanded`. \n\n**How do you reproduce the problem?**\n\nSee https://www.patternfly.org/components/page/ and open the dev console to see the console errors. \n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nNo console error when using `PageToggleButton` with `isHamburgerButton`.\n\nComponent should handle its internal state correctly by mapping `isSidebarOpen` to the Button's `isExpanded` prop. \n\nConsumer should not be required to pass `isExpanded` to `PageToggleButton` since we already have `isSidebarOpen` to handle this.\n\n**Proposed Fix**\n\nJust add this line [here](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/blob/main/packages/react-core/src/components/Page/PageToggleButton.tsx#L44):\n`isExpanded={sidebarOpen}` \n\n**Is this issue blocking you?**\nList the workaround if there is one. \n\nBlocking 6.3.0 upgrade in RHOAI Dashboard: https://github.com/opendatahub-io/odh-dashboard/pull/4435 \n\n**Screenshots**\nIf applicable, add screenshots to help explain the issue.\n\n<img width=\"1432\" height=\"827\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c2154cd-c844-4b71-bb3f-917d2ca8b663\" />\n\n**What is your environment?**\n - OS: [e.g. iOS]\n - Browser [e.g. chrome, safari]\n - Version [e.g. 22]\n\n**What is your product and what release date are you targeting?**\nRHOAI 2.24\n\n**Any other information?**\nNone",

Please describe.**\r\nI work in an environment where the majority of the software project cannot be open source due to a variety of security and need-to-know requirements.  However, we'd like to take advantage of some of the great tools made available by the OpenSSF, so we're looking at standing up internal instances of the Best Practices Badge App and securityscorecards.dev.  Once we have the internal Badge App stood up, it would be great if we could just point `scorecard` to it in some way.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI'm flexible on implementation details, and trust whatever you think is best.  Some potential solutions that come to mind:\r\n1. **Environment variable:**  E.g., `CII_BEST_PRACTICES_URL=https://bestpractices.company.com scorecard --repo internal-gitlab.company.com/{owner}/{repo}`.\r\n2. **Command line option:**  E.g., `scorecard --repo internal-gitlab.company.com/{owner}/{repo} --cii-best-practices-url https://bestpractices.company.com`.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nIf this enhancement is undesirable, we can always fork this project internally and replace all instances of `https://www.bestpractices.dev` with our internal Badge App URL.  Looks like that would only need to happen in\r\n- `clients/cii_http_client.go`\r\n- `cron/internal/cii/main.go`\r\n\r\nplus updating some links in a few Markdown and YAML files if we want to be consistent across the board.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nN/A\r\n",

We only convert types if they're used in a context that requires a certain type. When we read an enum from storage, we get an int because enums are stored as ints. So if it gets passed to something that accepts an int, no conversion occurs.\n- We know this because explicitly casting an enum to a text type works correctly. We can look at how that's implemented: it's the method Convert::Eval in `sql/expression/convert.go` in go-mysql-server. We can see that it looks at the static type of the child expression in order to decide how to do the conversion.\n- There must be logic somewhere for coercing values whenever a non-text value is written into a text column. The bug is most likely happening because that coercion needs to behave differently based on whether the static type of the input expression is an enum or not, similar to how Convert::Eval does it.", "For reference, here's a similar issue with enums not being coerced to strings that was fixed last week: https://github.com/dolthub/go-mysql-server/pull/3111 ", "@dxtym Please self-assign if you're working on this issue (otherwise, I'll work on. it).

      "description" : "**Describe the bug**\n\nCurrent logic [here](https://github.com/ag2ai/faststream/blob/main/faststream/middlewares/exception.py#L166) seems to be counterintuitive - take the current exception and check if it's a subclass of any exception type of the registered handlers. This leads to a potential problem that the order of handler registration really matters, but it shouldn't. \n\n\n**How to reproduce**\n\n1. Say I have `class ExcA(Exception)` and `class ExcB(ExcA)` and I have `@exception_middleware.add_handler(ExcA)` defined _before_ `@exception_middleware.add_handler(ExcB)`\n2. Then the handler for `ExcA` (say handler_A) will swallow all exceptions of ExcB type simply because this handler_A is registered first.\n\n**How to fix**\n\nUse starlette's [approach](https://github.com/encode/starlette/blob/master/starlette/_exception_handler.py#L16):\n1. Convert `self._publish_handlers` and `self._handlers` to dicts (possibly a breaking change?)\n2. Iterate over `type(exc).__mro__` and check if this type is in `self._publish_handlers` or `self._handlers` respectively\n3. This guarantees that exception handling middleware will call the closest handler based on the current exception's mro rather than the order in which handlers were registered.\n\nAnd/Or steps to reproduce the behavior:\n\n1. ...\n\n**Expected behavior**\nExplain what you expected to happen clearly and concisely.\n\n**Observed behavior**\nDescribe what is actually happening clearly and concisely.\n\n**Screenshots**\nIf applicable, attach screenshots to help illustrate the problem.\n\n**Environment**\nInclude the output of the `faststream -v` command to display your current project and system environment.\n\n**Additional context**\nProvide any other relevant context or information about the problem here.\n",

Current implementation look logical for me\n\n> Say I have class ExcA(Exception) and class ExcB(ExcA) and I have @exception_middleware.add_handler(ExcA) defined before @exception_middleware.add_handler(ExcB)\n\nWhy you just can't change handlers registration order?\n\n```python\n@exception_middleware.add_handler(ExcB)\n...\n@exception_middleware.add_handler(ExcA)\n```\n\nShould works fine", "> Why you just can't change handlers registration order?\n\nThe problem is that it's not as simple as it sounds, especially for complex applications that handle tens of various (potentially interdependent) exceptions from different libaries and/or application layers. Simply put, there may be a very complex graph of exceptions a user wants to handle (my own case).\n\nIn addition to that, the handlers may be added procedurally which makes in practically very hard to keep the order.\n\nAnd a user has to keep in mind which handlers are `publish=True` and which are not, which also affects the execution order.\n\nCurrent approach puts all this burden of figuring out the correct order of handlers on the user, which I believe isn't great as the library should (and has everything it needs to) handle this transparently and correctly. And as mentioned above,  starlette already does that the right way.", "@dmder okay it has a sence, but I think it looks like a feature request than a bug. So, I change a tag" ],

Focus on specific types of changes (e.g., trigger, patch, retry) for easier debugging or auditing\n\n- Filter by **User**  \n  ??? Track changes or triggers made by specific users for accountability and investigation\n\n- Filter by **Run ID**  \n  ??? Narrow down audit entries to a specific DAG run when debugging or reviewing historical activity\n\n- Filter by **Task ID**  \n  ??? Isolate changes related to a particular task (e.g., task retries, clearing actions)\n\n- Filter by **Try Number**  \n  ??? Investigate retries or understand the progression of failed attempts on a specific task\n\n- Filter by **Map Index**  \n  ??? Useful when debugging mapped tasks to understand which specific iteration had issues\n\n### API Support  \n\n?????? Partial\n\n- Audit log entries are retrieved per DAG\n- API supports filtering by some fields, but query parameters are not consistently exposed in UI or public API\n- Requires extending API to support structured filtering on audit metadata\n\n### UI Impact  \n\n- Filters could be added above the audit log table\n- Enhances ability to perform root cause analysis on user-initiated changes, retries, and failures\n\n### Notes  \n\n- Current audit log is helpful but difficult to navigate without filtering\n- These filters would improve security auditing, user accountability, and debugging workflows\n\n### Committer\n\n- [x] I acknowledge that I am a maintainer/committer of the Apache Airflow project.",

It would be helpful, if it returned an `AndWhichConstraint`, so that one could continue working with the value.\n\n### API Proposal\nThe following two methods should get a changed return type as follows:\n\n```C#\npublic new AndWhichConstraint<TAssertions> Contain(KeyValuePair<TKey, TValue> expected,\n    [StringSyntax(\"CompositeFormat\")] string because = \"\", params object[] becauseArgs);\n\npublic AndWhichConstraint<TAssertions> Contain(TKey key, TValue value,\n    [StringSyntax(\"CompositeFormat\")] string because = \"\", params object[] becauseArgs)\n```\n\n### Risks\n\nNone. Not a breaking change, see discussion in #49.\n\n### Are you willing to help with a proof-of-concept (as PR in that or a separate repo) first and as pull-request later on?\n\nNo",

For instance, we could have some understanding of things like HSTS and CSP based on the response headers, we could look at connection reuse and transport type, all of which contribute to some extent to TLS handshake performance (though not exhaustive).\r\n\r\nThe problem is that bigger gains are almost always going to be on things we just can't see (as you've noted @patrickhulce), everything from termination distance to record size. That, and offering recommendations on TLS is tough as a whole; saying \"you should use HSTS\" isn't to be taken lightly on the implementer side given potential repercussions if misconfigured.\r\n\r\nWould be nice-to-have something, but I worry if the lack of completeness would hamper such an effort. :man_shrugging: ", "Yeah great points @justinribeiro!

The returned time must include the time interval to establish the transport connection, as well as other time intervals such as SSL handshake and SOCKS authentication.\r\n\r\nSo by typing `performance.getEntriesByType(\"resource\")` you receive that info in the console for all objects associated to that page (I'm assuming). \r\n\r\nI haven't spent anytime with it too see if i can pull meaningful numbers from it.

This will ensure that the variable initialization happens before the goto statement is executed. Here's how we can modify the function `f_decls3` to fix this issue:\r\n```double f_decls3(double x, double y) {\r\n  double a, b, c;\r\n  a = 3 * x;\r\n  c = 333 * y;\r\n  if (x > 1)\r\n    goto label1;\r\n  else if (x < -1) {\r\n    double temp = -2 * a;\r\n    goto label2;\r\n  }\r\n  b = a * a;\r\nlabel1:\r\n  return 2 * a;\r\nlabel2:\r\n  return temp;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIn this modified code, we declare all the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` at the beginning of the function before any goto statements. For the goto statement in the first `if` condition, we don't need to declare any new variables, so we can simply jump to the appropriate label. For the goto statement in the second `else if` condition, we declare a new variable `temp` before the goto statement, and then jump to the appropriate label. Finally, we declare the variable `b` before the final return statement and then return its value.\r\n\r\nBy following this approach, we ensure that all variables are initialized before any goto statements are executed, and we avoid the error of jumping past variable initialization.", "Hello @parth-07, \r\n\r\nI ran the attached code and did not receive any errors. I tested the code using the \"f_decls3\" function (the example given in the issue) and the \"f_add2\" function as provided in the \"Gradients.c\" file in the test folder. \r\n\r\nThe objective of the code was to verify the following:\r\n\r\n    1. The \"f_decls3_grad\" and \"f_add2_grad\" functions were successfully auto generated upon calling their respective clad::gradient(). These derived functions could also be called in the main() function. (See the attached code.)\r\n\r\n    2. The function generated by the \"dump()\" function is the same function that has been commented in the attached file. Additionally, when we simply define the \"f_add2_grad\" function and call it, we get the same result. Note that in this case, we do not call the clad::gradient() and TEST() macros.\r\n    \r\n    auto f = clad::gradient(f_decls3);\r\n    f.dump();\r\n    \r\n    3. If we call TEST() macro and define f_add2_grad() then only we get the following error.\r\n\r\nerror: definition with same mangled name '_Z11f_add2_gradddN4clad9array_refIdEES1_' as another definition\r\ngoto.cpp:12:9: note: previous definition is here\r\n   void f_add2_grad(double x, double y, clad::array_ref<double> _d_x, clad::array_ref<double> _d_y) {\r\n        ^\r\n1 error generated.\r\n \r\nThis error is to be expected because clad::gradient(...); generates its respective grad function which clashes with the manually written grad function.\r\n\r\nI think this issue should be closed.\r\nI did not encounter the error mentioned in the issue.

Since no one is working on this issue right now, I would like to fix it.\n\nI have a clear, step-by-step plan to find the problem and solve it.\n\nHere are the steps I will take:\n\n**Step 1: Check the Frontend (What the User Sees)**\n\n* First, I will find the code for the chat page and its buttons.\n* I will check the \"Chat Categories\" and \"Suggested Questions\" buttons to see if they respond when clicked.\n* I'll use tools like `console.log` to see if the app is correctly noticing the clicks and trying to do something.\n\n**Step 2: Check the Connection to the AI**\n\n* Next, I'll check if the app actually tries to send the user's message to the AI service.\n* Using the browser's developer tools, I will watch the network to see if a message is sent out. I'll check if it's going to the right server address and what the server's response is.\n* I will also make sure that the secret API key for the OpenAI service is set up correctly in the project.\n\n**Step 3: Fix the Problem and Make it Better**\n\n* Once I find the root cause of the bug, I will write the code to fix it.\n* As you suggested in the bug report, I will also improve the user experience. I'll add a loading icon to show when the AI is \"thinking,\" and a simple error message if something goes wrong.\n\nI believe this plan will help me find the problem and fix it properly. I am ready to start working on this now.\n\nCould you please assign Issue #168 to me?" ],

Ok I'll take a look at it.", "@rjl493456442 I???ve identified the cause of the failing test, but it appears to stem from a deeper issue. I would appreciate if you have any advice.\n\nThe cause is in the loop here:\n\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/ethclient/ethclient_test.go#L513-L523\n\n`PendingTransactionCount()` never returns `1`, causing the test to hang and eventually timeout after 10 minutes. I could reproduce this issue locally and confirmed. \n\nEven in failure cases, the preceding `sendTransaction()` appears to successfully send the transaction, but it never reaches the pending state.\n\nA suspicious behavior is that the `nonce` used for the transaction is retrieved using `ec.NonceAt()`, and it returns `2` in both successful and failing cases. However, when I inspected the result of `ec.PendingNonceAt(context.Background(), testAddr)` just before sending, I saw that it returned `2` in the success case, but `0` in the failure case. This might indicate that the two transactions added here:\n\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/ethclient/ethclient_test.go#L134-L138\n\nwere never actually included in the failure case, meaning there might be deeper instability in how test-backend is initialized.\n\nI thought getting nonce using `PendingNonceAt()` might help, as it returns nonce `0` which matches initial state of backend, but `PendingTransactionCount` keeps returning `0`.\n\nOne workaround would be to retry this test several times and pass it if it succeeds once??? though I know that???s not an excellent solution.\n\nI???d appreciate hearing your thoughts on this." ],

Introducing useI18n will align Intlayer with common patterns, easing adoption and supporting type safety.\n\nGoals\nProvide a hook useI18n(namespace) returning a translation function t(key[, props]).\nEnsure type-safe, autocompleted keys scoped to the namespace.\nMaintain compatibility with the existing Intlayer API and support SSR in future iterations.\n\nProposal\nImplement useI18n in the React adapter as a wrapper over useIntlayer.\nUse the existing getNesting utility for nested key resolution and typing.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nconst t = useI18n('IndexPage');\nt('title'); // returns the translated string for 'IndexPage.title'\nTechnical Considerations\nTypes imported from @intlayer/core ensure namespace and key validation at compile time.\n```\nNo breaking changes; useIntlayer remains supported.\n\nServer-side API will follow a similar interface for SSR support.\n\nTesting\nUnit and integration tests to ensure correct translation retrieval and typing enforcement.\n\nNext Steps\nImplement in packages/react-intlayer/src/client/useI18n.ts.\n\nValidate usage and gather feedback.\n\nExtend to Vue, Preact, and server environments later.\n\n@aymericzip, please verify the spec so that I can proceed", "yes perfect @lhcee3 \n\njust ensure as well that the arguments of useI18n and t are typed, you can get inspiration from https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/blob/main/packages/@intlayer/core/src/transpiler/nesting/nesting.ts\n\nexample of nesting usage:\n`    test: nest('access-key-form', 'access-key.key'),`\n" ],

      "description" : "### Describe the problem\n\nI have an automated release process. For the duration of the release I want to lock the repository, and then unlock the repository when the release is complete (either successful, or if an error occurred).\n\nI.e., achieve the same effect as opening https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/pachli/#repository and clicking the \"Lock\" button in the \"Repository status\" section of the UI.\n\n### Solution brainstorm\n\nThere's an API to lock individual components (https://docs.weblate.org/en/latest/api.html#post--api-components-(string-project)-(string-component)-lock-), but I can't find anything that locks the project / repository in the same way clicking the button in the UI does.\n\nSo I'd like a single API call that achieves the same effect as clicking the Lock/Unlock button in the UI.\n\nGiven the existing API this would probably work with the following changes:\n\n- `GET /api/projects/(string: project)/repository/` -- add a `locked` property, true if all the project's components are locked, false if one or more are unlocked (or, whatever logic is used to determine whether to show a \"Lock\" or \"Unlock\" button in the UI). Called `locked` for consistency with the same property on the `GET /api/components/(string: project)/(string: component)/` response.\n- `POST /api/projects/(string: project)/repository/` -- add `lock` and `unlock` to the list of available operations\n\n### Describe alternatives you have considered\n\nI could call https://docs.weblate.org/en/latest/api.html#get--api-components- and then repeatedly call the per-component API to lock the component.\n\nThis feels fragile. If I get part way through locking all of the components and one of the calls fails my project is in an inconsistent state. It's also more overall API calls to the backend (so, slower), and doesn't scale as more components are added.\n\nPoking at the web UI, it POSTS to `hosted.weblate.org/lock/pachli` (obviously, not an API endpoint) which (if I've read the code correctly) eventually gets to https://github.com/WeblateOrg/weblate/blob/main/weblate/trans/models/project.py#L769\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

Useful to isolate backfills that targeted a specific data range\n\n- Filter by **Created At**  \n  ??? Helps identify when backfills were initiated (e.g., ad hoc vs. automated)\n\n- Filter by **Completed At**  \n  ??? Enables monitoring of completion lag or stuck backfills\n\n- Filter by **Duration**  \n  ??? Surfaces long-running backfills that may impact system performance\n\n- Filter by **Reprocess Behavior**  \n  ??? Distinguish between missing-only backfills and full-range reprocessing\n\n- Filter by **Max Active Runs**  \n  ??? Useful when diagnosing throttling or concurrency constraints in backfill execution\n\n- Filter by **Status**  \n  ??? Surface failed or incomplete backfills\n\n\n### API Support  \n\n??? Yes\n\n- `/dags/{dag_id}/backfills` supports filtering via:\n  - `start_date`, `end_date`\n  - `created_at`, `completed_at`\n  - `status`, `table.duration`, `table.reprocessBehavior`, `max_active_runs`\n\n### UI Impact  \n\n- Add filter controls above the backfill table (consistent with DAG Runs tab)\n- Consider sortable columns and pill filters for behavior or status\n- Could also support \"re-run\" or \"cancel\" from filtered selection\n\n### Notes  \n\n- Users often need to investigate reprocessing activity during incidents\n- Filtering helps correlate performance issues with large or frequent backfills",

Spacing should be done by the content itself. This does not only apply to MudAutocomplete but all components and templates.\r\n\r\nMy current workaround is to add the following CSS style\r\n```\r\n.mud-autocomplete-before-items.pa-1:empty {\r\n    padding: 0px !important;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Reproduction link\n\nhttps://try.mudblazor.com/snippet/GkwyOKviyaedGjqr\n\n### Reproduction steps\n\n1.

Ran into this before\r\n\r\nI doubt that it is not possible because `RenderFragment` is a delegate.\r\n\r\nYour approach would be detecting, if the fragment is empty and not rendering the container and content at all in the component?\r\n\r\nThat still leaves the problem of responsibility for spacing if the fragment is not empty. From my point of view the fragments content is responsible for spacing not the component it is passed to. That way provides the most flexibility.\r\n\r\nE.g. currently it is not possible to include some content with different background color without having that annoying padding-border. I mean it is possible by introducing a negative margin on the content but that is dependent on the used padding of the container. That is always subject of change and not reliable. Best way would be just not introducing it at all.", "Actually I found another [workaround](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/10270#issuecomment-493103994) by conditionally assigning the `RenderFragment`.

Configure a module or script to submit a sitemap ping to `https://www.google.com/ping?sitemap=https://example.com/sitemap.xml`\n2. Trigger a sitemap update.\n3. Observe the response from Google (404 or failure).\n\n## Proposed resolution\n- Investigate all search engine ping settings.\n- Identify where in **xmlsitemap** (or other related contrib modules) the ???Notify search engines??? configuration is set.\n- **Disable the Google ping option** (and/or remove the setting if no longer applicable).\n- Ensure that any default configuration in AZ Quickstart does **not attempt to ping Google**.\n- Document that sitemap submission for Google should now be handled through [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console).\n- Review whether other search engine ping options (e.g., Bing) are still valid and adjust accordingly.\n\n### Expected behavior\nNo attempts to ping deprecated Google endpoints.

The conversion functions to and from `Cairo.Color` (which is in straight alpha) should do the alpha conversion as well since it's very easy to accidentally miss this.\n- [x] Verify the correctness of `ColorDifference()` which seems to multiply by alpha (done in #1639)\n- [x] The `HexString`-related methods could likely be merged into `Cairo.Color`  (done in #1626)",

This issue aims to make the **entire `/Medical` route** fully responsive so that users can easily view and interact with Medical data, logs, and trackers on various screen sizes.\n\n#### ??? Tasks:\n\n* [ ] Refactor layout to adapt for various screen sizes.\n* [ ] Test and optimize layout on:\n\n  * [ ] Mobile devices (e.g., 360px width)\n  * [ ] Tablets (e.g., 768px)\n  * [ ] Desktops (e.g., 1440px+)\n* [ ] Ensure **Medical log cards, buttons, data (like contacts and vaccine report logs), and icons** do not overflow or get clipped.\n* [ ] Verify **forms and inputs** work seamlessly on smaller viewports.\n* [ ] Improve spacing, font size, and element tap areas for better accessibility.\n\n> *Note:*\n> This issue is **specific to the `/Medical` route**. \\\n\n#### \uD83E\uDDE0 Suggestions:\n\n* **Stack horizontal sections vertically** on mobile when needed.\n* Use Tailwind???s `flex-wrap`, `gap`, and breakpoint classes (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`) to allow fluid layouts.\n* Watch out for **absolute positioning** or **fixed heights** that might break on small screens.\n\n#### \uD83D\uDEA6 Level 1: (3 Points)\n\n> A frontend-focused task that boosts mobile UX. No backend edits needed, but requires a keen eye for layout polishing and responsive design best practices.\n\n(see [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/AditiGupta-tech/neonest/blob/main/Contributing.md#-points--difficulty-levels))\n\n---\n\n**_??????

      "description" : "### Area of Issue\n\n - [x] API\n\n### Issue Description: \nJavaScript allows objects to destructured to extract references to specific properties, such as functions (see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring) and is a common pattern used to simplify es6 code. However, unless the function's scope is bound, this can cause issues with some function implementations. This is dealt with for the DesktopAgentProxy implementation:\n\nhttps://github.com/finos/FDC3/blob/d4a261a043d994670130ecbe177ca9aabea4e87b/packages/fdc3-agent-proxy/src/DesktopAgentProxy.ts#L51-L75\n\nBut has not been done for other objects returned through the API, including:\n- [DefaultChannel](https://github.com/finos/FDC3/blob/main/packages/fdc3-agent-proxy/src/channels/DefaultChannel.ts)\n- [DefaultPrivateChannel](https://github.com/finos/FDC3/blob/main/packages/fdc3-agent-proxy/src/channels/DefaultPrivateChannel.ts)\n- [DefaultIntentResolution](https://github.com/finos/FDC3/blob/main/packages/fdc3-agent-proxy/src/intents/DefaultIntentResolution.ts)\n\nAdd binding to each of these in their constructors.\n\nAlso add advice to the documentation that other JS implementations SHOULD bind the functions on these objects to support destructuring as we SHOULD be at least _encouraging_ consistency across implementations at a minimum. Better would be to require it (MUST).\n",

Also for a complete local experience i installed ollama. Ollama was installed using this guide: [Ollama - docs.cognee.ai](https://docs.cognee.ai/how-to-guides/cognee-sdk/run-cognee-local-llms-ollama)\n\n\nAfter that i used this guide where i wanted to test my setup via the api: [API - docs.cognee.ai](https://docs.cognee.ai/how-to-guides/cognee-sdk/use-the-api) \nStep 1-3: works without any problems.\nIn Step 4 (Uploading the Document) i got following in return: **{\"error\":\"No module named 'distributed'\"}**\n\nSo i took a look at the output and saw:\n\n```bash\n??? /app/cognee/infrastructure/databases/graph/get_graph_engine.py:15 in get_graph_engine            ???\n???                                                                                                  ???\n???    12 ???   # Get appropriate graph configuration based on current async context                   ???\n???    13 ???   config = get_graph_context_config()                                                    ???\n???    14 ???                                                                                          ???\n??? ???  15 ???   graph_client = create_graph_engine(**config)                                           ???\n???    16 ???                                                                                          ???\n???    17 ???   # Async functions can't be cached.

      "description" : "\uD83D\uDCCB Summary\n\nExtend the CodeGraph pipeline beyond Python to support multiple programming languages including JavaScript/TypeScript, Java, C#, Go, Rust, and others for comprehensive code repository analysis.\n\n\uD83D\uDD0D Background\n\nCurrently, CodeGraph pipeline only processes Python files (.py) and uses Python-specific parsing logic. Modern repositories often contain multiple languages that should be analyzed together for complete understanding.\n\n\uD83C\uDFAF Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. Language Support\n\nJavaScript/TypeScript: .js, .ts, .jsx, .tsx files\n\nJava: .java files with package imports\n\nC#: .cs files with using statements\n\nGo: .go files with import statements\n\nRust: .rs files with use statements\n\nC/C++: .c, .cpp, .h, .hpp files\n\n2. File Discovery Enhancement\n\nUpdate get_source_code_files() to accept language_config parameter\n\nAdd language-specific file extension mapping\n\nSupport multi-language repository scanning\n\n3. Language-Specific Parsing\n\nExtend tree-sitter integration for each language\n\nCreate language-specific dependency extractors\n\nHandle different import/module systems:\n\nPython: import, from...import\n\nJavaScript: import, require, export\n\nJava: import, package\n\nGo: import, package\n\n4. Configuration\n\nAdd supported_languages parameter to run_code_graph_pipeline()\n\nLanguage detection from file extensions\n\nPer-language exclusion patterns\n\n5. CodeGraph Entities Update\n\nExtend CodeFile entity with language type\n\nLanguage-specific dependency relationships\n\nCross-language dependency detection",

      "comments" : [ "This is a great find, and your diagnosis seems on point. The core of the issue is that FontAwesome icons can have variable widths, while the default `.mud-icon-root` styling is optimized for the uniform, square aspect ratio of Material Icons.\n\nFontAwesome provides a dedicated class to solve this exact problem: `fa-fw` (fixed-width). This class ensures that icons align correctly inside components like buttons or lists. Could you try adding it to your icon definition to see if it resolves the issue?\n\nFor example:\n`<MudIconButton Icon=\"@(\"fas fa-eye fa-fw\")\" />`\n\nRegarding your suggestion to modify `.mud-icon-root`, that's an interesting thought for a library-level fix. The main challenge, as you hinted, is that a global change could have unintended side effects on Material Icons or other icon packs. If a fix were to be implemented in the core library, it would likely need to be more targeted, applying styles only when FontAwesome-specific classes like `.fas` or `.far` are present on the element.\n\n---\n*This comment was automatically generated using AI.

Most of the existing docs focus on installation, setup, or process, but not on helping someone understand the big picture, core flows, or architecture.\n\nA dedicated `LEARN.md` will bridge this gap, making it easier for developers to onboard, navigate the code, and understand both the \"what\" and the \"why\" behind major features and architectural decisions.\n\n---\n\n## \uD83D\uDCA1 Motivation\n\n* **Reduce onboarding friction** for new contributors by centralizing knowledge and project walkthroughs.\n* **Make the codebase more accessible** to junior devs, students, and first-time open source contributors.\n* **Clarify architecture and key flows** beyond what is covered in the `README.md` or technical setup files.\n* **Encourage higher-quality contributions** by showing best practices, conventions, and core concepts up front.\n\n---\n\n<details>\n<summary>\uD83D\uDCDD <strong>Proposed Solution: Structure for LEARN.md</strong> (click to expand)</summary>\n\n### LEARN.md Outline (Suggested)\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>\uD83D\uDE80 What Is Dev-Elevate?

Architectural Deep Dive (How Everything Connects)</strong></summary>\n\n* **Frontend (`Client/`):** React (with Vite for speed), written in TypeScript, styled using Tailwind. Handles all UI, routing, and makes API calls to backend.\n* **Backend (`Server/`):** Node.js with Express. All REST APIs, authentication (likely JWT), and business logic.\n* **Shared contract:** Environment variables and documented endpoints.\n\n**Data flow example:**\n\n1. User logs in (Client sends POST to Server `/api/login`)\n2. Server validates, sends back JWT token\n3. Client stores JWT (in memory or localStorage)\n4. Client uses JWT for future requests (protected endpoints)\n\n**Deployment:** Designed for cloud (e.g., Vercel/Render/Heroku for client/server split)\n\n---\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>5. Core Features Explained (With Flowcharts)</strong></summary>\n\n**User Authentication Flow:**\n\n* User submits login\n* API verifies creds\n* Success: returns JWT\n* Client stores JWT\n* All further requests send JWT in headers\n\n**Other Features:**\n\n* Dashboard: User-specific data pulled from backend\n* ???Practice/Job??? modules: Not explicit in code tree, but likely features based on project theme\n* Error handling: Server sends status codes, client parses and displays feedback\n\n**See code:** For full flow, check `DevElevate/Client/` components and `DevElevate/Server/index.js` routes.\n\n---\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>6. Frontend: The Client App</strong></summary>\n\n* **Stack:** React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS\n* **Configs:** `vite.config.ts`, `tailwind.config.js`, `tsconfig.json`, `.env.local`\n* **Main files:** Components, pages, hooks (see `src/`)\n* **Dev workflow:**\n\n  * `npm install`\n  * `npm run dev`\n* **Hot reload & instant feedback**\n\n**Debug tip:** Start with `index.html` (entry), then follow routing in main component tree.\n\n---\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>7. Backend: The Server API</strong></summary>\n\n* **Stack:** Node.js + Express\n* **Configs:** `.env.sample`, `package.json`, scripts\n* **Main file:** `index.js` (API entry point)\n* **Common scripts:** `test-jwt.js`, `create-test-logs.js`\n* **RESTful design:** All logic in `/api/` endpoints\n\n**Auth/Protected routes:** Look for JWT middleware in routes (often called `auth.js` or directly in route code)\n\n**Debug tip:** Use Postman or curl to hit endpoints locally???read error messages, check console output in server.\n\n---\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>8. How to Run and Actually Debug This Project</strong></summary>\n\n**A. Running Locally:**\n\n* Clone repo\n* Install deps in both `Client` and `Server`\n* Copy `.env.sample` in Server to `.env` (add secrets, DB string)\n* `cd Client && npm run dev` (usually [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173))\n* `cd ../Server && npm run dev` (usually [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000))\n\n**B. Debugging:**\n\n* Check browser dev tools (Network tab) for failed requests\n* Look at Server logs for errors (console output)\n* Use breakpoints in VSCode (Node debugging, Chrome for React)\n* Inspect `.env` for typos or missing values\n\n**C. Pro tip:** Change code, see instant effect thanks to Vite/hot reload.\n\n---\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>9. Common Workflows (What a Real Contributor Does)</strong></summary>\n\n1. **Explore:** Read `README.md`, this `LEARN.md`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md`\n2. **Clone & Setup:** Fork, clone, install, run both servers\n3. **Pick an Issue:** See GitHub Issues (look for labels: `good first issue`, `documentation`, `bug`)\n4. **Make a Branch:** Never PR to main; always branch off\n5. **Code & Test:** Small commits, self-review before PR\n6. **Push & PR:** Clear title, reference any related issues\n7. **Respond to Reviews:** Open, friendly, and ready to learn\n\n---\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>10. Best Practices, Gotchas, & Style Guide</strong></summary>\n\n* **Use TypeScript where possible** (type-safety = fewer bugs)\n* **Commit messages:** Be concise but clear (`fix:`, `feat:`, `docs:`, etc.)\n* **Follow PR template:** The more info, the better\n* **.env safety:** Never commit secrets or real env files\n* **Lint/format:** Use ESLint + Prettier (check for configs in Client)\n* **Consistent naming:** Functions, files, and branches (see existing code)\n* **DRY:** Don???t Repeat Yourself???reuse components & utilities\n* **Read error messages fully:** 90% of issues are fixable with careful reading\n\n---\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>11.

By design the SDK should allow only one plugins to be registered, because the passed-in instance will be the one used to implement the C symbols required by the plugin API.\r\n\r\n**Expected behaviour**\r\n\r\nThe SDK should either:\r\n1) Block code like the above at compile time (unfeasible, I think)\r\n2) Return an error or panic with an expressive failure reason\r\n",

Each operator corresponds to a mathematical function, usually described in framework's documentation or an AI standard, such as ONNX.\r\nOpenVINO ONNX Frontend is a component responsible for working with ONNX graphs and requires implementation of different ONNX operators in order to use ONNX models.\r\nThis task requires alignment between OpenVINO ONNX Frontend and original framework implementations of AveragePool for next list of opsets: [opset 7](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/main/docs/Changelog.md#AveragePool-7),  [opset 10](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/main/docs/Changelog.md#AveragePool-10),  [opset 11](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/main/docs/Changelog.md#AveragePool-11),  [opset 19](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/main/docs/Changelog.md#AveragePool-19)\r\nNecessary help will be provided by ONNX Fronted team.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What needs to be done?\r\n\r\nOperator details can be found in [ONNX Operators](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/main/docs/Operators.md#AveragePool)\r\nMore details can be found in ONNX Changelog: [opset 7](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/main/docs/Changelog.md#AveragePool-7),  [opset 10](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/main/docs/Changelog.md#AveragePool-10),  [opset 11](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/main/docs/Changelog.md#AveragePool-11),  [opset 19](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/main/docs/Changelog.md#AveragePool-19)\r\n1. Operator already has a common implementation in OpenVINO. First of all, you need to review a documentation and prepare a table with differences between versions. It could be, for instance, a missing property, extended/reduced coverage of existing property, etc...\r\n2. Copy existing implementation [here](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/tree/master/src/frontends/onnx/frontend/src/op) to make it aligned with original framework (extend or reduce coverage of a common implementation). Copy of modified implementation should be in a defined opset, or in opset 1 in case it implements oldest implementation. [Example of multi-opset operation](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/src/frontends/onnx/frontend/src/op/softmax.cpp#L50).\r\n3. Register the function in [ops_bridge.cpp](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/src/frontends/onnx/frontend/src/ops_bridge.cpp#L554-L560) while keeping alphabetical order\r\n4. Create test model(s) in [ONNX models directory](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/tree/master/src/frontends/onnx/tests/models/). OpenVINO test infrastructure then converts prototxt files to ONNX models - you will use those models later in tests\r\n5. Add tests covering all use cases [here](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/src/frontends/onnx/tests/onnx_import.in.cpp)\r\n6. Check [Python xfailed tests](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/src/frontends/onnx/tests/tests_python/test_backend.py) to find a test marked as a xfailed for added functionality. If any exist - remove corresponding lines and try to verify by using cmdline \"python -m pytest -k name_of_test\".\r\nMore details in [adding operators to ONNX Frontend guide](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/src/frontends/onnx/docs/how_to_add_op.md)\r\n\r\n### Example Pull Requests\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\n\r\n- [Contribution guide - start here!](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n- [Intel DevHub Discord channel](https://discord.gg/wPuqAujS) - engage in discussions, ask questions and talk to OpenVINO developers\r\n- [What is OpenVINO?](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino#what-is-openvino-toolkit)\r\n- [User documentation](https://docs.openvino.ai/)\r\n- Guides on [ONNX Frontend architecture](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/src/frontends/onnx/docs/architecture.md) and [ONNX Frontend tests](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/src/frontends/onnx/docs/tests.md) are also available\r\n- You can also see a [blog post on contributing to OpenVINO](https://medium.com/openvino-toolkit/how-to-contribute-to-an-ai-open-source-project-c741f48e009e)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Contact points\r\n\r\n@gkrivor\r\n\r\n### Ticket\r\n\r\n_No response_",

It means it looks like as an any of documented opset (for example, 7,10,11,19), but doesn't implement exact opset functionality (allows to use an undocumented input types, use wrong inputs, etc).\r\n\r\nThat's why we want to align behavior with the original documentation. Because otherwise, when you pass a model with a 19 opset it fails due to a common implementation uses wrong input (input instead of an attribute, as example), but you will get any possible error and will spend a lot of time to understand what goes wrong. I'm sure previous approach was very good for a fast implementation.

      "title" : "Fix staleTime behavior in query-db-collection by tracking component subscriptions",
      "url" : "https://github.com/TanStack/db/issues/348",
      "repositoryName" : "TanStack/db",
      "description" : "### Background\n\nCurrently, `query-db-collection` creates a single QueryObserver that stays subscribed to TanStack Query for the entire lifecycle of the collection. This breaks TanStack Query's staleTime behavior because from Query's perspective, there's always an \"active\" observer.\n\n### The Problem\n\n**Expected behavior (like useQuery):**\n1. Component mounts ??? Query becomes active\n2. Component unmounts ??? Query becomes inactive, staleTime timer starts  \n3. Component remounts within staleTime ??? No refetch occurs\n4. Component remounts after staleTime ??? Refetch occurs\n\n**Current behavior in query-db-collection:**\n1. Collection starts sync ??? QueryObserver subscribes and stays subscribed\n2. Query is ALWAYS active from TanStack Query's perspective\n3. staleTime never applies because query never goes \"inactive\"\n4. refetchOnWindowFocus always triggers regardless of staleTime\n\n### Evidence\n\nFrom query.ts:303-332:\n```typescript\nconst internalSync: SyncConfig<TItem>['sync'] = (params) => {\n  // Creates observer when collection starts sync\n  const localObserver = new QueryObserver(queryClient, observerOptions)\n  \n  // Subscribes immediately and stays subscribed\n  const actualUnsubscribeFn = localObserver.subscribe((result) => {\n    // ... sync logic\n  })\n  \n  // Only unsubscribes when collection is cleaned up\n  return async () => {\n    actualUnsubscribeFn()\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Root Cause\n\nCollections already track subscriber count (lines 663-685 in collection.ts), but query-db-collection doesn't use this information to manage its QueryObserver lifecycle.\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nModify query-db-collection to subscribe/unsubscribe its QueryObserver based on the collection's subscriber count:\n\n```typescript\nconst internalSync: SyncConfig<TItem>['sync'] = (params) => {\n  const { collection } = params\n  let localObserver: QueryObserver | null = null\n  let queryUnsubscribe: (() => void) | null = null\n\n  // Track when collection gains/loses subscribers\n  const originalAddSubscriber = collection.addSubscriber\n  const originalRemoveSubscriber = collection.removeSubscriber\n\n  // Override to manage QueryObserver lifecycle\n  collection.addSubscriber = function() {\n    const wasInactive = this.activeSubscribersCount === 0\n    originalAddSubscriber.call(this)\n    \n    // Create QueryObserver when first subscriber added\n    if (wasInactive && \\!localObserver) {\n      localObserver = new QueryObserver(queryClient, observerOptions)\n      queryUnsubscribe = localObserver.subscribe((result) => {\n        // ... existing sync logic\n      })\n    }\n  }\n\n  collection.removeSubscriber = function() {\n    originalRemoveSubscriber.call(this)\n    \n    // Cleanup QueryObserver when last subscriber removed\n    if (this.activeSubscribersCount === 0 && localObserver) {\n      queryUnsubscribe?.()\n      localObserver = null\n      queryUnsubscribe = null\n      // Now TanStack Query's staleTime timer can start\n    }\n  }\n\n  return async () => {\n    // Restore original methods\n    collection.addSubscriber = originalAddSubscriber\n    collection.removeSubscriber = originalRemoveSubscriber\n    \n    // Final cleanup\n    queryUnsubscribe?.()\n    await queryClient.cancelQueries({ queryKey })\n    queryClient.removeQueries({ queryKey })\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Alternative Approach\n\nInstead of overriding methods, collections could expose subscriber count changes via events:\n\n```typescript\n// In collection.ts\nprivate notifySubscriberCountChange(count: number) {\n  this.emit('subscriberCountChanged', count)\n}\n\n// In query-db-collection\ncollection.on('subscriberCountChanged', (count) => {\n  if (count === 0 && localObserver) {\n    // Unsubscribe QueryObserver\n  } else if (count === 1 && \\!localObserver) {\n    // Subscribe QueryObserver  \n  }\n})\n```\n\n### Benefits\n\n1. **Proper staleTime behavior**: Data goes stale when no components are using it\n2. **Better performance**: Avoids unnecessary refetches within staleTime window\n3. **Memory efficiency**: Queries can be garbage collected after gcTime\n4. **TanStack Query compatibility**: Behaves like regular useQuery hooks\n\n### Test Cases\n\n1. Component mounts ??? Query should become active, fetch if stale\n2. Component unmounts ??? Query should become inactive after delay\n3. Component remounts within staleTime ??? Should not refetch\n4. Component remounts after staleTime ??? Should refetch\n5. Multiple components ??? Query stays active until all unmount\n6. Window focus within staleTime ??? Should not refetch\n7. Window focus after staleTime ??? Should refetch\n\n### Breaking Changes\n\nThis should be backwards compatible - existing behavior is preserved, but staleTime will now work correctly.",

Configuration UI Page\n\nPage should contain sections for each of the following:\n\n- LLM Settings: Provider, model, endpoint, api key, api version.\n\n- Vector Database: Provider selection (ChromaDB, PGVector, Qdrant) + connection settings (host, port, api key).\n\n- Graph Database: Provider selection (Neo4j, Kuzu, FalkorDB) + connection settings (host, port, username, password).\n\n- Processing: Chunk size, chunking strategy.\n\n- System: Data and system directory paths (Changing this is a destructive operation, meaning that system and data files should be deleted from the old paths and recreated at new paths)\n\n### 2. Backend API\n\nWe already have `api/v1/settings` GET and POST API routes that serve for getting and saving configurations.\n- Adapt existing API routes and expand DTO objects to support all required configuration fields.\n- Apply settings to active Cognee instance.\n\n### 3. UI Features\n\n- Validate settings on the backend and return meaningful error messages.\n\n- Test connections to databases and llm\n\n- Import/export configuration as JSON\n\n- Reset to defaults button",

Thanks! \uD83D\uDE4C\n\nHi @VinaySatrasala, thanks for showing the interest!\nTo answer your questions:\n1. Yes, that means in-memory reconfiguration. We don't want to persist it for now, because those contain sensitive information. Exporting and importing can help in case someone needs to restart cognee.\n2. This is editable through the UI. Most of the people will probably set it once and forget. I've put more info in the description, this is a destructive operation, if you change these settings you risk of losing the data.\n3. I wouldn't spend too much time on validation, except checking if the fields exist. We can have separate buttons that will trigger the connection testing, but we also need those endpoints then.", "Hi @Vasilije1990 \uD83D\uDC4B, sorry to bother again ??? I had one more doubt regarding the configuration setup:\n\nYou mentioned that we already have api/v1/settings GET and POST endpoints, and we should extend the DTO to support all configuration fields. Just to clarify:\n\nWould you prefer one consolidated API endpoint that handles the full configuration object (LLM, vector DB, graph DB, processing, and system settings all together)?\nOr is it acceptable (or even preferred) to expose separate endpoints for each configuration section (e.g., /settings/llm, /settings/vector-db, etc.) for modularity and separation of concerns?\n\nHappy to proceed either way ??? just wanted to align with your expectation before implementing.

Instead, I???d prefer using flags or environment variables to manage lightweight deployments.\n\nAs suggested in [issue #2052](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo/issues/2052), adopting Docker profiles could be a great solution. This approach would allow the demo to support multiple deployment ???modes??? in a cleaner and more flexible way.", "> The main challenge with using branches is maintainability\n\nYES!\n\nThe profiles is a great idea, but still we would need to make the services more configurable.\nVia env vars we must be able to specify if a service calls another or not", ">  Via env vars we must be able to specify if a service calls another or not\n\nThis would be a great addition, not only for a \"lighter\" demo, but also for contributing to and developing the demo. I sometimes struggle how to do small tweaks or changes to services without running the whole demo, especially for services with a high amount of down stream services (frontend, checkout, recommendation, etc.)\n\nOf course this should not be a default behavior, i.e. if the service is not available, the other service should still report errors or fail, but having a way to say \"run this without downstream service\" as an option would be great, e.g. looking at the recommendation service right now, what if I could set a `WITHOUT_PRODUCT_CATALOG` environment variable to `1` or `true` and insead of retrieving data from the product catalog service it simply uses some mock data.\n\nThis would also be a great \"first good issue\"/\"help wanted\" as it has a clear scope per service:-)", "I can have a look at this. I've already been investigating how to run the demo app on a machine with 8GB RAM or less and discussing this on Slack with @julianocosta89.

      "description" : "### Background\n\nTanStack Query provides robust error handling with retry logic, error callbacks, and error boundaries. While `query-db-collection` supports basic retry configuration, it doesn't fully expose Query's error handling capabilities. Currently, errors are logged to console and the collection is marked as ready, but the error details aren't easily accessible.\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nFrom query.ts:407-415:\n```typescript\n} else if (result.isError) {\n  console.error(\n    `[QueryCollection] Error observing query ${String(queryKey)}:`,\n    result.error\n  )\n  \n  // Mark collection as ready even on error to avoid blocking apps\n  markReady()\n}\n```\n\n### Problems\n\n1. **Limited error visibility**: Errors only go to console.error\n2. **No error callbacks**: Can't run custom logic on errors\n3. **Missing error state in utils**: No way to check last error\n4. **No error boundary integration**: Can't use React error boundaries\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nEnhance error handling to match TanStack Query's capabilities while respecting TanStack DB's design:\n\n```typescript\nexport interface QueryCollectionConfig<TItem, TError, TQueryKey> {\n  // ... existing options ...\n  \n  /**\n   * Callback when query encounters an error (after all retries)\n   * @param error - The error that occurred\n   * @param query - The query instance\n   */\n  onError?: (error: TError, query: Query) => void\n  \n  /**\n   * Callback when query settles (success or error)\n   * @param data - The data if successful\n   * @param error - The error if failed\n   */\n  onSettled?: (data?: Array<TItem>, error?: TError) => void\n  \n  /**\n   * Whether errors should be thrown to nearest error boundary\n   * @default false\n   */\n  useErrorBoundary?: boolean | ((error: TError, query: Query) => boolean)\n}\n\nexport interface QueryCollectionUtils<TItem, TKey, TInsertInput> {\n  // ... existing utils ...\n  \n  /**\n   * Get the last error encountered by the query (if any)\n   */\n  lastError: () => TError | undefined\n  \n  /**\n   * Check if the collection is in an error state\n   */\n  isError: () => boolean\n  \n  /**\n   * Get the number of consecutive sync failures\n   */\n  errorCount: () => number\n  \n  /**\n   * Clear the error state and retry\n   */\n  clearError: () => Promise<void>\n}\n```\n\n### Implementation Examples\n\n#### Example 1: Error Notification\n\n```typescript\nconst todoCollection = createCollection(\n  queryCollectionOptions({\n    queryKey: ['todos'],\n    queryFn: fetchTodos,\n    getKey: (item) => item.id,\n    \n    // Show toast on error\n    onError: (error) => {\n      toast.error(`Failed to load todos: ${error.message}`)\n    },\n    \n    // Log to monitoring service\n    onSettled: (data, error) => {\n      if (error) {\n        errorReporter.log(error, { collection: 'todos' })\n      }\n    },\n    \n    queryClient,\n  })\n)\n\n// In component\nconst { data } = useLiveQuery((q) => \n  q.from({ todo: todoCollection })\n)\n\nconst error = todoCollection.utils.lastError()\nif (error) {\n  return <ErrorMessage error={error} />\n}\n```\n\n#### Example 2: Error Boundary Integration\n\n```typescript\nconst criticalDataCollection = createCollection(\n  queryCollectionOptions({\n    queryKey: ['critical-data'],\n    queryFn: fetchCriticalData,\n    getKey: (item) => item.id,\n    \n    // Throw to error boundary for critical failures\n    useErrorBoundary: (error) => {\n      // Only throw for non-network errors\n      return error.code \\!== 'NETWORK_ERROR'\n    },\n    \n    queryClient,\n  })\n)\n\n// In React component with error boundary\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <ErrorBoundary fallback={<CriticalError />}>\n      <CriticalDataView />\n    </ErrorBoundary>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n#### Example 3: Offline-Aware Error Handling\n\n```typescript\nconst syncedCollection = createCollection(\n  queryCollectionOptions({\n    queryKey: ['synced-data'],\n    queryFn: fetchData,\n    getKey: (item) => item.id,\n    \n    onError: (error, query) => {\n      // Check if we have stale data to show\n      const hasStaleData = syncedCollection.size > 0\n      \n      if (navigator.onLine && \\!hasStaleData) {\n        // Online but failed - serious error\n        toast.error('Failed to load data')\n      } else if (\\!navigator.onLine && hasStaleData) {\n        // Offline but have cached data\n        toast.info('Showing offline data')\n      }\n    },\n    \n    queryClient,\n  })\n)\n\n// Component can check error state\nfunction DataList() {\n  const { data } = useLiveQuery((q) => q.from({ item: syncedCollection }))\n  const isError = syncedCollection.utils.isError()\n  const errorCount = syncedCollection.utils.errorCount()\n  \n  return (\n    <>\n      {isError && errorCount > 3 && (\n        <Alert>\n          Unable to sync. Showing cached data.\n          <button onClick={() => syncedCollection.utils.clearError()}>\n            Retry\n          </button>\n        </Alert>\n      )}\n      {/* Render data */}\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Technical Implementation\n\nUpdate the observer subscription to track errors:\n\n```typescript\n// In queryCollectionOptions\nlet lastError: TError | undefined\nlet errorCount = 0\n\nconst actualUnsubscribeFn = localObserver.subscribe((result) => {\n  if (result.isSuccess) {\n    // Clear error state on success\n    lastError = undefined\n    errorCount = 0\n    \n    // ... existing success logic ...\n    \n    // Call onSettled\n    config.onSettled?.(result.data, undefined)\n  } else if (result.isError) {\n    lastError = result.error\n    errorCount++\n    \n    // Call error callback\n    config.onError?.(result.error, localObserver.getCurrentQuery())\n    \n    // Call onSettled\n    config.onSettled?.(undefined, result.error)\n    \n    // Handle error boundary\n    if (config.useErrorBoundary) {\n      const shouldThrow = typeof config.useErrorBoundary === 'function'\n        ? config.useErrorBoundary(result.error, localObserver.getCurrentQuery())\n        : config.useErrorBoundary\n      \n      if (shouldThrow) {\n        throw result.error\n      }\n    }\n    \n    // Still mark ready to avoid blocking\n    markReady()\n  }\n})\n\n// Add to utils\nconst utils = {\n  refetch,\n  ...writeUtils,\n  lastError: () => lastError,\n  isError: () => \\!\\!lastError,\n  errorCount: () => errorCount,\n  clearError: async () => {\n    lastError = undefined\n    errorCount = 0\n    return refetch()\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Benefits\n\n1. **Better error visibility**: Errors accessible via utils, not just console\n2. **Custom error handling**: Run app-specific logic on errors\n3. **Error boundary support**: Integrate with React error boundaries\n4. **Offline resilience**: Build UIs that gracefully handle sync failures\n5. **Monitoring integration**: Easy to add error tracking\n\n### Design Considerations\n\n- **Data persistence**: Even with errors, preserve cached data when available\n- **Don't clear data on error**: Keep the collection state intact\n- **Progressive enhancement**: All error features are optional\n- **Retry friendly**: `clearError()` utility makes retry UX simple\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n1. Test onError callback is called with correct error\n2. Test onSettled is called for both success and error\n3. Test error boundary integration\n4. Test error state is accessible via utils functions\n5. Test clearError resets state and triggers refetch\n6. Test that collection still works with cached data despite errors",

      "url" : "https://github.com/TanStack/db/issues/346",
      "repositoryName" : "TanStack/db",
      "description" : "### Background\n\nTanStack Query provides several options for data initialization and transformation that are not currently exposed in `query-db-collection`. While TanStack DB has its own patterns (like live queries with `.select()`), some Query options would enhance the developer experience and provide feature parity.\n\n### Current State\n\n- **initialData**: Only supported in `localOnlyCollectionOptions`, not in `queryCollectionOptions`\n- **placeholderData**: Not supported\n- **structuralSharing**: Hard-coded to `true` in query.ts:320\n- **refetchOnWindowFocus/refetchOnReconnect**: Not configurable\n\n### Proposed Features\n\n#### 1. Initial Data Support\n\nAdd `initialData` option to `QueryCollectionConfig` for pre-populating collections:\n\n```typescript\nexport interface QueryCollectionConfig<TItem, TError, TQueryKey> {\n  // ... existing options ...\n  \n  /**\n   * Initial data to populate the collection before the first fetch\n   * Useful for SSR hydration or cached data from previous sessions\n   */\n  initialData?: Array<TItem> | (() => Array<TItem>)\n  \n  /**\n   * When the initial data was last updated (for staleness calculations)\n   */\n  initialDataUpdatedAt?: number | (() => number)\n}\n```\n\nImplementation approach:\n- Apply initial data before starting the query observer\n- Mark as synced data so it appears immediately in live queries\n- Let TanStack Query's staleness logic determine if refetch is needed\n\n#### 2. Structural Sharing Configuration\n\nAllow customizing how data updates are merged:\n\n```typescript\nexport interface QueryCollectionConfig<TItem, TError, TQueryKey> {\n  // ... existing options ...\n  \n  /**\n   * How to structurally share data between updates\n   * - true: Use TanStack Query's default structural sharing\n   * - false: Always use new references\n   * - function: Custom sharing logic\n   */\n  structuralSharing?: boolean | ((oldData: Array<TItem>, newData: Array<TItem>) => Array<TItem>)\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. Refetch Triggers\n\nExpose window focus and reconnect options:\n\n```typescript\nexport interface QueryCollectionConfig<TItem, TError, TQueryKey> {\n  // ... existing options ...\n  \n  /**\n   * Refetch on window focus\n   * @default true (when data is stale)\n   */\n  refetchOnWindowFocus?: boolean | ((query: Query) => boolean)\n  \n  /**\n   * Refetch on reconnect\n   * @default true (when data is stale)\n   */\n  refetchOnReconnect?: boolean | ((query: Query) => boolean)\n  \n  /**\n   * Network mode for offline behavior\n   * @default 'online'\n   */\n  networkMode?: 'online' | 'always' | 'offlineFirst'\n}\n```\n\n### Implementation Examples\n\n#### Example 1: SSR Hydration\n\n```typescript\n// Server-side: fetch and serialize initial data\nconst initialTodos = await fetchTodos()\n\n// Client-side: create collection with initial data\nconst todoCollection = createCollection(\n  queryCollectionOptions({\n    queryKey: ['todos'],\n    queryFn: fetchTodos,\n    getKey: (item) => item.id,\n    \n    // Hydrate with server data\n    initialData: initialTodos,\n    initialDataUpdatedAt: Date.now() - 60000, // 1 minute old\n    \n    // Keep using server data if fresh enough\n    staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes\n    \n    queryClient,\n  })\n)\n```\n\n#### Example 2: Offline-First Configuration\n\n```typescript\nconst offlineCollection = createCollection(\n  queryCollectionOptions({\n    queryKey: ['offline-data'],\n    queryFn: fetchData,\n    getKey: (item) => item.id,\n    \n    // Load from localStorage if available\n    initialData: () => {\n      const cached = localStorage.getItem('offline-data')\n      return cached ? JSON.parse(cached) : []\n    },\n    \n    // Don't refetch on focus if we have local data\n    refetchOnWindowFocus: false,\n    refetchOnReconnect: true,\n    \n    // Work offline-first\n    networkMode: 'offlineFirst',\n    \n    queryClient,\n  })\n)\n```\n\n#### Example 3: Custom Structural Sharing\n\n```typescript\nconst configCollection = createCollection(\n  queryCollectionOptions({\n    queryKey: ['config'],\n    queryFn: fetchConfig,\n    getKey: (item) => item.key,\n    \n    // Custom structural sharing to preserve references for unchanged config values\n    structuralSharing: (oldData, newData) => {\n      const result = [...newData]\n      const newMap = new Map(newData.map(item => [item.key, item]))\n      \n      // Reuse references for unchanged items\n      oldData.forEach((oldItem, index) => {\n        const newItem = newMap.get(oldItem.key)\n        if (newItem && deepEqual(oldItem, newItem)) {\n          result[index] = oldItem // Keep old reference\n        }\n      })\n      \n      return result\n    },\n    \n    queryClient,\n  })\n)\n```\n\n### Design Decisions\n\n#### Why Not `placeholderData`?\n\nPlaceholder data in TanStack Query shows temporary data while loading. In TanStack DB:\n- Collections can have `initialData` that persists\n- Live queries show loading states via `isLoading`/`isReady`\n- The local-first model means you often have real data to show\n\nIf needed, developers can implement placeholder UI at the component level.\n\n### Benefits\n\n1. **SSR Support**: Initial data enables server-side rendering hydration\n2. **Offline Capability**: Better control over offline behavior\n3. **Performance**: Custom structural sharing can optimize re-renders\n4. **Feature Parity**: Developers familiar with TanStack Query can use known patterns\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n1. Test initial data is properly synced to collection\n2. Test staleness calculations with initialDataUpdatedAt\n3. Test refetch triggers respect configuration\n4. Test custom structural sharing functions\n5. Test network mode behavior\n6. Test that initial data doesn't interfere with query observer\n\n### Migration Guide\n\nAll changes are backwards compatible. Existing collections continue to work with defaults:\n- `structuralSharing: true`\n- `refetchOnWindowFocus: true` (when stale)\n- `refetchOnReconnect: true` (when stale)\n- No initial data",

      "url" : "https://github.com/TanStack/db/issues/345",
      "repositoryName" : "TanStack/db",
      "description" : "### Background\n\nMany APIs return data wrapped in metadata (pagination info, timestamps, etc.). Currently, `query-db-collection` expects `queryFn` to return just the array of items. This forces developers to transform data in the queryFn, losing access to metadata.\n\n### Problem\n\n```typescript\n// API returns: { data: Todo[], total: number, page: number }\n// But collection needs: Todo[]\n\nconst todoCollection = createCollection(\n  queryCollectionOptions({\n    queryKey: ['todos'],\n    queryFn: async () => {\n      const response = await api.getTodos()\n      // Metadata is lost here\n      return response.data\n    },\n    getKey: (item) => item.id,\n    queryClient,\n  })\n)\n```\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nAdd a `select` option that extracts the item array from the query response:\n\n```typescript\nexport interface QueryCollectionConfig<\n  TItem extends object,\n  TError = unknown,\n  TQueryKey extends QueryKey = QueryKey,\n  TQueryData = unknown, // New generic for raw query data\n> {\n  // ... existing options ...\n  \n  /**\n   * Transform the query response to extract the items array\n   * @param data - The raw response from queryFn\n   * @returns The array of items for the collection\n   */\n  select?: (data: TQueryData) => Array<TItem>\n}\n```\n\n### Implementation Examples\n\n#### Example 1: Paginated API Response\n\n```typescript\ninterface PaginatedResponse<T> {\n  data: T[]\n  total: number\n  page: number\n  pageSize: number\n  hasMore: boolean\n}\n\nconst todoCollection = createCollection(\n  queryCollectionOptions({\n    queryKey: ['todos', { page: 1 }],\n    queryFn: async () => {\n      // Returns PaginatedResponse<Todo>\n      return api.getTodos({ page: 1, pageSize: 100 })\n    },\n    select: (response) => response.data, // Extract just the items\n    getKey: (item) => item.id,\n    queryClient,\n  })\n)\n\n// The full response is still cached by TanStack Query\n// Can access it via queryClient if needed:\nconst fullResponse = queryClient.getQueryData<PaginatedResponse<Todo>>(['todos', { page: 1 }])\nconsole.log(`Total items: ${fullResponse?.total}`)\n```\n\n#### Example 2: GraphQL Response\n\n```typescript\ninterface GraphQLResponse<T> {\n  data: T\n  errors?: Array<{ message: string }>\n}\n\ninterface TodosQuery {\n  todos: {\n    edges: Array<{ node: Todo }>\n    pageInfo: { hasNextPage: boolean }\n  }\n}\n\nconst todoCollection = createCollection(\n  queryCollectionOptions({\n    queryKey: ['todos-graphql'],\n    queryFn: async () => {\n      return graphqlClient.request<GraphQLResponse<TodosQuery>>(TODOS_QUERY)\n    },\n    select: (response) => {\n      // Extract and flatten the nodes\n      return response.data.todos.edges.map(edge => edge.node)\n    },\n    getKey: (item) => item.id,\n    queryClient,\n  })\n)\n```\n\n#### Example 3: API with Metadata\n\n```typescript\ninterface ApiResponse<T> {\n  result: T\n  metadata: {\n    timestamp: string\n    version: string\n    requestId: string\n  }\n}\n\nconst configCollection = createCollection(\n  queryCollectionOptions({\n    queryKey: ['config'],\n    queryFn: async (): Promise<ApiResponse<ConfigItem[]>> => {\n      return api.getConfig()\n    },\n    select: (response) => response.result,\n    getKey: (item) => item.key,\n    queryClient,\n    \n    // Can still access metadata in onUpdate\n    onUpdate: async ({ transaction }) => {\n      const response = await api.updateConfig(changes)\n      \n      // Log metadata for debugging\n      console.log('Update requestId:', response.metadata.requestId)\n      \n      return response\n    }\n  })\n)\n```\n\n### Technical Implementation\n\nIn the query observer callback:\n\n```typescript\nconst actualUnsubscribeFn = localObserver.subscribe((result) => {\n  if (result.isSuccess) {\n    // If select is provided, use it to extract items\n    const rawData = result.data\n    const newItemsArray = config.select \n      ? config.select(rawData)\n      : rawData\n    \n    // Continue with existing sync logic...\n    if (\\!Array.isArray(newItemsArray)) {\n      console.error('[QueryCollection] select function must return an array')\n      return\n    }\n    \n    // Rest of sync logic...\n  }\n})\n```\n\n### Benefits\n\n1. **Preserves metadata**: Full response stays in TanStack Query cache\n2. **Type safety**: Can type both the full response and extracted items\n3. **Flexibility**: Works with any API response shape\n4. **Familiar pattern**: Matches TanStack Query's `select` option\n5. **Debugging**: Can still access full response via QueryClient\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n1. Test that select properly extracts array from wrapped response\n2. Test error handling when select returns non-array\n3. Test that full response is cached in QueryClient\n4. Test type inference with select option\n5. Test that mutations still work correctly\n\n### Related Issue\n\nThis addresses #339",

      "repositoryName" : "TanStack/db",
      "description" : "### Background\n\nTanStack Query provides `invalidateQueries` to refresh multiple queries by pattern matching. Currently, `query-db-collection` only supports manual refetch per collection. This requires developers to import and call refetch on each related collection manually.\n\n### Problem\n\nWhen using multiple query collections, invalidating related queries requires boilerplate:\n\n```typescript\n// Current approach - manual coordination\nawait Promise.all([\n  todoCollection.utils.refetch(),\n  userStatsCollection.utils.refetch(),\n  projectSummaryCollection.utils.refetch()\n])\n```\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nAdd invalidation support specifically to `query-db-collection` by:\n\n1. Allowing collections to subscribe to invalidation events\n2. Pattern matching against the collection's queryKey\n3. Automatically calling refetch when matched\n\n### Implementation\n\n```typescript\n// Add to query-db-collection\nexport interface QueryCollectionConfig<TItem, TError, TQueryKey> {\n  // ... existing options ...\n}\n\n// In queryCollectionOptions implementation\nconst observerOptions = {\n  // ... existing options ...\n  // Subscribe to invalidation events\n  onInvalidate: () => {\n    // This is called by TanStack Query when invalidateQueries matches\n    refetch()\n  }\n}\n\n// The queryClient.invalidateQueries will work automatically\nqueryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['todos'] })\n// All collections with queryKey starting with ['todos'] will refetch\n```\n\n### Usage Example\n\n```typescript\n// Define collections\nconst todoCollection = createCollection(\n  queryCollectionOptions({\n    queryKey: ['todos', userId],\n    queryFn: fetchTodos,\n    getKey: (item) => item.id,\n    queryClient,\n  })\n)\n\nconst todoStatsCollection = createCollection(\n  queryCollectionOptions({\n    queryKey: ['todos', 'stats', userId],\n    queryFn: fetchTodoStats,\n    getKey: (item) => item.id,\n    queryClient,\n  })\n)\n\n// Later, invalidate all todo-related queries\nawait queryClient.invalidateQueries({ \n  queryKey: ['todos'] // Matches both collections\n})\n```\n\n### Benefits\n\n1. Works with existing TanStack Query invalidation patterns\n2. No new APIs to learn\n3. Leverages QueryClient's pattern matching\n4. Each collection manages its own invalidation response",

This may lead to situations where e.g. in PRs the CI are green, but new flaky tests get introduced, or existing tests got more flaky.\n\n## Goal\n\nTo avoid this we should increase visibility of flaky tests in PRs to make the author and reviewer more aware and ask them to check whether their PR contributes to the flakiness (and fix that if so). This could be done e.g. with in-place updated PRs comment(s) for flaky tests like demonstrated in https://github.com/camunda/camunda/pull/28834\n\nWe should aim to keep noise as low as possible.\n\n",

I decided to take an incremental and feedback-driven approach:\n\n??? **Current state:** Informational comments will be available, without blocking.\n\n??? **Observation period:** Over the next month, I will monitor how engineers interact with these comments, and start a thread at the end of the period to everyone bring their insights.\n\n\uD83D\uDD01 **Re-evaluation:** Based on that feedback, we???ll decide whether to:\n\n- Enforce blocking for new flaky tests,\n- Keep messaging as-is,\n- Highlight newly introduced flakiness & easily direct user to files with flaky tests \n- Or explore other options\n\nI've already set a reminder for next month to revisit this thread and assess how it???s going. \n~For now, I???ll keep this task open, since we still have an [ongoing discussion about the noisy caused by the comments.](https://github.com/camunda/camunda/pull/35780#issuecomment-3117863746)~\nAfter internal alignment, we've decided to take this [other approach](https://github.com/camunda/camunda/pull/35780#issuecomment-3127753493), although the overall plan described above remains unchanged.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  After a pre-implementation of the new approach producing an [aggregation summary of flaky tests](https://github.com/camunda/camunda/pull/36161#issuecomment-3133576512). We discovered that our current approach with `analyze-test-runs` doesn???t yield results when matrix jobs are involved. We are currently [discussing with the team](https://camunda.slack.com/archives/CHY2S7KDJ/p1753914211641289) solutions. A plan on what to do next should be outlined soon.\n\nThanks again, @cmur2 and @maxdanilov, for your support and for the insightful discussions!\n\n" ],

      "url" : "https://github.com/teemtee/tmt/issues/3769",
      "repositoryName" : "teemtee/tmt",
      "description" : "A couple of unit test files uses unittest's `TestCase` classes: besides the class being an extra namespace, and being implemented in different way tan the rest of codebase, there is an actual functionality issue with the setup/teardown methods since they cannot use pytest fixtures as easily as pytest fixtures:\n\n```python\nclass Foo(TestCase):\n    # Ends up with:\n    # E       TypeError: Foo.setUp() missing 1 required positional argument: 'tmppath'\n    def setUp(self, tmppath):\n```\n\nPytest can work with them, but the missing native support for fixtures creates a rift between these tests and the rest - a clear example is the \"create a temporary directory\" task: pytest offers the `tmpdir` fixture, which we wrap with a `tmppath` fixture to produce `Path` instances. Including `tmppath` or `tmppath_factory` as a parameter will not work. This opens the door to duplication of code, implementations in other files (`tempfile` can be found in 5 files under `tests/unit/`...), and different ways in which setup/teardown needs to be reasoned about in general, which I think is a bad idea.\n\nSo, I'd like to get rid of test classes. Current `tests/unit/test_id.py`:\n\n```python\nclass IdEmpty(TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        self.path = Path(tempfile.mkdtemp()) / \"empty\"\n        shutil.copytree(test_path / \"empty\", self.path)\n        self.original_directory = Path.cwd()\n        os.chdir(self.path)\n        self.base_tree = fmf.Tree(self.path)\n\n    def tearDown(self):\n        os.chdir(self.original_directory)\n        shutil.rmtree(self.path)\n\n    def test_base(self):\n        node = self.base_tree.find(\"/some/structure\")\n        test = tmt.Test(logger=root_logger, node=node)\n        assert test.id is None\n```\n\nPytest tends toward something like this:\n\n```python\n@pytest.fixture(name='empty_tree')\ndef fixture_empty_tree(tmppath: Path) -> fmf.Tree:\n    path = tmppath / \"empty\"\n    shutil.copytree(test_path / \"empty\", path)\n\n    original_directory = Path.cwd()\n    os.chdir(path)\n\n    try:\n        yield fmf.Tree(path)\n\n    finally:\n        os.chdir(original_directory)\n        shutil.rmtree(path)\n\n\ndef test_base(empty_tree: fmf.Tree):\n    node = empty_tree.find(\"/some/structure\")\n    test = tmt.Test(logger=root_logger, node=node)\n    assert test.id is None\n```",

I want implement formattable/printable concept once per type instead implementing it 3x times per type.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nTake `fmt::formattable` as base formatting concept. As AUI uses both GTest and {fmt}, implement GTest's `PrintTo` function and use `fmt::formattable` there.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_",

While the loop correctly appends individual partition details (`DiskDevice`) to the `d.DiskDevices` slice, the aggregation logic for the total system statistics (`d.Total`, `d.Used`, `d.Free`, `d.UsedPercent`) is flawed.\n\nhttps://github.com/kubeclipper/kubeclipper/blob/130c9a787bc7dbcf6927f23a94a676953034d5ef/pkg/utils/sysutil/sysutil.go#L165-L198\n\n**Problem:**\nInstead of accumulating the usage statistics (total, used, free space) across all partitions, the current implementation overwrites these aggregate values (`d.Total`, `d.Used`, `d.Free`, `d.UsedPercent`) in each iteration. Consequently, the final returned values for these fields reflect only the statistics of the *last partition* processed, not the sum totals for the entire system.\n\n**Impact:**\nThis results in incorrect overall disk usage reporting, which can mislead users or dependent systems about the actual disk space availability and utilization across the whole system.\n\n**Expected Behavior:**\nThe function should correctly sum the `Total`, `Used`, and `Free` bytes from all partitions and then calculate the overall `UsedPercent` based on these totals before returning the `Disk` struct.\n\n",

      "comments" : [ "Hi!\n\nI'm quite surprised that you reached the limits of Kafka by collecting events with OpenWEC. Out of curiosity, could you share an estimate of how many machines you are collecting events from and what your traffic is like (e.g. number of events, byte rate)?\n\nI don't understand how increasing the number of topics would improve performance (except if you have only one partition per topic). Could you share a documentation or an article stating about that? \n\nI would rather suggest to:\n- increase the number of partitions in your topic\n- increase the number of nodes in the Kafka cluster (at least one partition per node)\n- improve the storage technology used to store Kafka partitions (SSD)\n- tweak producer(s) configuration (batch size for example)\n- tweak consumer(s) configuration\n- tweak topic configuration (e.g. partition size, partition retention time)\n\n", "Hi! I am from Brian's team. We have 100k+ workstations and ~5500 servers that we going to collect from. \n\nIf there is a substantially huge volume on one single topic, it fills up the disk unevenly on a Kafka cluster.  This makes the team go into maintenance mode, rebalancing partitions which is tedious, sometimes error prone and time consuming all while hoping we don't miss realtime logs. So we have retention time and retention bytes applied to the partition. This keeps the busy work from us. But this means we need to monitor the volume and split the topic into more as they reach a certain level otherwise retention time criteria is not met.\nOur consumers scaling logic is shared across all log sources including wef. They all(300+) scale for up to 24 partitions so we don't have to handle scaling on case by case basis.\n\nSo we keep it fixed to 24 and make new topics if we reach more volume(message/sec) or more size(bytes/sec) than a number.\n\nLong story short, one could use 100s of partitions in Kafka on single topic if we are building a new system just to process windows events but after having tuned all other bits and pieces of the system, an ability to load balance across topics would make our life easier.\n\nForwarders like winlogbeats, logstash, etc. provide some sort of scripting and variable name for topic etc.. that we use to split volume to multiple topics. Does openwec has similar capability? Hoping we could work around.", "Thanks for the explanations! I'm very interested in knowing how you deployed OpenWEC and how it behaves with that type of charge. \n\n> Does openwec has similar capability?\n\nWe don't have that feature yet.\n\nAs you mentioned, if the Kafka driver configuration contains multiple topics, the expected behavior is for the received events to be distributed fairly among the configured topics. This behavior does not seem to be implemented in the Kafka producer library itself, so we need to implement it ourselves. However, the Kafka producer library can send each message (e.g., a Windows event) to a different topic.\n\nCurrently, the Kafka driver is stateless. This means that we cannot use a \"global\" round-robin index to fairly rotate between topics without making significant changes to the Kafka driver logic and possibly impacting performance. The Kafka driver, however, receives a batch of events to send in a single \"write\" call (https://github.com/cea-sec/openwec/blob/main/server/src/drivers/kafka.rs#L84). Therefore, I think we can use a \"local\" round-robin index to achieve relative fairness. The idea is to start at a random position in the topics array and iterate through the array for each event.\n\nI prefer your second proposal of adding a \"topics\" parameter to the Kafka driver configuration that contains a pre-made topics list. This approach seems much easier to understand and less likely to be used incorrectly. Additionally, if both \"topics\" and \"topic\" are present, an error should be raised.\n\nDoes this approach feel reasonable to you? It does not seem difficult to implement. Would you be interested in implementing it?", "Yes that would be perfect", "\"Would you be interested in implementing it?\" If you mean, would we be able to deploy and test in our environment; then yes, we can validate feature runs in a large-scale environment. ", "> \"Would you be interested in implementing it?\" If you mean, would we be able to deploy and test in our environment; then yes, we can validate feature runs in a large-scale environment.\n\nSorry, I meant writing the code ;)", "Hi @vruello, I'm also on Brian's team. Thank you for the recommendation, that does sound reasonable. I can write the code, though it'll be a few weeks before I can get to it." ],

It's possible to decrease the number of files by changing the  CompactionTableSize on LevelDB. The large amount of files has a negative impact on our IT infrastructure.\n\n## Describe the solution you'd like\nLevel DB has some parameters that can be tweaked, such as WriteBufferSize, BlockSize, BlockCacheCapacity, CompactionTableSize, CompactionL0Trigger, and OpenFilesCacheCapacity. These values should be configurable through the config file.\n\n## Describe alternatives you've considered\nI've tried running 'db dump', but it takes a long time to complete.\n\n## Additional context\nI've implemented this feature here, without any kind of test.\nhttps://github.com/linkd-academy/neo-go/commit/8ca4a311c01f7627967bf6fe818083b02271bb96\n\nResult with 5GB CompactionTableSize (may not be ideal, 1 GB could be better):\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22a82a69-87f7-41d0-8df1-c99428c9edff)\n\nChanging some parameters made it run faster on my macOS. My computer was barely usable during synchronization. \n\n## Don't forget to add labels!\n- `enhancement`",

Open a PR, and we'll review&merge eventually.", "Btw, boltdb also could also have some love.\nThere are `InitialMmapSize` and `AllocSize` which regulate how big the database is initially and how fast it grows.\nIt may be important, because to grow a database we need to remap it, and we cannot remap if there is an existing session iterator, so all transactions hang. I have reproduced it multiple times in privnet scenario with heavy iterator usage.\nWith these 2 settings the probability of such event can be made much smaller.\n\nneofs-node also used to configure `MaxBatchSize` and `MaxBatchDelay` but I have found them not that useful for neo-go." ],

      "description" : "In the [Performance Tips for Frontend Authors](https://llvm.org/docs/Frontend/PerformanceTips.html#avoid-creating-values-of-aggregate-type) section of the LLVM documentation the following suggestion is presented:\n\n> Avoid creating values of [aggregate types](https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#t-aggregate) (i.e. structs and arrays). In particular, avoid loading and storing them, or manipulating them with insertvalue and extractvalue instructions. Instead, only load and store individual fields of the aggregate.\n> There are some exceptions to this rule:\n>\n>    It is fine to use values of aggregate type in global variable initializers.\n>\n>    It is fine to return structs, if this is done to represent the return of multiple values in registers.\n>\n>    It is fine to work with structs returned by LLVM intrinsics, such as the with.overflow family of intrinsics.\n>\n>    It is fine to use aggregate types without creating values. For example, they are commonly used in getelementptr instructions or attributes like sret.\n\nThe goal of this issue is to evaluate the performance impact of the suggestion.  Specifically. when lowering hamiltonians, we first create an aggregate value and then store this aggregate value to an alloca pointer. We can avoid creating the aggregate value and store individual fields in the alloca pointer. In other words\n\n```mlir\nfunc.func @hamiltonian(%obs : !quantum.obs, %p1 : memref<1xf64>, %p2 : memref<3xf64>) {\n    quantum.hamiltonian(%p1 : memref<1xf64>) %obs : !quantum.obs\n    return\n}\n```\n\nProduces\n\n```mlir\nmodule {                                                                                      \n  llvm.func @__catalyst__qis__HamiltonianObs(!llvm.ptr, i64, ...) -> i64                                 \n  llvm.func @hamiltonian(%arg0: i64, %arg1: !llvm.ptr, %arg2: !llvm.ptr, %arg3: i64, %arg4: i64, %arg5: i64, %arg6: !llvm.ptr, %arg7: !llvm.ptr, %arg8: i64, %arg9: i64, %arg10: i64) {\n    %0 = llvm.mlir.constant(1 : i64) : i64                                                    \n    %1 = llvm.alloca %0 x !llvm.struct<(ptr, ptr, i64, array<1 x i64>, array<1 x i64>)> : (i64) -> !llvm.ptr\n    %2 = llvm.mlir.undef : !llvm.struct<(ptr, ptr, i64, array<1 x i64>, array<1 x i64>)>\n    %3 = llvm.insertvalue %arg1, %2[0] : !llvm.struct<(ptr, ptr, i64, array<1 x i64>, array<1 x i64>)>           \n    %4 = llvm.insertvalue %arg2, %3[1] : !llvm.struct<(ptr, ptr, i64, array<1 x i64>, array<1 x i64>)>\n    %5 = llvm.insertvalue %arg3, %4[2] : !llvm.struct<(ptr, ptr, i64, array<1 x i64>, array<1 x i64>)>     \n    %6 = llvm.insertvalue %arg4, %5[3, 0] : !llvm.struct<(ptr, ptr, i64, array<1 x i64>, array<1 x i64>)>\n    %7 = llvm.insertvalue %arg5, %6[4, 0] : !llvm.struct<(ptr, ptr, i64, array<1 x i64>, array<1 x i64>)>\n    %8 = llvm.mlir.constant(1 : i64) : i64\n    llvm.store %7, %1 : !llvm.struct<(ptr, ptr, i64, array<1 x i64>, array<1 x i64>)>, !llvm.ptr\n    %9 = llvm.call @__catalyst__qis__HamiltonianObs(%1, %8, %arg0) vararg(!llvm.func<i64 (ptr, i64, ...)>) : (!llvm.ptr, i64, i64) -> i64\n    llvm.return\n  } \n} \n```\n\nwhen we could produce:\n\n```mlir\nmodule {                                                                                      \n  llvm.func @__catalyst__qis__HamiltonianObs(!llvm.ptr, i64, ...) -> i64                                 \n  llvm.func @hamiltonian(%arg0: i64, %arg1: !llvm.ptr, %arg2: !llvm.ptr, %arg3: i64, %arg4: i64, %arg5: i64, %arg6: !llvm.ptr, %arg7: !llvm.ptr, %arg8: i64, %arg9: i64, %arg10: i64) {\n    %0 = llvm.mlir.constant(1 : i64) : i64                                                    \n    %1 = llvm.alloca %0 x !llvm.struct<(ptr, ptr, i64, array<1 x i64>, array<1 x i64>)> : (i64) -> !llvm.ptr\n    // get offsets with gep\n    // store values from args into gep\n    %9 = llvm.call @__catalyst__qis__HamiltonianObs(%1, %8, %arg0) vararg(!llvm.func<i64 (ptr, i64, ...)>) : (!llvm.ptr, i64, i64) -> i64\n    llvm.return\n  } \n} \n```\n\nCompletion of this issue should examine the following:\n1. Implement the suggested improvements to the `hamiltonian` function.\n2. Conduct a performance evaluation of the two versions of the `hamiltonian` function.\n3. Are the improvements suggested in Performance Tips for Frontend Authors](https://llvm.org/docs/Frontend/PerformanceTips.html#avoid-creating-values-of-aggregate-type) worthwhile in this situation?  Explain why or why not?\n4. On initial inspection it is not obvious that replacing the instances of `llvm.insertvalue` with  `llvm.store` instructions would result in a positive improvement.  If we find that it does in fact yield a speedup, why does it?  For example, are there downstream optimizations that LLVM applies?",

      "description" : "### Component(s)\n\nexporter/kafka\n\n### What happened?\n\n## Description\nAt the `kafkaexporter` is using `BaseExporter.TimeoutSettings` to set timeout for both Sarama and Franz produces.\nSee [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/exporter/kafkaexporter/kafka_exporter.go#L106) and [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/exporter/kafkaexporter/kafka_exporter.go#L119)\nThis approach works fine with the basic `kafkaexporter` usage with some defaults, for example using such config:\n```\n      kafka:\n        protocol_version: \"3.5.0\"\n        brokers:\n          - ...\n        timeout: 5s\n        producer:\n          max_message_bytes: 999999\n          flush_max_messages: 0\n          compression: gzip\n          required_acks: 1\n```\nIn this case internal `BaseExporter` pipeline will look like this:\n```\ntimeout_sender(5s) -> obs_report_sender -> kafka_client(with same timeout 5s)\n```\n\nBut, in case of usage of `BaseExporter.RetrySender` in pipeline configuration becomes unreliable.\nFor example, using such config:\n```\n      kafka:\n        protocol_version: \"3.5.0\"\n        brokers:\n          - ...\n        timeout: 5s\n        retry_on_failure:\n          enabled: true\n          initial_interval: 5s\n          max_interval: 10s\n          max_elapsed_time: 1m\n        producer:\n          max_message_bytes: 999999\n          flush_max_messages: 0\n          compression: gzip\n          required_acks: 1\n```\nIn this case internal `BaseExporter` pipeline will look like this:\n```\ntimeout_sender(5s) -> retry_sender(max timeout 1m) -> obs_report_sender -> kafka_client(with same timeout 5s)\n```\nAnd, obviously, `retry_sender` will not work correctly in this case as `timeout_sender` will stop pipeline in 5 seconds of timeout, while we expect to retry failures up to 1 minute.\nChanging `timeout` setting to `1m` will also change the timeout for Kafka Producer which is an unexpected change for this pipeline\n\nAlso this configuration approach does not allow to disable `timeout_sender` (by setting `timeout: 0`) because `Producer.Timeout` requires timeout to be non-zero\n\n## Expected Result\nExporter itself (BaseExporter) and Kafka Producer should have separate timeout configurations for proper exporter tuning in all allowed cases\n\n## Actual Result\nExporter itself (BaseExporter) and Kafka Producer are using same timeout configuration, which prevent correct work of `retry_sender`\n\n\n### Collector version\n\nv0.130.0\n\n### Tip\n\n<sub>[React](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) with \uD83D\uDC4D to help prioritize this issue.

Than I believe it should work as expected.\nThe only thing - we should adjust documentation than, because it doesn't reflect this code \"magic\" and confusing advanced users who are expecting this timeout to be for whole exporter\nSee https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/exporter/kafkaexporter/README.md?plain=1#L86", "Fair enough, I think we can clarify the documentation.\n\nThat was likely based on https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/exporter/exporterhelper/README.md#exporter-helper, which is a bit generic. We can probably make this clearer by stating that the timeout applies to a single attempt to produce to Kafka. Maybe:\n\n```yaml\n- `timeout` (default = 5s): Time to wait per individual attempt to produce data to Kafka.\n```\n\nIs that clear enough?", "PR for documentation clarification - #41704 " ],

To improve user engagement and transparency, more detailed and visual feedback should be implemented, breaking down the AI's progress into discernible steps.\n\n**Proposed Solution:**\n\n* **Granular Progress Messages:** Instead of a single generic message, display more specific textual updates corresponding to different stages of the AI process, such as:\n    * \"Analyzing prompt...\"\n    * \"Generating HTML structure...\"\n    * \"Creating CSS styles...\"\n    * \"Integrating JavaScript...\"\n    * \"Applying changes to preview...\"\n* **Progress Bar/Indicator:** Introduce a visual progress bar or a dynamic loading indicator that updates in real-time, reflecting the overall progress of the AI generation.\n* **Step-by-Step Visual Cues:** If feasible, consider visual cues that highlight which part of the process is currently active. For example, a small animation or a change in a status icon.\n* **Estimated Time (Optional):** Explore the possibility of displaying an estimated time remaining for complex generations, though this can be challenging to implement accurately with AI models.\n* **Completion Confirmation:** Provide a clear \"Generation Complete!\" message or a subtle animation upon successful completion, ensuring the user knows when the new content is ready.\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n* **Improved User Engagement:** Keeps users informed and reduces perceived waiting time by showing active progress.\n* **Increased Transparency:** Users gain a better understanding of what the AI is doing at each stage, demystifying the process.\n* **Reduced Frustration:** Prevents users from thinking the application has frozen or crashed during lengthy generation times.\n* **Professional Feel:** A refined loading experience contributes to a more polished and professional application.",

Currently, this is NOT aware of the difference of BibTeX and BibLaTeX.\n\n??? This is a good excercise to learn test-driven development and using a data model. This issue cannot be solved with an AI. You really have to think though BibTeX and BibLaTeX for yourself! Take this issue only if you are willing to invest significant time. ???\n\nExample: \n\n```bibtex\n@online{withDate,\n  date = {2025},\n  urldate = {2025-07-05}\n}\n\n@online{withoutDate,\n  urldate = {2025-07-05}\n}\n```\n\nIn BibTeX: Only `withDate`, field: `date` should be reported, because both entries take `urldate`.\n\nIn BibLaTeX: Only `withoutDate`, field: `date` (missing) should be reported, because required field `date` is missing.\n\n## Task\n\n- Modify `org.jabref.logic.quality.consistency.BibliographyConsistencyCheck` to use a complete `BibDatabaseContext` instead of a list of entries\n- Modify `org.jabref.logic.quality.consistency.BibliographyConsistencyCheck#check` to adhere the mode\n\n## Hints\n\n- Required fields of BibLaTeX `@online`: `org.jabref.model.entry.types.BiblatexEntryTypeDefinitions#ONLINE`\n- Get used to `org.jabref.model.entry.types.BibtexEntryTypeDefinitions` and `org.jabref.model.entry.types.BiblatexEntryTypeDefinitions`\n- One can get the required fields using `org.jabref.model.entry.BibEntryType#getRequiredFields`\n- Do test-driven development. Start with enabling `org.jabref.logic.quality.consistency.BibliographyConsistencyCheckTest#unsetFieldsReported` again.\n- Do not get confused with \"library\" and \"database\". User-facing we talk about \"library\", inside the code, we use \"database\", but mean \"library\".\n",

Run the program, build kv cache events, and check if the request scheduling results meet expectations?\nI'd like to take on this task.\n", "Hi @duyongtju - thank you for your interest. Right now we have E2E tests that only cover the in-memory index, and without KV-events. I think we want tests that cover the different configurations of the different components - not for performance but for correctness.\n\nE.g., it should cover the E2E pipeline with in-memory `kvblock.Index` as well as the redis one (in previous commits it was only Redis, but in a different schema).\n\nIf you can outline ideas or plan in here before execution it would be great.", "Hi @vMaroon - thanks for your guidance. Here???s my proposed approach for the E2E tests focusing on correctness across different configurations:\n\n1. Start the kv-cache-manager service to simulate the core scheduling environment.\n2. Mock multiple KV-cache events from different inference instances and write them into the message queue, ensuring these events carry distinct identifiers or prefixes for validation.\n3. Send a prompt request to the kv-cache-manager service, where the prompt shares the same prefix as some of the KV-cache events generated in step 2. Retrieve the scheduling result and verify if it matches the expected instance (based on the matching prefix logic).\n4. Mock KV-cache event deletion events to simulate scenarios where certain cache entries are invalidated.\n5. Send the same prompt request again to the kv-cache-manager service; the scheduling result should now point to another valid inference instance (since the original cache entry was deleted).\n\nThis test flow will be executed under both configurations: using the in-memory kvblock.Index and the Redis-based index (with proper handling of the updated schema to align with recent changes). The key is to validate that the entire pipeline behaves correctly in terms of event handling, scheduling logic, and configuration compatibility, rather than focusing on performance metrics.\n\nLet me know if this approach aligns with your expectations or if you???d like any adjustments!", "This sounds good. For preciseness, the scheduling logic is on a higher level (e.g., in the llm-d-inference-scheduler). In here the highest layer is the pod scoring (output of the `kvcache.Indexer.GetPodScores`), which maps pods -> number of blocks present. So testing should be based on that.\n\nOtherwise sounds good to go \uD83D\uDC4D\uD83C\uDFFB, thanks again for your interest!" ],

I was busy in the last days, but my plan is to return to it in the coming week. Thank you for your patience!", "No problem @ionixjunior take your time there is no rush", "@FilippoZazzeroni we have our first big challenge in this issue, and I'd like to suggest an approach.\n\nThe biggest function we have is `gleanRecordEvent` from `TelemetryWrapper.swift` which currently spans 982 lines. \n\nThis function contains a large switch case statement with a lot of marks (bookmarks, reader mode, reading list, etc). So, how about to start thinking to split this large switch case statement into small functions based on their marks. Example:\n\n```swift\nstatic func gleanRecordEvent(category: EventCategory,\n                             method: EventMethod,\n                             object: EventObject,\n                             value: EventValue? = nil,\n                             extras: [String: Any]? = nil) {\n    if (handleBookmarksActions(category: category, method: method, object: object, value: value, extras: extras)) { return }\n    if (handleReaderModeActions(category: category, method: method, object: object, value: value, extras: extras)) { return }\n    // other actions here...\n    \n    recordUninstrumentedMetrics(category: category, method: method, object: object, value: value, extras: extras)\n}\n\nprivate static func handleBookmarksActions(category: EventCategory,\n                                           method: EventMethod,\n                                           object: EventObject,\n                                           value: EventValue?,\n                                           extras: [String: Any]?) -> Bool {\n    switch (category, method, object, value, extras) {\n    case (.action, .view, .bookmarksPanel, let from?, _):\n        GleanMetrics.Bookmarks.viewList[from.rawValue].add()\n        return true\n    case (.action, .add, .bookmark, let from?, _):\n        GleanMetrics.Bookmarks.add[from.rawValue].add()\n        return true\n    case(.information, .view, .mobileBookmarks, .doesHaveMobileBookmarks, _):\n        GleanMetrics.Bookmarks.hasMobileBookmarks.set(true)\n        return true\n    case(.information, .view, .mobileBookmarks, .doesNotHaveMobileBookmarks, _):\n        GleanMetrics.Bookmarks.hasMobileBookmarks.set(false)\n        return true\n    case(.information, .view, .mobileBookmarks, .mobileBookmarksCount, let extras):\n        if let quantity = extras?[EventExtraKey.mobileBookmarksQuantity.rawValue] as?

Looking to this approach, a downside is allow duplicated switch case statements undetected by the compiler, and more complexity. What do you think?", "Hi @ionixjunior thanks for reaching out and digging into this. i believe we can just suppress the linter for this method, as this is legacy code and we are not updating it anymore. ", "@FilippoZazzeroni okay. The next big function is `update` from `BrowserSchema`. Currently, it span 362 lines. How about to think in an object-oriented approach? We can create a protocol to define a migration contract, and create a concrete implementation for each version implementing the protocol. In the `BrowserSchema`, we can register all migrations available, and in the `update` function we filter the migrations and run it. Of course, I'd like to start creating unit tests to ensure the correct behavior, before and after the implementation.\n\nWhat do you think about it?", "Hi @ionixjunior sorry for being late. I think we shouldn't modify the method too, as it seems really lighted and not updated i'd go to disable linter also for this one, what do u think ?" ],

Uses a `Proxy` to lazily wrap every *constructor* hanging off `Intl` (NumberFormat, DateTimeFormat, ???).\n// ??? Each wrapped constructor keeps an in???memory cache keyed by `[locales, options]` so that identical requests\n// reuse the same heavy instance instead of reparsing CLDR data every time.\n// ??? A polyfill warning for `Intl.DisplayNames` is emitted only once and only in dev.\n// ??? The public API is fully type???safe and mirrors the native `Intl` surface exactly ???\n// you can treat `CachedIntl` just like the built???in `Intl`.\n//\n// Usage examples:\n// ---------------\n// import { CachedIntl } from \"./cached-intl\";\n//\n// const nf = CachedIntl.NumberFormat(\"en-US\", { style: \"currency\", currency: \"USD\" });\n// console.log(nf.format(1234));\n//\n// const dn = CachedIntl.DisplayNames([\"fr\"], { type: \"language\" });\n// console.log(dn.of(\"en\")); // ??? \"anglais\"\n//\n// You can also spin up an isolated instance with its own caches (handy in test suites):\n// const TestIntl = createCachedIntl();\n//\n// ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nimport { LocalesValues } from '@intlayer/config';\nimport configuration from '@intlayer/config/built';\n\n// Helper type that picks just the constructor members off `typeof Intl`.\n// The \"capital???letter\" heuristic is 100 % accurate today and keeps the\n// mapping short???lived, so we don't have to manually list every constructor.\ntype IntlConstructors = {\n [K in keyof typeof Intl as (typeof Intl)[K] extends new (...args: any) => any\n ?

      "description" : "We???re improving how FastExcel documentation is organized. Currently, the raw documentation content is hosted in the [`[fastexcel-doc](https://github.com/CodePhiliaX/fastexcel-doc)`](https://github.com/CodePhiliaX/fastexcel-doc) repository. To make it more accessible for developers and users, we plan to **migrate this content to the main fastexcel repository** under the `docs/` directory.\n\nThis is a **Good First Issue**, perfect for new contributors to get started with the project.\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDCCC Background\n\nSome developers prefer to find documentation directly in the main project repository rather than in a separate one. As part of the ongoing effort to streamline our workflow, we are migrating content from `fastexcel-doc` into `fastexcel`.\n\n> ?????? **Note:** This is a temporary solution. We may evaluate launching a dedicated documentation website in the future.\n\n---\n\n### ??? What You Need to Do\n\n* Clone the [`[fastexcel-doc](https://github.com/CodePhiliaX/fastexcel-doc)`](https://github.com/CodePhiliaX/fastexcel-doc) repository.\n* Find the relevant documentation files (e.g., Markdown files, API documentation, or any other static content).\n* Move the content into this repository under the `docs/` directory.\n* Ensure that links are updated and the structure is appropriate after the migration.\n* Submit a Pull Request with a clear description of what content was migrated.\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDCA1 Contributor Guidelines\n\n* This can be done in stages: Feel free to submit multiple smaller PRs, one for each section or file.\n* If you???re unsure where to place the content or how to structure it, please feel free to ask questions here or in the PR discussion.\n* The priority is to retain the documentation content. Appearance can be handled later.\n* New contributors are welcome! If this is your first PR, we???re happy to assist you through the process.\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDE4B How to Contribute\n\n1. Comment below with **???I want to work on \\[specific content]???** to claim a part of the migration.\n2. Fork the [`[fastexcel](https://github.com/fast-excel/fastexcel)`](https://github.com/fast-excel/fastexcel) repository and create a new branch.\n3. Migrate the content and create a PR.\n4. Make sure to reference this issue in your PR description for tracking.\n\n---\n\n### Example PR (Reference)\n\nFor reference, check out [[PR #419](https://github.com/fast-excel/fastexcel/pull/419)](https://github.com/fast-excel/fastexcel/pull/419) which shows the format and structure for migrating the content.\n\n---\n\nWe???re excited to have you contribute to making FastExcel???s documentation more accessible and organized! Let???s improve the project together! \uD83D\uDE80\uD83D\uDCDA\n",

Let's take `AstBuilder` as an example.\n\nI think AI's capabilities could be improved in directly generating code rather than generating trees, as it's more trained on source code than abstract fields. Moreover, the incompatibility among ASTs is particularly annoying.\n\nSimilar to [`KermanX/js_to_oxc`](https://github.com/KermanX/js_to_oxc), we could enable AI to modify the code by writing the base code, thereby providing opportunities to retain elements from the code snippet that are awaiting rewriting.\n\nAnd one more thing: we would be better off isolating code generated by AI from code written by ourselves. This could be implemented seamlessly by assigning tasks that are better suited to AI, with more logically intensive tasks.\n\nTo make AI more capable of writing Rust, I believe the most critical task is to inform it of the latest APIs.

But as it goes in the name - insecure, is not the fine way.\n\nLooks like the authentication using key-pair is working and more secure. But there should be a way to work with user/password authentication.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nReconcile for Snowflake to Databricks using authentication by `sfPassword` to work.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nTo run reconcile for Snowflake to Databricks using authentication by `sfPassword`.\n\n### Relevant log output or Exception details\n\n```shell\n\n```\n\n### Sample Query\n\n```shell\n\n```\n\n### Operating System\n\nmacOS\n\n### Version\n\nlatest via Databricks CLI",

I haver to look closely why `insecureMode` did the trick\nI saw that you have opened other snowflake related issues that I am working on as well and will check this after I get them to main. \n\nmeanwhile any more logs, notes you have about this will be helpful\n\nThank you" ],

Something like\n\n```golang\ntype MCPService struct {\n\tdb             *gorm.DB\n\tmcpProxyServer *server.MCPServer\n\tlogger         *slog.Logger\n}\n```\n\nHowever this would require a change to the signature of the existing `NewMCPService` function. To address this I would also suggest using the Golang options pattern that would take a struct of options as the argument to the service initializer. To prevent a breaking change you could implement another function like `NewMCPServerWithOptions`, which is pretty common and idiomatic in Golang, and it appears you are already using that pattern in other places (like `internal/api/server.go`). That would look something like\n\n```golang\n// MCPServiceOptions holds the configuration options for the MCP service.\ntype MCPServiceOptions struct {\n\t// DB is the database connection used by the MCP service.\n\tDB *gorm.DB\n\t// MCPProxyServer is the MCP proxy server that handles tool registrations and requests.\n\tMCPProxyServer *server.MCPServer\n\t// Logger is the logger used by the MCP service.\n\tLogger *slog.Logger\n}\n\n// NewMCPServiceWithOptions will allow for more flexible initialization of the MCPService. By implementing\n// this separately from NewMCPService we can easily extend the functionality in the future without needing to change\n// the signature of the function.\nfunc NewMCPServiceWithOptions(options MCPServiceOptions) (*MCPService, error) {\n\ts := &MCPService{\n\t\tdb:             options.DB,\n\t\tmcpProxyServer: options.MCPProxyServer,\n\t\tlogger:         options.Logger,\n\t}\n\tif err := s.initMCPProxyServer(); err != nil {\n\t\treturn nil, fmt.Errorf(\"failed to initialize MCP proxy server: %w\", err)\n\t}\n\treturn s, nil\n}\n```\n\nIn this way you don't break anything, but it does cause a little code duplication (though given it's simplicity I think it would be okay). At this point it would just be implementing the logs as needed, but at least the hander is available. \n\nI would also suggest implement a similar pattern across all services (UserService, MCPProxyServer, ConfigService, etc.)." ],

The way it's presented (without indentation) led me to believe it was a top-level field of the Knn query. However, through testing, I realized `oversample` is actually a nested parameter under `rescore_vector`. \n\nThis lack of visual hierarchy in the documentation made it challenging to understand the query structure.\n\nHere???s a screenshot from the latest version of the docs showing how `rescore_vector` and `oversample` are currently displayed:\n\n<img width=\"2864\" height=\"1424\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/429d385a-6664-42c1-a26d-412172b372b3\" />\n\n### Additional info\n\n_No response_",

As mentioned in [this comment](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/pull/1685#discussion_r1922772245) we should add some supporting documention in Semantic Conventions to better document when cases can be handled in this manner.\n\ncc. @lmolkova ",

Although it removed the ORM stack trace from the logs, the authentication issue still persists.\n\nBased on the explanation in the PR, **we suspect the issue might be related to how the aws_connection is retrieved**. We store our AWS connection in the Airflow metadata database, and if the system using TaskSDK is no more able to initialised the ORM, it could be unable to access the metadata-database in the same time?\n\nHere are some tests we performed and their results:\n\nFrom the worker, we manually ran the token generation:\n\n```bash\npython3.12 -m airflow.providers.amazon.aws.utils.eks_get_token \\\n  --cluster-name CLUSTER \\\n  --region-name eu-central-1 \\\n  --aws-conn-id val_aws_assume_test\n```\n\nWe used the generated token to query the Kubernetes API:\n```bash\ncurl -s --header \"Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN\" \\\n     --insecure \\\n     \"$APISERVER/api/v1/namespaces/<YOUR_NAMESPACE>/pods?labelSelector=dag_id%3Dwoke_eks%2Ckubernetes_pod_operator%3DTrue%2Crun_id%3Dmanual__2025-07-18T134438.5412460000-53e546ffb%2Ctask_id%3Dexecute_k8s_eks_work%2Calready_checked%21%3DTrue%2C%21airflow-worker\"\n```\n??? This works as expected (so our connection and roles are correctly configured).\n\nHowever, when we export PYTHON_OPERATORS_VIRTUAL_ENV_MODE=1, the generated token is invalid and results in a 401 error.\n\nWe also tried blocking the temporary kubeconfig deletion to debug from the worker pod. During local testing with the kubeconfig, we faced multiple issues:\n\nunsupported API versions (alpha1)\n\nregex overmatch problems\n\nerrors when setting PYTHON_OPERATORS_VIRTUAL_ENV_MODE=1\n\nNone of these tests gave conclusive insights.

Check that no other contributor has already been assigned to this issue. If you believe that no one is actually working on it despite an assignment, ping the person. After one week without a response, the assignee may be changed.\n1. In the comments of this issue, request for it to be assigned to you, or just create a [pull request](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pulls) after following the steps below. [Mention](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) this issue in the description of the pull request.\n1. Fix the issue locally.\n1. [Run the test suite](https://llvm.org/docs/TestingGuide.html#unit-and-regression-tests) locally. Remember that the subdirectories under `test/` create fine-grained testing targets, so you can e.g. use `make check-clang-ast` to only run Clang's AST tests.\n1. Create a Git commit.\n1. Run [`git clang-format HEAD~1`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html#git-integration) to format your changes.\n1. Open a [pull request](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pulls) to the [upstream repository](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project) on GitHub.

In my opinion, on a target with fast multiplications (like almost all the current CPUs, even low power ones) CORDIC algorithms that might not use multiplications are only good for obtaining the first few bits.  After that Newton-Raphson is much more efficient to attain higher accuracy for the same number of iterations.  We use NR in our internal variable-length floating point division: https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/libc/src/__support/FPUtil/dyadic_float.h#L633\n\nFor fixed point, I could see us using a few NR iteration similar to sqrt: https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/libc/src/__support/fixed_point/sqrt.h#L168" ],

      "description" : "## Feature Description\n\nAs discussed [here](https://github.com/google/site-kit-wp/pull/10519/files#r2021312377), using `WithTestRegistry` while providing a callback alongside a set of features can lead to unexpected results, because the features won't be enabled until after the callback has executed.\n\nThis is illustrated with a contrived story in PR https://github.com/google/site-kit-wp/pull/10758, but as can be seen from the comment linked above it's something we've run into during active development.\n\nHowever - as mentioned below, https://github.com/google/site-kit-wp/issues/10757#issuecomment-2905270441, `WithTestRegistry` is an old component which has been superceded by `WithRegistrySetup` which doesn't exhibit this problem, and we should use `WithRegistrySetup` in our tests rather than `WithTestRegistry`.\n\n---------------\n\n_Do not alter or remove anything below. The following sections will be managed by moderators only._\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n\n* Use of `WithTestRegistry` should be replaced with `WithRegistrySetup` in our JS stories.\n* The `WithTestRegistry` function can be inlined directly in `preview.js` which is the one place it should still be used.\n\n## Implementation Brief\n\n* [ ] Update all stories which pass the `features` prop to `WithTestRegistry` to instead provide them via `{Story}.parameters.features`. This will ensure `enabledFeatures` is updated via [this default decorator](https://github.com/google/site-kit-wp/blob/6933097b64eaaeefc55003104935317c6c7496ff/storybook/preview.js#L68-L89) in `storybook/preview.js`.\n* [ ] Replace all usages of `WithTestRegistry` in stories with `WithRegistrySetup`.\n\n### Test Coverage\n\n* Ensure all stories are unchanged.\n* No new tests needed.\n\n## QA Brief\n\n* <!-- One or more bullet points for how to test that the feature works as expected. -->\n\n## Changelog entry\n\n* <!-- One sentence summarizing the PR, to be used in the changelog. -->\n",

All stories should use `WithRegistrySetup` instead which does not have the same issue since it does not create the registry, only hooks in to allow for changes before rendering its children. Since it uses the test registry created in `preview.js` where features should be properly applied before creation, I think the \"fix\" here may be better directed at refactoring Storybook to inline `WithTestRegistry` into `preview.js` and updating existing stories to use the `WithRegistrySetup` instead.", "Thanks @aaemnnosttv! I managed to completely forget about `WithRegistrySetup` when raising this issue.\n\nRemoving usage of `WithTestRegistry` from existing stories sounds like a sensible way forward here that will help avoid confusion in future.", "I've updated the AC, back to you @nfmohit for an update to the IB.", "@techanvil Based on my observation of the usage of `WithTestRegistry` (and `WithRegistrySetup`), it looks like they're used only on stories but not tests. Looking at Evan's comment, it also looks like we should be refactoring the stories instead of tests.\n\nDid you mean to refer to stories instead of tests in the ACs (also the issue title and description)?\n\nAssigning back to you in AC for confirmation, thank you!", "Thanks for the spot @nfmohit.

It's the simplest E2EE test. 910ms without encrypted DB, 4.86s with.\r\n - `TestFallbackKeyIsUsedIfOneTimeKeysRunOut` - this consumes all OTKs (blocking the client uploading more) then claims the fallback key, so it will cause the client to re-upload 50 OTKs. 2.52s without, 8.43s with.\r\n - Overall: 3m29s to run without, 9m28s to run with.\r\n\r\nThis is 3-5x worse.\r\n\r\nThis means I can't realistically enable encrypted DBs in tests, which is desirable in order to match EX.

      "description" : "- [x] I have checked that this issue has not already been reported.\r\n\r\n- [x] I have confirmed this bug exists on the latest version of pandas.\r\n\r\n- [x] (optional) I have confirmed this bug exists on the master branch of pandas.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Code Sample, a copy-pastable example\r\n\r\nHey--I noticed while running [siuba's](https://github.com/machow/siuba) SQL unit tests that queries using the modulo operator are failing.\r\n\r\nThe issue is due to a recent change for issue #34211 in pandas setting the [no_parameters](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blame/5507452c4a675ad5453bc5f02cd68b65fe3977df/pandas/io/sql.py#L1161) argument before executing via a sqlalchemy engine. This was done to allow queries like `SELECT 1 % 2`, but causes SqlAlchemy expressions handling `%` to not always work with `read_sql`.\r\n\r\n**Solution**. Rather than executing in a special way (`no_parameters`), I think you want to wrap a string query in SqlAlchemy.sql.text ([see here](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/tutorial.html#using-textual-sql)). This will allow both queries with `%` and the full range of SqlAlchemy expressions. WDYT?\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sqlalchemy import sql, create_engine\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\nengine = create_engine('postgresql://postgres:@localhost:5433/postgres', echo=False)\r\n#engine = create_engine('postgresql://USERNAME:PASSWORD@localhost:PORT/DBNAME', echo=False)\r\n\r\n# doesn't work, original issue in pandas: 'dict' object does not support indexing\r\nengine.execute(\"SELECT 1 % 2\")\r\n\r\n# works, ideal solution\r\nengine.execute(sql.text(\"SELECT 1 % 2\" ))\r\n\r\n# queries below broken by no_parameters change ----\r\npd.read_sql(sql.text(\"SELECT 1 % 2\"), engine)\r\n\r\npd.read_sql(sql.select([sql.literal(1) % sql.literal(2)]), engine)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's a gist of the error for the last two queries...\r\n\r\n```\r\nProgrammingError: (psycopg2.errors.UndefinedFunction) operator does not exist: integer %% integer\r\nLINE 1: SELECT 1 %% 2\r\n                 ^\r\nHINT:  No operator matches the given name and argument types.

Useful when scanning long DAG files to focus on relevant areas (e.g., `@task` decorators, `@asset` functions)\n\n### API Support  \n\n??? No\n\n- DAG source code is retrieved in full via the `/dagSource` endpoint.\n- No server-side support for search, diff, or section indexing currently exists.\n\n### UI Impact  \n\n- Text search input could be added above the code viewer, with inline highlighting.\n- A toggle for DAG version comparison could enable unified or split diff views.\n- Section filters could be implemented via regex (e.g., jump to task definitions) or indexing during parsing.\n\n### Notes  \n\n- Particularly helpful for large DAGs with many custom functions or inline logic\n- Would bring the UI experience closer to modern IDEs, improving developer ergonomics",

Allows users to locate all tasks using specific operators (e.g., identify all `PythonOperator` or `EmptyOperator` tasks)\n\n- Filter by **Task Retry Count**  \n  ??? Helps highlight tasks configured with aggressive or insufficient retry logic\n\n- Filter by **Trigger Rule**  \n  ??? Useful when investigating DAGs with conditional task paths or debugging why certain tasks did not run\n\n- Filter by **Mapped Task**  \n  ??? Enables focused inspection of mapped task behaviour\n\n- Filter by **Last Instance** Date Range  \n  ??? Helps identify recently active or stale tasks, which is useful when investigating changes in task behaviour over time\n\n### API Support  \n\n??? No\n\n- The API does not currently expose a queryable endpoint that returns task metadata with filtering support.\n- All task metadata is loaded client-side via DAG details and task instance history\n\n### UI Impact  \n\n- Filtering could be enabled above the task list panel\n- Would significantly improve UX in DAGs with dozens or hundreds of tasks (e.g., dynamic DAGs or map-heavy pipelines)\n\n### Notes  \n\n- These filters already reflect metadata displayed in the table (e.g., operator, trigger rule)\n- Would be particularly valuable when debugging DAGs with mapped tasks or unusual operator behaviour",

I've tried to hit REST endpoint and it seems to be up and running.\n@Siedlerchr @koppor is there a fetcher / mechanism in JabRef that downloads pdfs using REST api?\n[EDIT] OK, It looks like if we want to have possibility to download PDF from Wiley all we have to do is to create account for JabRef on TDM service and generate token. For test purposes I've generated one for myself and was able to download the pdf. Implementation should be simple - just create request with the token and mime type and perform GET. ", "@ankamde   you can simply use the UrlDownload class for such thing, it has a method addHeader\n\nRegarding the token, JabRef has the option to store such tokens in the preferences and use them (see. e.g. IEEE or Springer Fetcher to see how it's done=\n\n<img width=\"1130\" height=\"704\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81fa710a-a1b3-4dc4-abb3-0d30e053b670\" />", "Clarification: This Is a Feature Request, Not a Bug\n\nAfter reviewing the issue, I???d like to clarify that this is not a bug but a new requirement.\n\nCurrent Behavior\nThe application allows PDF downloads in two workflows:\n\n1. Search Full Text Documents Online\n2. Get Full Text (in the General tab)\n\nIn both cases, the system expects to:\n\n1. Download PDFs via direct URLs (simple HTTP GET)\n2. Store the PDF URL in the BibLaTeX url field\n\nWiley now provides an official REST API for Text and Data Mining (TDM):\nhttps://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/{DOI}\n\nThis API:\n\n1. Requires an API key\n2. Uses DOI-based queries\n3. Returns metadata and download links, not direct PDFs via simple URLs\n\nWhy This Is a Feature Request?\n\nCurrent System\n1. Handles direct PDF URLs\n2. Adds PDF URLs to url field BibLaTeX \n3. No authentication needed\n\nNew Requirement\n1. Needs REST API calls\n2. Wiley API URLs are not public/stable links\n3. Requires API key & headers\n\nAdditional Considerations\n\nThe Wiley API must be supported in both workflows:\n\n- Search Full Text Documents Online\n- Get Full Text (General tab)\n\nWiley REST API links should not be stored in url fields because:\n\n- They are temporary / protected API endpoints\n- They are not intended for bibliographic use\n- We can store direct link to pdf (but it won't be used to download) https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/we.2952 \n\nInstead, we should:\n\n1. Attach the downloaded PDF locally\n2. Retain the DOI as the main reference\n3. Optionally note that the PDF was retrieved via the Wiley API\n\nProposal\n\n1. Treat Wiley API integration as a new feature, not a bug fix\n2. Add Wiley REST API support as a special case\n3. Preserve current logic for other publishers (no changes to direct URL downloads)\n4. Avoid adding Wiley API URLs to BibLaTeX url fields\n\n@Siedlerchr @koppor Could you comment on my proposal, please?", "@ankamde It is very OK to treat that as feature. Regarding \"we should\": Steps 1 and 2 are the desired behavior, go ahead. Step 3 is not necessary; users typically don't care where a PDF is coming from, it just needs to be there." ],

It can lead to performance issues when big number of new series are ingested into VictoriaMetrics.\n\nThis feature allows to log all the new series created by the vmstorage or VM single-node. But in order to enable it the process **should be restarted**.  This complicates things in cluster deployments, as every restart (especially in the urge to find which series are hammering the installation right now) could result into re-routing and further degradation of performance.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nIt would be nice if vmstorage and VM single-node could support a hot-reload of this setting, that won't require a restart. For example, an API that could toggle on logging of new series during next minute should be sufficient enough for troubleshooting purposes.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_",

We need to expand the test suite to cover the TODO list feature, which is the only interactive functionality worth testing at this stage. Implement end-to-end tests using **Playwright** that cover the following scenarios:\n\n### 1. Opening and Closing the TODO List\n\n- [ ] Open the TODO list via UI (e.g. clicking a button).\n- [ ] Close the TODO list via UI.\n- [ ] Open/close the TODO list using keyboard shortcuts:\n  - [ ] Command palette (`Cmd/Ctrl + K`, then select \"Toggle TODO list\").\n  - [ ] Keyboard shortcut: `Shift + T + L`.\n\n### 2. Creating TODO Items\n\n- [ ] Add a new TODO item by clicking the \"New TODO\" button in the sidebar.\n- [ ] Add a new TODO item using keyboard:\n  - [ ] Command palette (`Cmd/Ctrl + K`, then select \"New TODO\").\n  - [ ] Keyboard shortcut: `Shift + T + N`.\n\n### 3. Creating Items with Various Fields\n\nEnsure creation works correctly for different input combinations:\n\n- [ ] Title only\n- [ ] Title + Description\n- [ ] Title + Priority\n- [ ] Title + Description + Priority\n- [ ] Other relevant field permutations\n\n### 4. Updating TODO Items\n\n- [ ] Update the title\n- [ ] Update the description\n- [ ] Change priority\n- [ ] Update various combinations of fields\n\n### 5. Completing / Uncompleting Items\n\n- [ ] Mark a TODO item as complete\n- [ ] Mark a completed item as incomplete\n\n### 6. Deleting Items\n\n- [ ] Delete a TODO item and verify it no longer appears in the list\n\n\n### Screenshots\n\n```bash\n![DESCRIPTION](LINK.png)\n```",

We would probably need to add a `mode` parameter to that error type in order to adapt the error messages to mention `__aenter__` instead of `__enter__` etc. Similar adaptations have been made for `IterationError` in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/19634\n* See existing tests for synchronous context managers: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/main/crates/ty_python_semantic/resources/mdtest/with/sync.md\n* The new tests should be added here: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/main/crates/ty_python_semantic/resources/mdtest/with/async.md\n* ",

For example:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"new_room_user_id\": \"@someuser:example.com\",\n    \"room_name\": \"Content Violation Notification\",\n    \"new_room_message_content\": {\n        \"body\": \"Hello, world!\",\n        \"formatted_body\": \"<h1>Hello, world!</h1>\",\n        \"msgtype\": \"m.text\",\n        \"format\": \"org.matrix.custom.html\"\n    },\n    \"block\": true,\n    \"purge\": true\n}\n```\n\nIf this field is set, it would override any content in `message`.\n\n## Development notes\n\nAs this is an entirely new field, the change is backwards-compatible and does not require a new v3 Room Delete Admin API. Since the v1 API is deprecated, I wouldn't add the new field there.\n\nBe sure to update any relevant documentation, and provide examples to help sysadmins.\n\nPlease add unit tests!" ],

Thank you for the callout @sergiimk \r\n\r\nI think this is a pretty good first issue for someone as the description is clear and the need is well defined. ", "take", "It seems hard to control the behavior of `write_parquet` by `single_file_output`(and I've noticed that It's never used), what really controls whether to generate a single file output is determining the suffix(in `start_demuxer_task()`), there are several methods I can think of to handle this issue:\r\n1. We can add a suffix like `.single` to the paths that require generating a single file, and then recognize this suffix in `start_demuxer_task()`.\r\n2. Give up `single_file_output` in `DataFrameWriteOptions`, use `FileSinkConfig` instead to control single file behavior.\r\n\r\ncc @alamb @sergiimk @dhegberg ", "Did some digging and found this old PR #9041 (cc @yyy1000) that seems to have removed `single_file_output` flag from `FileSinkConfig` - worth looking into it to understand the reasoning, not to undo the changes.\r\n\r\nLooking at v42 code it does indeed seem that `DataFrameWriteOptions::single_file_output` is not read anywhere and the logic relies on just this condition in demux:\r\n```rust\r\nlet single_file_output = !base_output_path.is_collection();\r\n```\r\nwhich in v43 became:\r\n```rust\r\nlet single_file_output = !base_output_path.is_collection() && base_output_path.file_extension().is_some();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `DataFrameWriteOptions::new().with_single_file_output(true)` is used in a bunch of tests though, so it's just a lucky coincidence that all tests give file a proper `test.parquet` name and not just `test`.\r\n\r\nPersonally I think that all kinds of extension-based heuristics don't belong in such low level code like `start_demuxer_task` and perhaps better left at the `DataFrame` level.\r\n\r\nWhichever heuristic version (pre v36, pre v43, or post v43) is the right one - I don't really mind, but I think there should be a way to skip it and specify explicitly.", "It seems that the previous PR intentionally removed the `single_file_output` option, but later introduced a heuristic.", "I feel like i reviewed a PR recently related to this issue but could not find it.

Given the title and description, I would have assumed than retrieving a 'plain' list of events to fully ignore would be sufficient? Do we foresee reasons to remotely disable events only for some specific channels/shippers?\r\n\r\nOn Cloud we have 2 shippers (and we're already in potential talks about LaunchDarkly), we may want to send some events only to specific shippers. I wouldn't like to design something that falls short in upcoming versions, especially since you can still disable it for all shippers if you like `{  \"event_types\": { \"my_event\": { \"enabled\": false } } }` although I reckon it makes the JSON response larger (hopefully the response is gzipped).\r\n\r\n> > Should this apply to EBT only? Or should we extend it to snapshot collectors?\r\n> \r\n> How would that work for snapshot collectors? would we retrieve a list of collector `type` to disable?\r\n\r\nYes! In this case, `event_type`, refers to the collector `type`. A list of strings would suffice here since we only send that type of telemetry to one endpoint. Although we may want to match the `OptInConfig` format for consistency if we think it's worth it.\r\n\r\n> > How to handle the initial state (external configuration not downloaded yet)? Can we assume an \"all-in\" in those cases?\r\n> \r\n> I'd say ignoring the remote config until resolved and just use the local config would probably be acceptable?\r\n\r\n++ makes sense to me.\r\n\r\n> > The first 2 inputs are based on a user decision and they should be prioritized. Should they though?\r\n> \r\n> Very good question, but as you said, the manual opt-in for audit purpose makes me think user configuration should be prioritized.\r\n\r\nYeah! Probably the `audit` shippers #132256 should just pass by any configuration and get all? OTOH, if we disabled it, it means we are not getting that piece of info, so the user shouldn't get it either to match our actual stream?\r\n\r\nI see the value of allowing them to see more than we actually see though (in case that stream is interesting to them for any reason)... just thinking out loud here...\r\n\r\nProbably, for the first iteration, we can take the approach of \"`disabled` (on any source) takes precedence over any other configuration\"? IMO, that's closer to the definition of `audit`.", "I don't want to take this thread off topic, but IMO we should hold off on implementing anything here until we understand a little more about the LaunchDarkly requirements (hopefully in the coming weeks).\r\n\r\nI've been hearing an increasing number of requests for remote Kibana configuration, including possibly for the LD integration, and I'm wondering if we should start thinking more seriously about a more generalized service for handling retrieval/caching/fallback of configuration values, rather than building something one-off just for EBT.

Useful when triaging DAGs across environments or viewing all runs for a specific DAG without switching views\n\n- Filter by **Run ID**\n  ??? Useful for debugging across views and linking from external systems or audit logs\n\n- Filter by **Start Date** \n  ???  Helps find DAG runs that started within a specific time window (e.g., peak load periods)\n\n- Filter by **End Date**\n  ??? Useful for spotting recently completed runs or identifying DAGs that finished during outages or incidents\n\n- Filter by **Duration Range**\n  ??? Identify slow or long-running DAGs to tune performance or spot issues with stuck tasks\n\n- Filter by **DAG Version** and/or **Bundle Version**\n  ??? Correlate failures or behavioral changes with code changes over time\n\n- Filter by **Conf Content**\n  ??? Search for runs where conf contains specific keys or values (e.g., for dynamic configuration or user-specific logic)\n\n- Filter by **Triggered By**\n  ??? Distinguish manual runs, asset-triggered runs, CLI-triggered runs, or other automated triggers; important in hybrid scheduling\n\n- Filter by **Producing Asset**\n  ??? Show runs created as a result of an upstream asset event, useful for event-driven DAGs and lineage debugging\n\n- Filter by **Logical Date ** or **Run After** (Range)\n  ??? Logical Date is the canonical ???execution date??? and is often used for backfill or partitioned logic; ???Run After??? helps with when something is scheduled to run, independent of the logical date\n\n### API Support  \n\n??????

In theory these could use different algorithms for performance and security(?) reasons.  If so, we could either have two metadata fields (`hash_algorithm` and `agg_hash_algorithm`), or better yet, rename `agg_tiles_hash` into `agg_tiles_hash_md5` (or other algo).

      "description" : "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\n\nPorting some code from `@aws-sdk/client-s3` we have a project that uploads both publicly available resources and private resources to a bucket. In our code this is easily managed by providing a pre-defined ACL value directly:\n\n```typescript\nimport { PutObjectCommand } from \"@aws-sdk/client-s3\";\nconst uploadParams = new PutObjectCommand({\n  ACL: \"public-read\", // ??? this part\n  Body: [?????? Buffer ??????],\n  Bucket: \"my-mixed-bucket\",\n  ContentType: \"text/plain\",\n  Key: \"my-file.txt\",\n});\n```\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nJust like with the Server-Side Encryption headers, it would be nice to be able to provide an ACL value directly to `S3mini#putObject()`. Preferably with the same strings supported as in `PutObjectCommand`.\n\nThe official AWS SDK supports strings they call Canned ACLs, predefined permissions. These seem to have some cross-platform support, as we are actually using Ceph ourselves and not S3. There are 6 possible values:\n\n```typescript\nexport declare const ObjectCannedACL: {\n    readonly authenticated_read: \"authenticated-read\";\n    readonly aws_exec_read: \"aws-exec-read\";\n    readonly bucket_owner_full_control: \"bucket-owner-full-control\";\n    readonly bucket_owner_read: \"bucket-owner-read\";\n    readonly private: \"private\";\n    readonly public_read: \"public-read\";\n    readonly public_read_write: \"public-read-write\";\n};\n```\n\nAnd these [are described in the Amazon S3 documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.html#canned-acl).\n\nIt looks like the Canned ACL value can be passed directly as [an `x-amz-acl` header](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutObject.html#AmazonS3-PutObject-request-header-ACL).\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\nAn alternative solution would be to allow a much more open-ended / generic ???headers??? argument on the `S3mini#putObject`-method. But I like how explicit the current class is with what can and cannot be set.",

I will be able to test Ceph once I am back from vacation, as we have OpenStack infrastructure with Ceph as our main object storage there. I just do not have access to that right now.\n\n> regarding the argument - I am not 100% sure. Intuitively, I would not mess it with SSECHeaders but at the same time I would keep the args more \"abstact\"/useful ... is it necessary to add add em inside signature hashing as well?\n\nFrom how I understand [creating signed requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_sigv-create-signed-request.html) all `x-amz-*` headers should be included as CanonicalHeaders and SignedHeaders? So it sounds like the answer will be _yes_.\n\nThere are [so many possible `x-amz-*` headers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutObject.html#API_PutObject_RequestSyntax) that I do not think add separate arguments for each to `S3mini#putObject` makes too much sense. But I do understand the preference of keeping `SSECHeaders` separate as it needs to be provided to other methods besides `putObject` as well.\n\nMaybe a more generic final argument?\n\n```typescript\ntype AwsHeaders = { [k: `x-amz-${string}`]: string };\n```" ],

To enhance the user experience and make the app visually more appealing, contributors can improve the UI design and styling.\n\nOne approach is to use Streamlit's built-in theming via the .streamlit/config.toml file. However, contributors may also explore other improvements such as using st.markdown() with custom CSS, layout tweaks, or better font and color choices. Can use any other method/way too.\n\nUse your creativity to design a clean, modern, and visually consistent look. Ensure good contrast and readability, and feel free to experiment with any color palette, theme, or layout style that fits the app???s purpose.",

I???m a complete rookie and recently started exploring the Meshery project because I???m eager to learn and contribute. While browsing the [[Extensions page](https://meshery.io/extensions)](https://meshery.io/extensions), I noticed that **???KUBECTL PLUGIN FOR KANVAS SNAPSHOT???** and **???KUBECTL PLUGIN FOR MESHSYNC SNAPSHOT???** appear as additional extension blocks that aren???t yet fully fleshed out. I thought these might be great areas for me to try contributing!\n\nI tried experimenting by pasting in a bit of frontend code to add one of the cards:\n\n```tsx\n<ExtensionCard\n  title=\"KUBECTL PLUGIN FOR KANVAS SNAPSHOT\"\n  description=\"Experimental plugin support\"\n  icon=\"/static/img/kanvas_snapshot.svg\"\n  url=\"/kanvas-snapshot\"\n/>\n\n```\n\nThen I ran:\n\n```bash\nmake ui-build\nmake build-server\n\n```\n\nBut when I restarted and visited the app, I ended up on this screen (attached screenshot) saying I don???t have the necessary permissions. I'm guessing it's either because I ran only part of the stack or something else is missing in my local setup.\n\nAlso, I couldn't find the SVG assets for those two new blocks. Are these available somewhere? Or should I use placeholders for now? Thanks so much for your help ??? and apologies if this is super basic. I'm still figuring things out cause I'm super new to coding, thanks a lot!!" ],

      "description" : "### Description\n\nIt's Tuesday, July 29, 2025, and I'm ready to provide 10 suggestions for improving the `apache/airflow` GitHub README, keeping in mind its significant role as a leading orchestrator.\n\n---\n\nHere are 10 suggestions to improve the `apache/airflow` GitHub README, making it more informative, engaging, and helpful for new and experienced users alike:\n\n1.  ### **More Engaging and Concise Tagline/Hero Statement:**\n    * **Current State:** The opening is functional but could be more impactful.\n    * **Suggestion:** Start with a stronger, benefit-oriented statement. For example: \"Apache Airflow is a platform to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows. **Design, schedule, and monitor your data pipelines with confidence, at any scale.** Airflow's extensible Python-based framework empowers data engineers to build robust and scalable ETL/ELT, ML pipelines, and more.\"\n    * **Why:** Immediately tells visitors what Airflow is and its core value proposition in a compelling way.\n\n2.  ### **Prominent \"Quick Start\" for Local Setup:**\n    * **Current State:** Installation instructions are present but might not be the absolute *quickest* path to a running instance for evaluation.\n    * **Suggestion:** Create a highly visible \"Quick Start\" section right after the main description. This should provide the absolute minimum commands to get a local Airflow instance (e.g., using Docker Compose with the official example YAML) up and running quickly for testing/evaluation.\n        * **Example:** \"To spin up a local Airflow environment for evaluation in minutes, use Docker Compose: `curl -LfO 'https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/docker-compose.yaml'` then `docker compose up airflow-init && docker compose up -d`.\"\n    * **Why:** Lowers the barrier to entry for new users wanting to quickly test-drive Airflow without a full production setup.\n\n3.  ### **Visual Showcase: Compelling UI Screenshot/GIF:**\n    * **Current State:** No immediate visual of the Airflow UI.\n    * **Suggestion:** Include a high-quality screenshot or, even better, a short animated GIF of the Airflow UI dashboard, a running DAGs view, or the Graph View. Focus on showcasing its intuitiveness and monitoring capabilities.\n    * **Why:** Airflow's web UI is a major strength. A strong visual immediately communicates its monitoring and management capabilities.\n\n4.  ### **\"Key Concepts\" Primer:**\n    * **Current State:** Assumes some familiarity with concepts like DAGs, Operators, Sensors, etc.\n    * **Suggestion:** Add a small \"Key Concepts\" section that briefly defines 3-5 fundamental Airflow terms (DAG, Operator, Task, Task Instance, Scheduler). Use simple, one-sentence definitions.\n    * **Why:** Helps newcomers grasp the core terminology essential for understanding Airflow's documentation and code examples.\n\n5.  ### **Real-World Use Cases (Concise Bullet Points):**\n    * **Current State:** The broad applications are understood but not explicitly listed in a \"use cases\" section.\n    * **Suggestion:** Create a \"Common Use Cases\" section with short, impactful bullet points:\n        * \"Building reliable ETL/ELT pipelines for data warehousing.\"\n        * \"Orchestrating machine learning workflows from data ingestion to model deployment.\"\n        * \"Automating infrastructure provisioning and cloud resource management.\"\n        * \"Managing complex data transformations and analytical jobs.\"\n        * \"Scheduling batch jobs and data synchronization tasks.\"\n    * **Why:** Helps potential users quickly identify if Airflow is the right solution for their specific problems.\n\n6.  ### **Highlight Key Features with Benefits:**\n    * **Current State:** Features are inherent to the description but could be more explicitly listed.\n    * **Suggestion:** Expand on a \"Features\" section using bullet points, emphasizing the *benefits* or *what they enable*:\n        * **Programmatic Workflows:** \"Define complex workflows as Python code, enabling version control, testing, and collaboration.\"\n        * **Dynamic DAG Generation:** \"Generate DAGs on the fly, ideal for handling hundreds or thousands of similar pipelines.\"\n        * **Rich UI & Monitoring:** \"Intuitive web interface for monitoring, managing, and troubleshooting pipelines in real-time.\"\n        * **Scalability & Extensibility:** \"Built to scale from small jobs to massive data pipelines, with a vast ecosystem of operators and integrations.\"\n        * **Idempotent Retries & Backfills:** \"Robust error handling with automatic retries, customizable SLAs, and the ability to re-run historical data.\"\n        * **Pluggable Executors:** \"Support for local, Celery, Kubernetes, and other executors for diverse deployment needs.\"\n    * **Why:** Clearly articulates Airflow's strengths and capabilities in a scannable format.\n\n7.  ### **\"Where to Find Help / Get Involved\" Section:**\n    * **Current State:** Links to documentation and community resources are on the website.\n    * **Suggestion:** Centralize community resources directly in the README.\n        * \"Official Documentation\": Prominent link to `airflow.apache.org/docs`.\n        * \"Mailing Lists\": Links to `users@airflow.apache.org` and `dev@airflow.apache.org`.\n        * \"Apache Airflow Slack\": Link to the Slack workspace for live discussions.\n        * \"Issue Tracker\": Link to Jira (or GitHub Issues if that's the primary, but Apache projects often use Jira).\n        * \"Contributing Guide\": Direct link to `CONTRIBUTING.rst` (or `.md`) and a friendly encouragement.\n    * **Why:** Makes it easy for users to find support and for potential contributors to engage with the community.\n\n8.  ### **Emphasize Python-centricity & Extensibility:**\n    * **Current State:** Implied, but could be more explicit.\n    * **Suggestion:** Add a brief point about its Python-first approach and how easy it is to extend. \"Built entirely in Python, Airflow allows data engineers to leverage their existing Python skills to define, extend, and interact with workflows. Develop custom operators, sensors, and hooks with ease to integrate with any system.\"\n    * **Why:** Highlights a core advantage for the vast Python community.\n\n9.  ### **Clear Versioning and Compatibility Statement:**\n    * **Current State:** The release notes cover this.\n    * **Suggestion:** Add a small \"Versioning & Compatibility\" section. Briefly mention what Airflow versions are supported, and perhaps key Python version compatibility. \"Apache Airflow follows semantic versioning. For detailed compatibility matrices (Python, database, etc.), please refer to our official documentation.\"\n    * **Why:** Helps users quickly understand supported environments and upgrade paths.\n\n10. ### **\"Powered By\" / Case Studies Section (if public):**\n    * **Current State:** Not directly in the README.\n    * **Suggestion:** If there are publicly available major companies or projects that use Airflow and are willing to be mentioned, include a \"Powered By\" section with logos or short, approved testimonials. Link to more extensive case studies on the official website.\n    * **Why:** Provides strong social proof and demonstrates real-world enterprise adoption, building trust.\n\n---\n\nThese suggestions aim to make the Apache Airflow README a more comprehensive, visually appealing, and user-friendly entry point, guiding visitors efficiently from curiosity to confident adoption and contribution.\n\n### Use case/motivation\n\n_No response_\n\n### Related issues\n\n_No response_\n\n### Are you willing to submit a PR?\n\n- [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n",

      "description" : "## Summary\n\nThis issue tracks the removal of ESLint suppressions for the `no-throw-error/no-throw-error` rule in the `@liam-hq/erd-core` package.\n\n## Context\n\nPR #2442 introduced a custom ESLint rule that prohibits `throw new Error()` statements and encourages the use of neverthrow Result types instead. To enable incremental adoption, bulk suppressions were applied to existing violations.\n\n## Task\n\nReplace all `throw new Error()` statements in the `frontend/packages/erd-core/` directory with neverthrow Result types (`err`, `ok`, `ResultAsync`) imported from \"neverthrow\".\n\n## Files to update\n\n- `frontend/packages/erd-core/eslint-suppressions.json` - Contains 22 suppressed violations\n\n## Steps\n\n1. Review the suppressed violations in `frontend/packages/erd-core/eslint-suppressions.json`\n2. Replace `throw new Error()` statements with appropriate neverthrow Result types\n3. Import neverthrow types: `import { err, ok, ResultAsync } from \"neverthrow\"`\n4. Update function return types to use `Result<T, E>` or `ResultAsync<T, E>`\n5. Update calling code to handle Result types appropriately\n6. Run `pnpm lint:eslint --prune-suppressions` to update eslint-suppressions.json after modifications\n7. Verify all suppressions are resolved\n\n## Related\n\n- Resolves: #2442",

Open this link to live example: [Demo from docs on stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/r9drhjmw?file=src%2FDemo.tsx,src%2Findex.tsx)\n2. Change variant of columnInputProps to 'standard' and save\n3.

If I can't overwrite the default, it's not really a customization \uD83D\uDE05\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI would expect if change the value of variant to another valid variant value like 'standard', it should resembles this change in the ui. \n\n### Context\n\nCurrently the DataGridPro in our application has the variant 'standard' for all input/select fields in the filter panel.

In nereids, the key of partition prune is in `PartitionPruner.java`. you should read it and understand its details completely. the key function is `canBePrunedOut`.\npartition prune is the most difficult part of this task. you should understand what https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/38025 did. it will be very helpful.\n\n### Are you willing to submit PR?\n\n- [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct)\n",

However, I have some suggestions regarding modifications to partition pruning. \n\n1. For single-column partitions, we can simply use the column value itself as the partition identifier and apply the partitionPredicate to the partition identifier column during pruning. \n2. For multi-column partitions, we can use a `List<a, b, ...>` as the partition identifier, and during pruning, pass a corresponding `List<Pred1, Pred2, ...>`, using two nested for loops for pruning: the outer loop iterates over the partition identifier columns, and the inner loop applies the predicates Pred to each element of the partition identifier list. \n\nAnother question I have is whether the current design addresses this???When pruning for an SQL statement like `WHERE colA=xxx AND colB=xxx`, does the partitionPredicate passed in accurately match the columns used in partitioning, rather than passing all predicates from the SQL statement and comparing them one by one." ],

This will give users visibility into their past actions and help track engagement and progress.\n\n---\n\n### \uD83E\uDDE9 **Why This Feature?**\n\n* Improves user experience by showing transparency on what they???ve done so far\n* Helps users recall actions like:\n\n  * Modules started/completed\n  * Projects viewed/applied for\n  * Resume generated\n  * Profile edited\n  * Feedback submitted\n\n---\n\n### \uD83C\uDF10 **Frontend Requirements**\n\n* **Page Location**: Add under the `User Profile` tab (maybe a new `Activity` or `History` tab)\n* **Components to Include**:\n\n  * Timeline-style log view or table format\n  * Icons + timestamps\n  * Filters (e.g., last 7 days, only project-related, only learning actions)\n* **Libraries Suggested**:\n\n  * `react-icons` for icons\n  * `shadcn/ui` or `Headless UI` for dropdowns/tabs\n* **UI Design**:\n\n  * Responsive layout\n  * Dark mode support\n  * Optional: Add hover tooltips or colored tags for different activity types\n\n---\n\n### \uD83E\uDDEA **Backend Requirements**\n\n* **Model**: Create an `ActivityLog` schema in MongoDB\n\n```js\n// model/ActivityLog.js\n{\n  userId: ObjectId,\n  type: String, // 'Login', 'Project_Apply', 'Resume_Gen', etc.\n  description: String,\n  timestamp: Date\n}\n```\n\n* **Controller**:\n\n  * `POST /api/v1/activity` ??? To log a new activity\n  * `GET /api/v1/activity/user/:id` ??? To fetch activity logs by user\n* **Middleware**: Add logic to log activity from:\n\n  * Login/signup\n  * Resume generation\n  * Project applications\n  * Module completions\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDD10 **Authentication**\n\n* Only **authenticated users** can view their own history\n* Admins may optionally view logs for all users\n\n---\n\n### ??? **Expected Output**\n\n* A fully functional **Activity Log** page under Profile\n* All logs stored securely in the database\n* Realtime or recent activity visible immediately after action\n\n\n\nThis keeps the project clean \uD83E\uDDF9, updated \uD83D\uDD04, and easier to merge! ???\n\n---\n\n\uD83D\uDCAC Looking forward to your *amazing contributions* \uD83D\uDCBB ??? let???s build something truly impactful together! \uD83D\uDE80\uD83D\uDD25\n\n???

I???ve understood the requirements:\n- Add a new Activity tab in the user profile\n- Design a responsive UI (timeline/table view) with filters and icons\n- Connect to backend MongoDB using an ActivityLog model\n- Create API routes for logging and fetching activity\n- Support role-based access (user vs admin)\n\nI'm comfortable with both frontend and backend, and I???m excited to work on this full-stack feature!\n\nKindly assign this to me if it's available. Looking forward to contributing! \uD83D\uDE80\n\nThanks!\n", "\uD83D\uDD16 Proposal for Issue #166: Add an Activity Log / History Section under User Profile\nGitHub Issue Reference: #166\nTitle: \uD83D\uDCD8 Add an Activity Log / History Section under User Profile\nContributor: @Devnil434\nRole: Full Stack Developer | Open Source Enthusiast\nTech Stack Expertise: Next.js, MongoDB, Tailwind CSS, Express.js, shadcn/ui, Prisma\n\n\uD83D\uDCCC Why I???m Interested\nI???d love to work on this feature because it not only enhances transparency and engagement for the user but also aligns well with my skill set in building scalable full-stack apps using the technologies used in DevElevate (MongoDB, Express, Next.js, Tailwind). I???ve already gone through the existing codebase and understood the current user profile structure, API routes, and component layout.\n\n\uD83D\uDD28 My Plan of Action (Step-by-Step)\n??? Step 1: Frontend UI Implementation\nAdd new tab named Activity under the User Profile dashboard layout.\n\nUse shadcn/ui Tabs and Table or Timeline layout to display activity logs.\n\nInclude:\n\nIcons (via react-icons)\n\nTime-based filtering (Dropdown UI for ???Last 7 days???, ???Projects only???, etc.)\n\nResponsive design with dark mode support\n\nOptional: Add colored tags for activity type (e.g., #Resume, #Login)\n\n??? Step 2: Backend Implementation\nCreate a MongoDB schema:\n\njs\nCopy\nEdit\n{\n  userId: ObjectId,\n  type: String, // 'Login', 'Resume_Gen', etc.\n  description: String,\n  timestamp: Date\n}\nImplement REST API endpoints:\n\nPOST /api/v1/activity ??? For logging an activity\n\nGET /api/v1/activity/user/:id ??? For fetching user activity\n\nSecure both routes with authentication middleware (users can only view their own logs).\n\n??? Step 3: Middleware Integration\nHook activity logger middleware into:\n\nLogin/Signup success\n\nResume generation\n\nProject apply\n\nModule completion\n\n??? Step 4: Testing & Deployment\nWrite unit and integration tests for the new API routes.\n\nEnsure proper error handling and loading states.\n\nTest on Vercel + Render (current deployment setup).\n\n\uD83D\uDD10 Authentication & Access\nEnsure only authenticated users can access their logs.\n\nAdmins may access all logs for moderation or analytics.\n\n\uD83D\uDCE6 Deliverables\nFully functional Activity Log page under User Profile.\n\nBackend logging and retrieval integrated.\n\nUI fully responsive and user-friendly with dark mode.\n\nPR following your contribution guidelines, with clean commits and documentation.\n\n???

      "description" : "This issue is about supporting **Hume TTS** provider.\nUpvote this issue with \uD83D\uDC4D to priotize it.\n\n### Contributor\nYou'd want to implement this provider? Here are a few things you need to know:\n\n1. All TTS providers are located under `packages/life/models/tts/providers/`. Feel free to use existing providers as inspiration.\n2. Each provider class implements the `TTSBase` class from `packages/life/models/tts/base.ts`.\n3. In the same file, each provider also exports its own configuration schema.\n4. Once your class and schema are ready, register them in `packages/life/models/tts/index.ts`.\n5. If your provider adds any new NPM dependencies, list them under `peerDependencies` in `packages/life/package.json`.\n6. Finally, all providers are documented at `apps/website/content/docs/configuration/models`.\n\n\nIf you encounter any blocker, or have any question, feel free to ping me on this issue, or on Discord.\nMy username is `@LilaRest` on both platforms.\n\nAnd most importantly, thanks for contributing to Life.js \uD83E\uDDE1\n\n### Useful links\nHere are a few AI-surfaced links about Hume TTS that might be helpful:\n\n- https://dev.hume.ai/docs/text-to-speech-tts/introduction\n- https://dev.hume.ai/docs/sdks/typescript-sdk\n- https://dev.hume.ai/docs/text-to-speech-tts/api-reference\n- https://docs.hume.ai\n",

Go to the Resume or CV builder in dark mode.\n2. Hover over any of the section buttons (like \"Skills\", \"Projects\", etc.).\n3.

Write a brief description of how you will approach the task (without using ChatGPT).\n3. Add your Telegram handler in your application (e.g., in OnlyDust or similar)\n4. Write ETA in your application\n\n\n\n## What should I do if I have a problem\n1. Try to google it before asking. Googling is taking major part of dev work \n2. If you couldn't find answer your question with Google, text your question to [dev](https://t.me/spotnet_dev/4) group with your question.\n3. Do not send DM to maintainer, it would be better and faster to ask other contributors in chat \n\n\n## How to prepare PR\n1. Check if your code [smell](https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/smells) good\n2. Add `close #<issue number>` to link your issue with your PR\n3. Do not commit changes that are unrelated to your task\n4. Check after you created PR, if you committed everything\n\n\n## Task Description\n1. In the [handlers folder](./blob/main/margin/margin_app/app/telegram/handlers), create a new file named `admin.py`. Inside, add a handler called `/assets`. Use the [`Admin Filter` from this issue](https://github.com/djeck1432/spotnet/issues/915) to verify the user is an admin. Then, call the [`Assets statistic` method from this issue](https://github.com/djeck1432/spotnet/issues/906) to retrieve the data. Format the response using Telegram Markdown so it displays neatly.\n2. Provide a screenshot demonstrating that the handler works as expected.\n",

Seems you have \"playlist_autoplay\" settings set to false and the video you are trying to watch is in a playlist according to what you've shown. You can toggle that in the \"playlist\" settings in the extension. Might be why it only happens sometimes for you. I also found that since brave sets videos to not auto play by default that it can sometimes mess with the playback with this extension, and I found adding a hotkey in the extension settings \"shortcut\" menu for the \"toggle autoplay\" option works for those instances. That's about the extent of my knowledge and what it might be. And if none of those work, then someone else here with more knowledge might be able to fix it.

This is a crucial aspect of developing reliable and maintainable data pipelines. Providing clear guidelines and examples can significantly help users in implementing effective testing practices.\r\n\r\n### Task Description\r\nDevelop a comprehensive documentation page or guide on how to perform unit tests on ZenML steps. The documentation should include tips, best practices, and examples. The [test steps directory of FuzzyLabs' MindGPT project](https://github.com/fuzzylabs/MindGPT/tree/develop/tests/test_steps) can be used as a reference model to showcase practical implementations of unit tests in ZenML.\r\n\r\n### Expected Outcome\r\n- A detailed documentation page or section dedicated to unit testing ZenML steps. [The 'pipelining features' section](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/docs/book/user-guide/advanced-guide/pipelining-features) would probably be the most logical location for this page to live.\r\n- Update [the table of contents](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/blob/main/docs/book/toc.md) to include the new documentation page\r\n- Inclusion of examples and best practices, with FuzzyLabs' approach serving as a key reference.\r\n- The documentation should be accessible and understandable for users at different levels of expertise with testing.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Implement\r\n- Research and compile best practices for unit testing in the context of ZenML steps.\r\n- Review the FuzzyLabs' MindGPT project's approach to testing ZenML steps for insights and practical examples.\r\n- Write a comprehensive guide that includes step-by-step instructions, code examples, and explanations.\r\n- Ensure that the documentation covers various scenarios and common challenges in unit testing ZenML steps.\r\n- Review and edit the documentation for clarity, accuracy, and ease of understanding.\r\n- Publish the guide in an appropriate section of the ZenML documentation.\r\n\r\n### Additional Context\r\nThis documentation will be a valuable resource for ZenML users, helping to ensure the quality and reliability of their data pipelines. It will also foster best practices in testing within the ZenML community.\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n- [ ] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct",

This causes a conflict with the status message \"the fields ingressClassName and class cannot be set at the same time\" and fail to create an Ingress resource to solve the HTTP01 challenge.\r\n\r\nStripped-down/redacted example of the Challenge resource created by cert-manager:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\napiVersion: acme.cert-manager.io/v1\r\nkind: Challenge\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: testingress-tls-xxxxx-000000000-1111111111\r\n  namespace: acmetest\r\nspec:\r\n  authorizationURL: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/acme/authz-v3/00000000000\r\n  dnsName: testingress.example.com\r\n  issuerRef:\r\n    group: cert-manager.io\r\n    kind: ClusterIssuer\r\n    name: my-clusterissuer\r\n  key: >-\r\n    xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.....\r\n  solver:\r\n    http01:\r\n      ingress:\r\n        class: nginx\r\n        ingressClassName: nginx\r\n  token: yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy.....\r\n  type: HTTP-01\r\n  url: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/acme/chall-v3/00000000000/xxxxxx\r\n  wildcard: false\r\nstatus:\r\n  presented: false\r\n  processing: true\r\n  reason: the fields ingressClassName and class cannot be set at the same time\r\n  state: pending\r\n```\r\n\r\nSetting the old-style `...http01.ingress.class` attribute on the Issuer's solver spec instead of `ingressClassName` avoids the issue and works as expected, but will create challenge solver ingresses with the legacy class annotation instead of the modern ingressClassName spec.\r\n\r\n**Expected behaviour**:\r\n- Either there should be a separate, new and well documented annotation for Ingresses to override the `ingressClassName` instead of the `class` attribute of a Challenge, e.g. something like `acme.cert-manager.io/http01-ingress-ingressclassname`,\r\n- or cert-manager should automatically figure out, based on the configuration of a solver, which type of configuration is set as default, and convert the class name set via Ingress annotation as necessary to replace that default, instead of adding a duplicate/conflicting attribute.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the bug**:\r\n\r\nStripped-down app ingress manifest:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\napiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1\r\nkind: Ingress\r\nmetadata:\r\n  annotations:\r\n    acme.cert-manager.io/http01-ingress-class: nginx\r\n    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: my-clusterissuer\r\n  name: testingress\r\n  namespace: acmetest\r\nspec:\r\n  ingressClassName: nginx\r\n  rules:\r\n    - host: testingress.example.com\r\n      http:\r\n        paths: [] # ...\r\n  tls:\r\n    - hosts:\r\n        - testingress.example.com\r\n      secretName: testingress-tls\r\n```\r\n\r\nStripped-down ClusterIssuer manifest:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\napiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1\r\nkind: ClusterIssuer\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: dico-clusterissuer\r\nspec:\r\n  acme:\r\n    # ...\r\n    solvers:\r\n      - http01:\r\n          ingress:\r\n            ingressClassName: nginx\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**:\r\n\r\nThis relates to the new `http01.ingress.ingressClassName` solver spec attribute which got introduced in the recent v1.15 cert-manager version. It's not a regression, but a bug or a missing part with the new feature.\r\n\r\n**Environment details:**:\r\n- Kubernetes version: 1.24.10\r\n- Cloud-provider/provisioner: Azure/AKS\r\n- cert-manager version: v1.12.1\r\n- Install method: official Helm chart\r\n\r\n/kind bug\r\n",

You need an access to airflow DB itself for it.", "Hi @valentinDruzhinin, just following up ??? how are we progressing on this issue?", "Hi @vatsrahul1001 . I'm trying to catch this issue but unsuccessfully. Please unassign me from this issue, maybe someone else can catch the error and fix it. Sorry for that.\n", "Issue summary:\n1. Create a DAG with a parsing error inside files/dags/{file_name}.\n2. Wait for the bundle sync (~3???4 mins), then open the Airflow UI/reload the web interface.\n3. The UI highlights a parsing error using data from the `import_errors` table.\n4. Now delete the faulty DAG file without fixing the error.\n5. The error still shows up in the UI even though the file no longer exists.\n\nWhy is this happening ?\nThe issue lies in the `_refresh_dag_bundles` method of `DagFileProcessorManager`.\nThis condition skips bundle refresh.\n```\nif (\n    elapsed_time_since_refresh < bundle.refresh_interval\n    and current_version_matches_db\n    and previously_seen\n    and bundle.name not in self._force_refresh_bundles\n):\n    self.log.info(\"Not time to refresh bundle %s\", bundle.name)\n    continue\n```\nSo if the DAG file was deleted, but the above condition is still True, the bundle isn???t refreshed and import_errors aren???t cleared. The error disappears only after the condition eventually fails and the bundle is refreshed.\n\nAdditionally, since the frontend relies on manual reloads and has no real-time update mechanism, users keep seeing stale error messages until they refresh the page after the backend has synced.\n\nPossible Fixes:\n1. Lift the orphan cleanup logic\nMove up this logic so it runs regardless of the bundle refresh skip:\n```\nfound_files = {\n    DagFileInfo(rel_path=p, bundle_name=bundle.name, bundle_path=bundle.path)\n    for p in self._find_files_in_bundle(bundle)\n}\nknown_files[bundle.name] = found_files\n\nself.clear_orphaned_import_errors(\n    bundle_name=bundle.name,\n    observed_filelocs={str(x.rel_path) for x in found_files},\n)\n```\nThis ensures that when a DAG file is deleted, its corresponding `import_error` entries are also cleared.\n\n2. Lower refresh_interval\nReduce the `dag_processor.refresh_interval` to trigger syncs more frequently.\n\n3. Make `is_stale` column atomic:\nCurrently, the `is_stale` column in the dag table is overloaded - it tracks both deleted DAG files and parsing errors. We should make `is_stale` track only deletions and rely on `has_import_errors` for parse failures. This separation would make the DB state clearer and reduce ambiguity. Once done, the Get Import Errors API can also be tweaked to exclude entries related to deleted files.\n\n4. Event-driven UI updates\nImprove the frontend to automatically refresh when the backend updates bundle state instead of relying on manual reloads.\n\n@vatsrahul1001 @uranusjr  Let me know how we want to proceed so that I can go ahead and implement the fix.", "You???ll need to change the `found_files` structure a bit since the refresh time check is before the loop. But you also can???t simply calculate all bundle files eagerly since it???d require refreshing all the bundles first, and that could be costly.\n\nHonestly I don???t feel this is too worthwhile to fix. This is just a temporary glitch. Maybe somewhere down the line we can allow each dag bundle to set its refresh interval instead???and a bundle that???s cheap to refresh, such as a local directory, can simply set it very low, even 0.", "> Honestly I don???t feel this is too worthwhile to fix. This is just a temporary glitch. Maybe somewhere down the line we can allow each dag bundle to set its refresh interval instead???and a bundle that???s cheap to refresh, such as a local directory, can simply set it very low, even 0.\n\nThat's the plan of AIP-66 which still needs to be completed https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=294816356\n\nBut maybe a good (and simple) solution will be to have a possibility to \"clear\" all import errors - regardless where they are coming from ? For those Dags that are still there and have import errors, they will soon re-appear, but for deleted once, they will not.\n\nI think that could be a very simple fix without real side-effects.", "@potiuk Just to clarify - the entries for deleted DAGs do get cleared when the bundle is refreshed. The issue happens only when the bundle refresh is skipped (due to to the if condition shared above), so it's more of a temporary inconsistency ??? as @uranusjr  pointed out.\n\nSince AIP-66 already aims to give finer control over refresh intervals (which would help fix this more systematically), maybe we can consider not addressing this right now unless it becomes a problem in actual usage.\n\nYour suggestion to provide a ???clear all import errors??? action (maybe via UI or CLI) is interesting. It could act as a manual override for now, but I???d be slightly cautious since it may also clear real errors from active DAGs temporarily. So if we do go this route, maybe it???s worth scoping it to only orphaned errors (i.e., for files that no longer exist) ?\n\nLet me know how you'd like me to proceed. Happy to help either way.", "Yeah. Fine for me to wait if this works like you described " ],

On the python side, input backed symbols need to be generated for the autotune block. This is to prepare for one-pass AOTI CUDA codegen.\"\n \nLogic moved from [`codegen_inputs`](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/d7a5ec9355b367ebbe2538f90f40702b49a093bb/torch/_inductor/codegen/wrapper.py#L1680) into [`codegen_input_symbol_assignment`](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/d7a5ec9355b367ebbe2538f90f40702b49a093bb/torch/_inductor/codegen/wrapper.py#L1638) through the call:\n\n```python\nfor name, value in inputs:\n    self.codegen_input_symbol_assignment(name, value, bound_vars)\n```\n[Link to call site](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/d7a5ec9355b367ebbe2538f90f40702b49a093bb/torch/_inductor/codegen/wrapper.py#L1694)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe original logic was not removed, but refactored by PR #141965 into `codegen_input_symbol_assignment`. The tensor inspection code still exists as its required for autotune:\n\n```python\nelif isinstance(value, ir.TensorBox):\n    for dim, size in enumerate(value.get_size()):  \n        if isinstance(size, sympy.Symbol) and size not in bound_vars:\n            code.writeline(f\"{size} = {sizeof(name)}[{dim}]\") \n```\n\n<br><br><br>\n\nDoes any further action need to be taken here?\n" ],

In my opinion, having troops cost money really slows gameplay down and discourages purchasing improvements.\n\nWhen purchasing troops to refill reserves, unlike the current behavior of gifting troops, you will receive a short burst of \"recruitment\", where population growth is increased but the new population will be troops. This quick burst tapers off in some sort of logarithmic fashion.\n\nThe larger the investment, the more aggressive your burst of reserves.\n\nThe above is just an idea and not the intended solution to this issue. However this can be something we can think about as a follow-up.\n\nI won't bog down this issue with meta and gameplay discussion just yet, let's just see how the game plays in testing with this defaulted distribution when everyone needs only to worry about troop count.", "I really think that adapting troops/worker ratio during a match is a crucial part of a player strategy . \nPlease dont remove it.\nIMHO it would be better to show a button to hide it + config hide / show by default, and keyboard shortcut (hide + adapt ratio)", " @dolie I agree, we definitely wont remove the ability for you to change the ratio, however we do want to make it easier for the majority of players who don't change it often, and to make it easier for mobile players to do the same as desktop players. As of right now, I have a solution that will toggle you between three different \"balances\".\n\nYou do make a good point, that removing a UI element, no matter how \"much\" we think is used, can be detrimental. \n\nI'll look to add an option in user settings (defaulted off) that will toggle the slider's visibility, so that those that do wish to min-max their ratios, can do so.", "Worker/troop trade-off feels like a good idea, but the UI slider feels like a bad UI for it: the percentage is rarely the immediate thing users care about. With the current mechanics it feels like the controls should be a list of options: optimize for money with minimal troop count compared to neighbors, optimize for defence, optimize for offence, etc." ],

However, we need to either improve the current approach or use something else. The main problem is that in the case we  make a big change (e.g. refactor) we should always be careful with the metrics and we should make sure we keep their order. Especially the last one is challenging, due to the hard-coded string values. An alternative would be to register timestamp with a specific name, instead of `TS[0-9][0-9]` that we currently use. However, even in that case, we will need a way to identify the order of the timestamps.",

      "description" : "### Context\n\n[JIT Emitters](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/emitters/README.md) are part of code generation feature (a.k.a. tensor compiler) that automatically produces highly-efficient optimized fused subgraph binary code. Each emitter implements specific operation from low level OpenVINO dialect.\n\n### Prerequisites\nDue to limited resources, cross compilation is preferred option now for building OpenVINO targeting RISC-V development boards. Please see the documentation [\"Cross compile OpenVINO??? Runtime for RISCV64 systems\"](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/docs/dev/build_riscv64.md) for more details. For this work, you need to build [`xuantie-gnu-toolchain`](https://github.com/XUANTIE-RV/) or [`riscv-gnu-toolchain`](https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain.git) with `QEMU` support for emulation. So you don't need to have RISC-V development board even to contribute to OpenVINO for these platforms \uD83D\uDE03 \n\n### What needs to be done?\n\n* Create `fp32` [Round](https://docs.openvino.ai/2025/documentation/openvino-ir-format/operation-sets/operation-specs/arithmetic/round-5.html) operation [JIT Emitter](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/emitters/plugin/riscv64/jit_eltwise_emitters.hpp) for RISCV64 platform with RVV1.0 support. Use OpenVINO [CPU plugin JIT emitters](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/emitters/README.md) documentation and [RISC-V \"V\" Vector Extension](https://github.com/riscvarchive/riscv-v-spec/releases/tag/v1.0) documentation for details.\n* Support your implemented JIT Emitter in the [JIT Executor](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/4ebe493140b90cbaaa68e2c71fe8e1dbd7461822/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/nodes/eltwise.cpp#L805).\n* Modify [RISCV64 kernel](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/4ebe493140b90cbaaa68e2c71fe8e1dbd7461822/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/nodes/kernels/riscv64/jit_uni_eltwise_generic.hpp#L19) (in both places: [create_eltwise_emitter](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/4ebe493140b90cbaaa68e2c71fe8e1dbd7461822/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/nodes/kernels/riscv64/jit_uni_eltwise_generic.cpp#L401) and [get_supported_precisions](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/4ebe493140b90cbaaa68e2c71fe8e1dbd7461822/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/nodes/kernels/riscv64/jit_uni_eltwise_generic.cpp#L528)) to apply developed JIT emitter.\n\nBefore emitter implementation, please, modify tests to be sure that developed functionality is covered by test:\n * Add `jit` kernel check in [activation](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/0a177ff48a7197bee7eeb08f4e81b9d0ce8db271/src/plugins/intel_cpu/tests/functional/custom/single_layer_tests/classes/activation.cpp#L229) test, the test must fail.\n* If test doesn't fail then add supported operation in [CPU activation test instantiation](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/0a177ff48a7197bee7eeb08f4e81b9d0ce8db271/src/plugins/intel_cpu/tests/functional/custom/single_layer_tests/classes/activation.cpp#L263) if it's absent.\n\n### Tests\nTests are disabled in default build, so ensure to add `-DENABLE_TESTS=ON` into cmake command during the project configuration.\n\n[GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest) is used for testing. CPU functional test target is [ov_cpu_func_tests](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/tree/master/src/plugins/intel_cpu/tests/functional). You can use `GoogleTest` filter:\n```sh\n# If you use xuantie-gnu-toolchain:\n<xuantie_install_path>/bin/qemu-riscv64 -cpu rv64,x-v=true,vext_spec=v1.0 ./bin/[platform]/[build_type]/ov_cpu_func_tests --gtest_filter=\"*smoke*Activation*Round*\"\n\n# If you use riscv-gnu-toolchain:\n<riscv_install_path>/bin/qemu-riscv64 -cpu rv64,v=true,vext_spec=v1.0 ./bin/[platform]/[build_type]/ov_cpu_func_tests --gtest_filter=\"*smoke*Activation*Round*\"\n```\n\n### Example Pull Requests\n\n* [Abs](https://docs.openvino.ai/2025/documentation/openvino-ir-format/operation-sets/operation-specs/arithmetic/abs-1.html) operation: https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/pull/30218\n\n\n### Resources\n\n- [Contribution guide - start here!](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n- [What is OpenVINO?](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino#what-is-openvino-toolkit)\n- [CPU plugin JIT emitters](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/emitters/README.md)\n- [Blog post on contributing to OpenVINO](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n- [User documentation](https://docs.openvino.ai/)\n- [Intel DevHub Discord channel](https://discord.gg/7pVRxUwdWG) - engage in discussions, ask questions and talk to OpenVINO developers\n- [How to link your Pull Request to an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#manually-linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-the-pull-request-sidebar)\n-  [\"Cross compile OpenVINO???

Tasks:\n\n* [ ] Identify and group existing navbar links into meaningful categories:\n  * Example: `Trackers`, `Community`, `Resources`, `Support`, etc.\n* [ ] Create dropdown components for each category.\n* [ ] Refactor the navbar JSX into smaller, reusable components.\n* [ ] Make sure dropdowns are fully responsive across screen sizes `(eg. hamburger menus)`.\n* [ ] Keep styling consistent with existing Tailwind setup.\n* [ ] Test keyboard accessibility and fallback for non-supported devices.\n\n---\n\n#### \uD83E\uDDE0 Suggestions:\n\n* Use component-based dropdowns (`Dropdown`, `DropdownItem`) to keep code modular.\n* For Tailwind users, consider `headlessui` or `@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu`.\n* Avoid too many nested dropdowns ??? keep UX simple and clean.\n* Keep a `navLinks.js` file to centralize routes if not already done.\n\n---\n\n#### \uD83D\uDEA6 Level 2: (7 Points)\n\n> While not algorithmically intense, this task requires clean architecture, UI design sense, and responsive layout handling. Ideal for contributors comfortable with component structure and layout refactoring.\n\n(see [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/AditiGupta-tech/neonest/blob/main/Contributing.md#-points--difficulty-levels))\n\n---\n\n**_??????

      "description" : "1.\t###  Enhancement: Make Essentials Page Fully Responsive\n\n#### \uD83D\uDCCC Description:\n\nThe **NeoNest Essentials section** includes elements like item logs, buttons, tabs, forms and an essential items dropdown. This issue aims to make the **entire `/Essentials` route** fully responsive so that users can easily view and interact with Essentials data, logs, and trackers on various screen sizes.\n\n#### ??? Tasks:\n\n* [ ] Refactor layout to adapt for various screen sizes.\n* [ ] Test and optimize layout on:\n\n  * [ ] Mobile devices (e.g., 360px width)\n  * [ ] Tablets (e.g., 768px)\n  * [ ] Desktops (e.g., 1440px+)\n* [ ] Ensure **Essentials log cards, buttons and icons** do not overflow or get clipped.\n* [ ] Verify **forms and inputs** work seamlessly on smaller viewports.\n* [ ] Improve spacing, font size, and element tap areas for better accessibility.\n* [ ] Ensure the items dropdown (see by clicking on `See essentials` button) is completely responsive without breaking its display on button click.\n\n> *Note:*\n> This issue is **specific to the `/Essentials` route**. \\\n\n#### \uD83E\uDDE0 Suggestions:\n\n* **Stack horizontal sections vertically** on mobile when needed.\n* Use Tailwind???s `flex-wrap`, `gap`, and breakpoint classes (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`) to allow fluid layouts.\n* Watch out for **absolute positioning** or **fixed heights** that might break on small screens.\n\n#### \uD83D\uDEA6 Level 1: (3 Points)\n\n> A frontend-focused task that boosts mobile UX. No backend edits needed, but requires a keen eye for layout polishing and responsive design best practices.\n\n(see [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/AditiGupta-tech/neonest/blob/main/Contributing.md#-points--difficulty-levels))\n\n---\n\n**_?????? Feel free to comment on this issue to get it assigned before starting your work. Unassigned PRs will not be counted for GSSoC and hence wont' be merged._**\n\n",

      "description" : "###  Enhancement: Make Sleep Page Fully Responsive\n\n#### \uD83D\uDCCC Description:\n\nThe **NeoNest Sleep section** includes elements like Sleep logs, buttons, tabs, charts, and forms. This issue aims to make the **entire `/Sleep` route** fully responsive so that users can easily view and interact with Sleep data, logs, and trackers on various screen sizes.\n\n#### ??? Tasks:\n\n* [ ] Refactor layout to adapt for various screen sizes.\n* [ ] Test and optimize layout on:\n\n  * [ ] Mobile devices (e.g., 360px width)\n  * [ ] Tablets (e.g., 768px)\n  * [ ] Desktops (e.g., 1440px+)\n* [ ] Ensure **Sleep log cards, buttons, charts, and icons** do not overflow or get clipped.\n* [ ] Verify **forms and inputs** work seamlessly on smaller viewports.\n* [ ] Improve spacing, font size, and element tap areas for better accessibility.\n\n> *Note:*\n> This issue is **specific to the `/Sleep` route**. \\\n\n#### \uD83E\uDDE0 Suggestions:\n\n* **Stack horizontal sections vertically** on mobile when needed.\n* Use Tailwind???s `flex-wrap`, `gap`, and breakpoint classes (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`) to allow fluid layouts.\n* Watch out for **absolute positioning** or **fixed heights** that might break on small screens.\n\n#### \uD83D\uDEA6 Level 1: (3 Points)\n\n> A frontend-focused task that boosts mobile UX. No backend edits needed, but requires a keen eye for layout polishing and responsive design best practices.\n\n(see [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/AditiGupta-tech/neonest/blob/main/Contributing.md#-points--difficulty-levels))\n\n---\n\n**_?????? Feel free to comment on this issue to get it assigned before starting your work. Unassigned PRs will not be counted for GSSoC and hence wont' be merged._**\n\n",

      "repositoryName" : "openvinotoolkit/openvino",
      "description" : "### Context\n\n[JIT Emitters](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/emitters/README.md) are part of code generation feature (a.k.a. tensor compiler) that automatically produces highly-efficient optimized fused subgraph binary code. Each emitter implements specific operation from low level OpenVINO dialect.\n\n### Prerequisites\nDue to limited resources, cross compilation is preferred option now for building OpenVINO targeting RISC-V development boards. Please see the documentation [\"Cross compile OpenVINO??? Runtime for RISCV64 systems\"](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/docs/dev/build_riscv64.md) for more details. For this work, you need to build [`xuantie-gnu-toolchain`](https://github.com/XUANTIE-RV/) or [`riscv-gnu-toolchain`](https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain.git) with `QEMU` support for emulation. So you don't need to have RISC-V development board even to contribute to OpenVINO for these platforms \uD83D\uDE03 \n\n### What needs to be done?\n\n* Create `fp32` [Tanh](https://docs.openvino.ai/2025/documentation/openvino-ir-format/operation-sets/operation-specs/arithmetic/tanh-1.html) operation [JIT Emitter](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/emitters/plugin/riscv64/jit_eltwise_emitters.hpp) for RISCV64 platform with RVV1.0 support.

At the moment, eg. when browsing a directory with httm -b mydir only snapshots of the directory itself are shown, \n\nTrue.\n\n> but not the snapshots when one of the files changed. \n\nAccording to POSIX, a directory's mtime and size changes when: \n\n1. A new file or subdirectory is created within it.\n2. An existing file or subdirectory is deleted from it.\n3. A file or subdirectory within it is renamed.\n\nNow, what it sounds like is you would like dedup behavior to include filesystem actions which do not change a directory's size or mtime, like: \n\n1. Modifying the contents of a file inside a directory\n2. Changes to files or directories in subdirectories.\n\nThis may be possible, but it would be time expensive.  Imagine doing this on your home directory, or on root.  You're asking `httm` to read all the metadata from all the directories and subs recursively.  \n\nPerhaps what you actually want is something simpler, like `--dedup-by=disable` and/or `--recursive`?  That will list all snapshots for said directory, and all files and subfolders within, and will allow you the recover from any of them?  Once you discover the latest file internal to the directory you wish to recover, you can navigate to the directory and date you wish to recover from.\n\n> I would like to have an option to see all unique snapshots of the directory and files therein, with the possibility to restore a snapshot of the whole directory.\n\nHave you used `--recursive` and `--restore`?\n\nPleased to discuss.  Perhaps if you could describe the usage pattern you think I may be missing?" ],

It finally needs a proper logo!\nThis is a follow-up to [Issue #215](https://github.com/bit-team/backintime/issues/215), where some ideas and early drafts were shared.\n\nWe???re looking for a designer who can help us create a strong application icon and possibly extending to tray icons and a banner image.\n\nWe know this is a big ask, so we want to be transparent about everything from the start.\n\n# \uD83C\uDFA8 What we're looking for\n- A main application icon. This is the first priority. Think of how it appears in the [About Dialog](https://translate.codeberg.org/media/screenshots/bit_aboutdlg_english.png).\n- The icon should also work as a tray icon in light and dark themes.\n  - Minimum supported size: 22??22 px\n- Bonus: a banner image (1500??500 px) for our [Mastodon presence](https://fosstodon.org/@backintime) would be lovely.\n- We would also like access to the source file (e.g. SVG), in addition to rendered formats (PNG, ICO, ...).\n- Creative freedom: We have a few ideas and sketches (see below), but we???re open to new, fresh concepts!\n- Inspiration and further resources:\n  - [Gnome Icon Guidelines](https://developer.gnome.org/hig/guidelines/app-icons.html)\n  - [AppIconPreview](https://flathub.org/apps/org.gnome.design.AppIconPreview) ??? useful tool for previewing icons\n  - [Blogpost: Designing a GNOME App Icon](https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/2019/12/30/designing-an-icon-for-your-app/)\n  - [SVG favicons + dark mode](https://css-tricks.com/svg-favicons-in-action/)\n  - Also consider this comment https://github.com/bit-team/backintime/issues/215#issuecomment-1646945614 .\n\n# ?????? Legal & Licensing\nWe know this is the boring part, but it???s important.\n\nIf you're familiar with licensing creative work, feel free to propose your own approach. If not, here???s what we suggest:\n- You remain the copyright holder.\n- The logo, including its source file, should be released under a license that???s compatible with GPL-2.0-or-later (the project???s license).\n- Preferred license: GPL-2.0-or-later, but we???re open to other free licenses that work well for artwork.\n- Important: We don???t own a trademark or plan to register one. That means it???s theoretically possible for others to re-use the logo under the license terms. But we???re not worried about that in practice.\n\nSome related discussions and resources:\n- [Open Source Design ??? Logo Licensing](https://discourse.opensourcedesign.net/t/how-to-licence-a-project-specific-software-logo)\n- [Debian Legal Discussion](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2024/08/msg00013.html)\n\nPlease don???t waste your resources and start creating the logo before we???ve agreed on licensing.\n\n# \uD83D\uDCA1 Sketches & Previous Ideas\nThese are just ideas. You???re free to ignore or remix them.\n\n## \uD83D\uDD18 Discs\n- A stack of 3 discs, representing storage space and backups.\n- An arrow wrapped around to symbolize backup or time.\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/acd97349-5d4f-4c51-b638-9f0862f3022e)\n\n## \uD83D\uDCC1 Hardlink Visualization\n- Three backup levels (discs), with vertical \"file\" columns.\n- Visualizes how files change across backups:\n  - Cuts = modified files\n  - Solid blocks = unchanged\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c0a7b6e-5a5a-4db1-850f-904710a72a73)\n\n## \uD83D\uDD24 \"BIT\" Abbreviation\n- Using the acronym B-I-T, with an arrow motif.\n- Concern: might be confused with Bitcoin.\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6085190-980f-4bdb-84f6-9c37aab0fa9f)\n\n## \uD83D\uDD04 The Arrow\n- An arrow circling the logo, symbolizing time or backup.\n- Can go counter-clockwise to emphasize the \"back\" in Back In Time.\n- Starts thin and gets thicker: suggests motion and time travel.\n\n## \uD83D\uDD17 Related Threads\n- [Issue #215: Old Logo Discussion](https://github.com/bit-team/backintime/issues/215)\n- [Forum post on Inkscape.org](https://inkscape.org/forums/cafe/open-source-project-back-in-time-looking-for-an-artist-creating-a-logo/)\n\n# \uD83E\uDD1D What We Offer\nWe can???t pay you, but:\n- You will be clearly credited in the project (e.g. README, website).\n- Your work will be seen and used by thousands of users.\n- You???ll help improve the visual identity of a long-standing FOSS project.\n\n# \uD83E\uDDF5 Want to contribute?\nComment here. If you have questions or suggestions, especially around licensing, let???s talk!\n\n# ?????? Feedback welcome!\nWe want this process to be transparent and respectful. If you???re a designer reading this and think we could improve how we???re approaching this: please tell us. We're open to honest feedback.",
