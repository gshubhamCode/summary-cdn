      "description" : "### \uD83D\uDE80 The feature, motivation and pitch\n\n\uD83C\uDF89 **#18343 introduces dynamic Expert Parallelism Load Balancing (EPLB)** for DeepSeek-V2/V3/R1 models.\n\nAs MoE (Mixture-of-Experts) models become more common, we???d love help extending EPLB support to other MoE models???such as Qwen3, Llama 4, and more.\n\nThis is a great **first good issue** for anyone interested in model internals or systems work. #18343 was built with generality in mind, so extending it to other models or quantization methods should be relatively straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### ??? How to add support for a new model\n\nImplement the `MixtureOfExperts` protocol. Specifically, you???ll need to:\n\n- Expose relevant MoE configuration flags.\n- Provide access to expert weights for EPLB to rearrange.\n- Forward EPLB-related arguments into the `FusedMoE` layer.\n\n\uD83D\uDCCC **Note on weight loading:**  \nFor models with **redundant experts**, you???ll need to carefully adjust the weight loading logic. `FusedMoE` returns an `expert_params_mapping` that reflects expert duplication, but you may need to modify the model class to ensure correct loading behavior.\n\n\uD83D\uDD0E Example: See how it???s done in [`deepseek_v2.py`](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/18343/files#diff-420f1cd67991a63cb419ca0e00e6f42cbe825864d0541e0662eeed2f9ddbd021).\n\n---\n\n### ??? How to add support for quantized models\n\nThis is usually even easier???just make sure EPLB-related arguments are properly forwarded in your quantization path.\n\n\uD83D\uDD0E Example: See [`fp8.py`](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/18343/files#diff-5511bfcc9c53f7d96517ad43e4087f6777bef21302da983f42cafae40a866644) for a minimal working change.\n\n---\n\n\uD83D\uDC4B **Want to contribute?**\n\nWe???d love your help in extending EPLB support! Feel free to comment below or open a draft PR???we???re happy to guide you through the process.\n\n### Alternatives\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Before submitting a new issue...\n\n- [x] Make sure you already searched for relevant issues, and asked the chatbot living at the bottom right corner of the [documentation page](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/), which can answer lots of frequently asked questions.",

And sorry for the delayed response, I was on a flight.\n\nSince @aladerran  was the first to reply, I???ll go ahead and assign you to the EPLB support for Qwen-3 ??? thanks for picking it up!\n\nFor others who are interested: I did a quick search for models using the `FusedMoE` class under `vllm.model_executor.models`, and found the following files:\n\n- `aria.py`\n- `dbrx.py`\n- `dots1.py`\n- `ernie45_moe.py`\n- `granitemoe.py`\n- `grok1.py`\n- `hunyuan_v1_moe.py`\n- `jamba.py`\n- `kimi_vl.py`\n- `llama4.py`\n- `minimax_text_01.py`\n- `mistral.py`\n- `olmoe.py`\n- `phimoe.py`\n- `qwen2_moe.py`\n- `qwen3_moe.py`\n\nHowever, note that EPLB mainly benefits multi-node setups, and especially models that **weren???t** trained with expert load-balancing loss (like DeepSeek-V3, though this kind of models are not many nowadays). So we may not need to support every model above.\n\nThat said, Qwen-3, Llama 4, and MiniMax-01 are probably the highest priority given their size and practical relevance ??? but support for other MoE models is also very welcome!\n\nThere???s also the `DeepSeekMTP` model, which is a bit special. It's used for speculative decoding and follows a different code path. I haven't yet checked whether it uses the same expert parallel config as the main model, but if it does, EPLB might be applicable there too. Contributions in that direction would be appreciated as well.\n\nLet me know if anyone wants to take a specific model ??? happy to help guide where needed!", "Hi @abmfy , I would like to take Llama4. Thanks!", "@abmfy , i would like to contribute on mistral.py", "Hey @abmfy , I would like to take MiniMax-01. Thank you!", "Hi @abmfy, I'd like to contribute on Grok-1. Thank you!" ],

When I pull up a video, the extension will check to see if the description, tags (or perhaps even the transcript) has any words that match with the whitelist.

      "comments" : [ "# :wave: Important: PLEASE READ :wave:\n\nThis issue has been labeled as a **good first issue** and is available for anyone to work on.\n\nIf this is your first time contributing to an open source project, some aspects of the development process may seem unusual, arcane, or some combination of both.\n\n1.  **You cannot \"claim\" issues.** People new to open source often want to \"claim\" or be assigned an issue before beginning work. The typical rationale is that people want to avoid wasted work in the event that someone else ends up working the issue. However, this practice is not effective in open source, as it often leads to \"issue squatting\", in which an individual asks to be assigned, is granted their request, and then never ends up working on the issue. Accordingly, you are encouraged to communicate your intent to address this issue, ideally by providing a rough outline as to how you plan to address the issue or asking clarifying questions, but, at the end of the day, we will take running code and rough consensus in order to move forward quickly.\n2.  **We have a very high bar for contributions.** We have very high standards for contributions and expect all contributions???whether new features, tests, or documentation???to be rigorous, thorough, and complete. Once a pull request is merged into stdlib, that contribution immediately becomes the collective responsibility of all maintainers of stdlib. When we merge code into stdlib, we are saying that we, the maintainers, commit to reviewing subsequent changes and making bugfixes to the code. Hence, in order to ensure future maintainability, this naturally leads to a higher standard of contribution.\n\nBefore working on this issue and opening a pull request, please read the project's [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md). These guidelines and the associated [development guide](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/docs/contributing/development.md) provide important information, including links to stdlib's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), license policy, and steps for setting up your local development environment.\n\nTo reiterate, we **strongly** encourage you to refer to our contributing guides **before** beginning work on this issue. Failure to follow our guidelines significantly decreases the likelihood that you'll successfully contribute to stdlib and may result in automatic closure of a pull request without review.\n\nSetting up your local development environment is a critical first step, as doing so ensures that automated development processes for linting, license verification, and unit testing can run prior to authoring commits and pushing changes. If you would prefer to avoid manual setup, we provide pre-configured [development containers](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/tree/develop/.devcontainer) for use locally or in GitHub Codespaces.\n\nWe place a high value on consistency throughout the stdlib codebase. We encourage you to closely examine other packages in stdlib and attempt to emulate the practices and conventions found therein.\n\n-   If you are attempting to contribute a new package, sometimes the best approach is to simply copy the contents of an existing package and then modify the minimum amount necessary to implement the feature (e.g., changing descriptions, parameter names, and implementation).\n-   If you are contributing tests, find a package implementing a similar feature and emulate the tests of that package.\n-   If you are updating documentation, examine several similar packages and emulate the content, style, and prose of those packages.\n\nIn short, the more effort you put in to ensure that your contribution looks and feels like stdlib???including variables names, bracket spacing, line breaks, etc???the more likely that your contribution will be reviewed and ultimately accepted. We encourage you to closely study the codebase **before** beginning work on this issue.\n\n:sparkles: Thank you again for your interest in stdlib, and we look forward to reviewing your future contributions. :sparkles:\n" ],

      "comments" : [ "# :wave: Important: PLEASE READ :wave:\n\nThis issue has been labeled as a **good first issue** and is available for anyone to work on.\n\nIf this is your first time contributing to an open source project, some aspects of the development process may seem unusual, arcane, or some combination of both.\n\n1.  **You cannot \"claim\" issues.** People new to open source often want to \"claim\" or be assigned an issue before beginning work. The typical rationale is that people want to avoid wasted work in the event that someone else ends up working the issue. However, this practice is not effective in open source, as it often leads to \"issue squatting\", in which an individual asks to be assigned, is granted their request, and then never ends up working on the issue. Accordingly, you are encouraged to communicate your intent to address this issue, ideally by providing a rough outline as to how you plan to address the issue or asking clarifying questions, but, at the end of the day, we will take running code and rough consensus in order to move forward quickly.\n2.  **We have a very high bar for contributions.** We have very high standards for contributions and expect all contributions???whether new features, tests, or documentation???to be rigorous, thorough, and complete. Once a pull request is merged into stdlib, that contribution immediately becomes the collective responsibility of all maintainers of stdlib. When we merge code into stdlib, we are saying that we, the maintainers, commit to reviewing subsequent changes and making bugfixes to the code. Hence, in order to ensure future maintainability, this naturally leads to a higher standard of contribution.\n\nBefore working on this issue and opening a pull request, please read the project's [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md). These guidelines and the associated [development guide](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/docs/contributing/development.md) provide important information, including links to stdlib's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), license policy, and steps for setting up your local development environment.\n\nTo reiterate, we **strongly** encourage you to refer to our contributing guides **before** beginning work on this issue. Failure to follow our guidelines significantly decreases the likelihood that you'll successfully contribute to stdlib and may result in automatic closure of a pull request without review.\n\nSetting up your local development environment is a critical first step, as doing so ensures that automated development processes for linting, license verification, and unit testing can run prior to authoring commits and pushing changes. If you would prefer to avoid manual setup, we provide pre-configured [development containers](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/tree/develop/.devcontainer) for use locally or in GitHub Codespaces.\n\nWe place a high value on consistency throughout the stdlib codebase. We encourage you to closely examine other packages in stdlib and attempt to emulate the practices and conventions found therein.\n\n-   If you are attempting to contribute a new package, sometimes the best approach is to simply copy the contents of an existing package and then modify the minimum amount necessary to implement the feature (e.g., changing descriptions, parameter names, and implementation).\n-   If you are contributing tests, find a package implementing a similar feature and emulate the tests of that package.\n-   If you are updating documentation, examine several similar packages and emulate the content, style, and prose of those packages.\n\nIn short, the more effort you put in to ensure that your contribution looks and feels like stdlib???including variables names, bracket spacing, line breaks, etc???the more likely that your contribution will be reviewed and ultimately accepted. We encourage you to closely study the codebase **before** beginning work on this issue.\n\n:sparkles: Thank you again for your interest in stdlib, and we look forward to reviewing your future contributions. :sparkles:\n" ],

Happy to test further!\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9912c367-ebdc-451b-8b05-d0c50c54e7c2", "I had this in my Kestra configuration that I didn't realise:\n```yaml\n          environment:\n            name: dev\n```\n\nThis does beg the question whether the UI option should be removed if it's set in the configuration. I am not a typical user as I have 15+ Docker Compose configs with Kestra so easily gloss over minor differences but does make the UI option fairly redundant and confusing like I found myself in.", "Thanks for the clarification ??? that makes sense now.\n\nI also tested this by setting environment.name in my docker compose file.\n\n```yaml\nenvironment:\n  name: dev\n```\nIn this Setup:\n\n- I wasn???t able to fully remove the environment name from the UI ??? it would fall back to the configured value.\n\n- But I was able to change it in the UI, and the new value persisted ??? effectively overriding the config.\n\nSo the behavior does seem correct in the sense that the config acts as a default, and the UI allows you to override it if needed. That flexibility probably makes sense for certain setups.\n\nThat said, I do think it could be a bit confusing at first. Instead of removing the field, maybe we could add a \"reset to default\" option or a small tooltip/note to indicate that the value is coming from the config." ],

      "description" : "This has happened for a long time, but I should really file an issue, so here it is. It seems to probably happen more commonly in Chrome, and it seems to be harder to reproduce in Firefox (I wasn't able to reproduce it in FF in my testing right now, @0HyperCube mentions in the comments below that he has encountered it in FF). See `NumberInput.svelte`.\n\nWhen you click and drag a number input field of the increment (not range) style, meaning the kind you can drag infinitely left or right, it will sometimes teleport the value to a wildly different value from the one it started with. This can be reproduced by drawing a rectangle and dragging left and right on its stroke weight parameter in the Properties panel repeatedly in quick, small left and right drags until occasionally it will make a big jump.\n\nI hypothesize this is caused by weirdness in the event ordering and mouse position reporting with the [pointer lock](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_Lock_API) API, and it might be related to the widget being broken in Safari: #2038. I recommend logging the values that are being reported by the API and current state every frame to narrow down when the events occur and produce the discrepancy.\n\nAt the the 4-second mark in this video, we see it jump from `131.3` to `17.3` immediately when the click-and-drag begins:\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61b1b1e6-4560-4555-aac5-f7b54cbfacb9",

The end to end time difference is +60ms (140 - 80). It's really noticeable because I have a feeling something else is causing even more of a delay that's not picked up in these tests. It feels like 200-300ms before the prompt is ready.\n\nAny thoughts on how to troubleshoot what's causing this slowdown?\n\n",

      "description" : "We are in the process of moving this repository to Read the Docs, and to do that we need to convert our pages from Markdown to RST. This issue is to transfer the Contribute to Mautic section: [https://contribute.mautic.org/contributing-to-mautic](https://contribute.mautic.org/contributing-to-mautic). You can also update and improve the content on these pages if you like - do check with the relevant team leads to ensure it's up to date and relevant.\n\n## Sections to migrate \nAs this is a large section I recommend that we take it one section at a time. Drop a message in the comments to be assigned to a section.\n\n- [x] Designer\n- [x] Developer\n- [x] Marketer\n- [x] Tester\n- [x] Translator\n- [x] Writing for Mautic\n- [x] Event organiser\n- [ ] Web developer\n- [x] Server administrator\n- [x] Contributing financially\n- [x] Google Summer of Code @Iqmaa \n\nYou can do this in the current repo, as we've got a folder set up, `/docs`, which will be used for Read The Docs.\n\nYou can build this documentation locally by cloning this repository, and following these steps: https://github.com/mautic/user-documentation/tree/5.x?tab=readme-ov-file#build-documentation-locally. Change into the /docs folder and then (assuming you have DDEV and Docker/Colima installed) type `ddev config` and select `build/html `as the root folder when configuring DDEV. Then when complete, type `ddev start` and it'll give you the link to your local testing environment.\n\nIf you need to make a link file to add an external URL, please use the command line tool 'make link'. This will generate a reference macro and a link file for you.\n\nFor internal linking check the docs on using the [:ref: role](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/cross-referencing-with-sphinx.html#the-ref-role) for linking within the same document, and using [:doc: to link across pages](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/cross-referencing-with-sphinx.html#the-doc-role).\n\n**Please note: if you see folders called .revs these are old version control files from Grav. Ignore them! (they should be deleted) and instead work on the actual files.**\n\nWhen you've converted the file/s, **they need to live within the /docs folder**. We can create a structure using sub-folders to organise the sections. You also need to add the pages to the Table of Contents in the index.rst file for them to show on the menu. Docs on the ToC can be found [here](https://sublime-and-sphinx-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/indices.html).\n\nWe highly recommend that you use VS Code with Vale installed. Let us know if you have any problems.\n\nSome useful resources: \n- https://sublime-and-sphinx-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest guide to Sphinx/RST formatting\n- https://sublime-and-sphinx-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/references.html#use-the-external-links-extension how to do external links - always check the /docs/links directory first! You can use the terminal command '`make link`' to create the link file automagically.\n\nThere are many MD to RST tools out there which can help speed up the process, however you will still need to review your output to ensure it passes our Vale grammar rules. Headings must always be unique, as well.\n\nWe use the following for headings:\n\n```\nH1 ###\nH2 ***\nH3 ===\nH4 ---\nH5 ~~~\n```\n\nPlease ask in #t-education on Slack if you get stuck with anything!\n\n",

      "comments" : [ "@maeste\nI'm curious why communication is restricted to only HTTP(S). \nWhen the system becomes large, shouldn't the EDA architecture be the first choice? \nI have looked at many projects, and there hasn't been any attempt in this regard.", "@Denovo1998, there are many reasons to use HTTP(S) + SSE in this case. Very briefly, a few points are\n* A2A aims to be truly distributed across multiple locations over the internet. HTTP is the best protocol to avoid any problems with firewalls and NAT. Using proprietary protocols, especially binary ones, on non-standard ports introduces various challenges in this area \nHTTP is a well-known standard that is well-supported in all languages. A2A aims to be polyglot or even language-agnostic.\n* EDA is great for many reasons, but it also has some negatives. The main one for A2A is it needs to rely on a message broker. A2A instead aims to be fully peer-to-peer protocol with discovery capabilities (like Kubernetes is for pods). IOW HTTP/SSE is more distributed in terms of control, but more tightly coupled in logic. EDA brokers are more centralized in transport, but more decoupled in system design.\n\nDoes it mean that an EDA architecture with similar concepts of agents and agent cards does not make sense? Not at all, I think it could make sense and can be an extension to apply on top of A2A-core to be used in a specific case based on local network communication (no firewall) and it may have some advantages. But it cannot be part of the SDK because it's out of the scope of the standard defined by the spec.\nSo, from here, my proposal: decouple the transport to make it easy to plug different transports to A2A-core. The SDK will use only HTTP/SSE and maybe gRPC in the future, but anyone can build his own local network A2A system over Pulsar, Kafka, MQTT etc. It may also be valuable to have a gateway between different protocols to expose an agent or a set of agents implemented in EDA as standard HTTP agents.\n\nDOes it make sense and does it answer your question?" ],

The end goal of this would be to save compute by allowing users to pause and resume streams at will.\n\nBy using a `tokio::sync::watch::channel` with a bool type, we can control the flow of a stream. See below for a (ChatGPT-generated) example of this in action:\n\n```rust\nstruct PauseableStream {\n    paused_rx: watch::Receiver<bool>,\n    counter: usize,\n}\n\nimpl Stream for PauseableStream {\n    type Item = usize;\n\n    fn poll_next(mut self: Pin<&mut Self>, cx: &mut Context<'_>) -> Poll<Option<Self::Item>> {\n        if *self.paused_rx.borrow() {\n            // Register the task to be notified when the paused value changes.\n            let _ = self.paused_rx.changed();\n            cx.waker().wake_by_ref(); // try polling again later\n            Poll::Pending\n        } else {\n            let val = self.counter;\n            self.counter += 1;\n            Poll::Ready(Some(val))\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Motivation\n<!--\nPlease describe the use case(s) or other motivation for the new feature.\n-->\nBetter overall control over streamed responses",

However, this is wrong. The radius of the border _should_ be larger because that radius is being applied to a larger rectangle. Hence, we will need a larger radius there to make up for it. The solution won't be much code, but it is a bit of thinking to get the maths right. This is a good issue for anyone who likes geometry and signed distance fields :)",

      "description" : "### Feature Description\n\nAs a user, I want the shortcut for moving events to the sidebar be consistent with the shortcuts for moving events between the sidebar, so that I don't have to memorize more shortcuts.\n\nIn other words, the shortcut to move a timed event (grid or all-day) to the sidebar should be `CTRL + [META] + [LEFT/RIGHT ARROW]. \n\n----\n\nWe currently have this working for the `[META] + SHIFT + ,` shortcut. Practically, in this issue we just need to change the shortcut to be `[META] + SHIFT + [LEFT ARROW]`.\n\n<img width=\"836\" height=\"794\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3aedd1f-a6df-4b06-bfc3-b5cac21c3f07\" />\n\n\n### Use Case\n\nWe're already using the `CTRL + [META]` prefix to move someday events\n- `CTRL + [META] + [RIGHT]` when a This Week event is open moves the event to the next week\n- `CTRL + [META] + [DOWN]` when a This Week event is open moves the event to the This Month section\n\nKeeping this same pattern for regular events feels intuitive. Users will hopefully internalize the idea that whenever they want to change an event's location, they just need to type `CTRL + [META]` and then play arrow with the arrows. \n\n### Additional Context\n\nIn the future, we're planning to experiment with allowing the users to reschedule events entirely with the keyboard. For example, they'd go from a sidebar event to the grid and then to the correct time without ever touching the mouse. Having a consistent shortcut experience is important for that workflow to work, so doing this now will pay dividends later.",

Attempt OAuth2 authentication between network functions\n4. Observe `crypto/rsa: verification error` in logs\n\nSample files that were used for creating the openbao, issuer and certs can be found in:\n\n[certificate-generation-files.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21008291/certificate-generation-files.zip)\n\n## Expected behavior\nOAuth2 authentication should work with certificates generated by standard PKI engines like OpenBao/Vault, similar to how it works with the pre-generated certificates.\n\n## Environment (please complete the following information):\n - free5GC Version: v4.0.1\n - OS: Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS\n - Kernel version: 5.15.0-142-generic\n - go version: I am using the free5gc provide container images, they don't have the go binary installed\n\n## Trace File\n### Configuration File\n\nSample NRF config:\n```\ninfo:\n  version: 1.0.2\n  description: NRF initial local configuration\n\nconfiguration:\n  MongoDBName: free5gc #

I don't think this is best practice, cert path should be flexible\n- NRF will always generate new nrf.pem and nrf.key.

This limitation requires users to shorten their pipeline names to successfully schedule their pipelines on Vertex AI, which can be restrictive and inconvenient.\r\n\r\n## Task Description\r\nInvestigate and address the issue with the Vertex scheduler's character limit for pipeline names in ZenML. The goal is to either increase the character limit or implement a mechanism that automatically handles longer names without user intervention.\r\n\r\n## Expected Outcome\r\nUsers should be able to schedule pipelines on Vertex AI without the constraint of a 64-character limit on pipeline names.\r\nZenML should provide a seamless experience, either by accommodating longer names or by intelligently managing them within the existing Vertex scheduler limitations.\r\nThis fix will enhance user convenience and flexibility in naming pipelines.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Implement\r\n- Reproduce the issue to understand the exact limitations and behavior of the Vertex scheduler with respect to pipeline names.\r\n- Explore solutions such as increasing the character limit or automatically abbreviating/transforming long pipeline names while preserving their uniqueness and recognizability.\r\n- Implement the chosen solution in a way that is transparent and intuitive for the user.\r\n- Test the implementation with various pipeline name lengths to ensure compatibility and functionality.\r\n- Update documentation to inform users about the handling of pipeline names in Vertex scheduler and any best practices or limitations.\r\n\r\n## Additional Context\r\nThis issue is crucial for users who require descriptive and potentially lengthy names for their pipelines, especially in complex or large-scale MLOps environments.\r\n\r\n## Code of Conduct\r\n- [ ] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct",

But thinking about it more this makes less and less sense.\r\n\r\n* Needs to have a unique name to not collide with other stuff\r\n* What if the consumer already uses a db? This would add another dependency.\r\n* Needs to also accept project name\r\n* Might need to create the directory but so may the rest of the application and perhaps it will want to set some permissions or detect first-run situation.\r\n* Generally feels out-of scope", "I think two things are being conflated\r\n\r\n1. the topic of this issue data persistence / configuration folder for `payjoin-cli`. This could go in a .payjoin folder at the default app location. Right now the config file is called from wherever the binary is invoked. An alternative could be to pass config path via cli.\r\n2. A receiver saving inputs that have been seen. Right now this is done KISS by serializing a `HashSet` to a file called `inputs_seen.json` again, wherever the binary is invoked. Uri already uses `serde`, and I don't see that dependency as additional or going anywhere anytime soon.\r\n\r\nHaving a proper DB would definitely be better, but I don't want to overoptimize before user demand. In the worst case we could migrate the HashSet to a more robust / performant DB later. This issue is separate to the one of keeping data organized in a payjoin-cli specific data folder", "Ah, this is about cli, not library, it makes sense then. Originally CLI was intended as PoC but it could be nice to develop it further. In that case I totally agree it should be stored in a DB. I have experience with `rusqlite` which works fine but has a bit annoying MSRV.", "This was closed by https://github.com/payjoin/rust-payjoin/pull/281/files which added a proper DB and the option to set a custom DB path as an option.", "My concern with this issue is when people `cargo install payjoin-cli` the behavior changes depending on which directory they call the program in. Using a default directory and only using an alternative with a manual configuration argument would fix this problem", "working on this  ,  is this still something we need ?", "This is definitely on the periphery of our essential path. It's non-essential (cause what we have does already work) but nice to have. The point is so that `cargo install payjoin-cli` can have a standard location for config & persisted data which you might want if you uninstalled/re-installed or to make documentation easier to read.\n\nI have not thought through all of the trade-offs nor through a user experience that would enable multiple configs on the same machine. Right now I often use one config in the top level payjoin and another in the payjoin-cli subdirectory to test payjoin-cli end to end.\n\n\nFor these reasons I suggest you take it on only if you're confident you can make good decisions about trade offs and come up with a comprehensive solution somewhat independently, and if you find it essential to your personal goals." ],

      "description" : "## Summary\n\nImplement a comprehensive onboarding wizard that guides new BirdNET-Go users through initial setup, educates them about AI limitations, and provides an interactive tour of the web interface. This will significantly improve the first-time user experience and reduce configuration errors.\n\n**\uD83D\uDCDD Note: This feature proposal is open for comments and feedback from the community. Please share your thoughts on the design, suggest improvements, or indicate which aspects would be most valuable to you.**\n\n## Background\n\nNew users currently need to manually configure BirdNET-Go through YAML files or the web interface without guided assistance. This can be overwhelming and may lead to suboptimal configurations or missed features. An onboarding wizard would:\n\n- Guide users through essential configuration steps\n- Educate about AI model limitations and appropriate use cases\n- Showcase key features through an interactive tour\n- Provide option to import existing BirdNET-Pi data\n- Ensure users understand privacy implications and data sharing options\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n### 1. Welcome Screen\n\nOn first launch, display a modal dialog with:\n\n```\nWelcome to BirdNET-Go!\n\nBirdNET-Go is powered by the BirdNET Analyzer AI model developed by\nthe BirdNET Team at Cornell Lab of Ornithology and Chemnitz University\nof Technology. Learn more at github.com/birdnet-team/BirdNET-Analyzer\n\nReady to set up your bird monitoring station?\n\n[Get Started] [Import from BirdNET-Pi]\n```\n\n### 2. Setup Wizard (6 Steps)\n\n#### Step 1: Location Configuration\n- Interactive map widget for setting latitude/longitude\n- Auto-detect location option (with permission)\n- Display: \"Your location helps filter species to those likely in your area\"\n- Show preview of common species for the selected location\n\n#### Step 2: Audio Source\n- Radio buttons for audio source selection:\n  - \uD83C\uDFA4 Microphone/Soundcard (default)\n  - \uD83D\uDCF9 RTSP Stream\n  - \uD83D\uDD0A Multiple Sources\n- Audio level meter showing real-time input\n- \"Test Audio\" button with visual feedback\n- Troubleshooting link if no audio detected\n\n#### Step 3: Language & Display\n- Dropdown with 40+ language options for species names\n- Time format toggle (12/24 hour)\n- Timezone selection (auto-detect with override option)\n- Preview of species name in selected language\n\n#### Step 4: Detection Settings\n- Preset selection with descriptions:\n  ```\n  ?????? Balanced (Recommended)\n  Good balance of accuracy and sensitivity\n  ??? Confidence threshold: 0.8\n  ??? Sensitivity: 1.0\n  \n  \uD83C\uDFAF High Accuracy\n  Fewer false positives, may miss some birds\n  ??? Confidence threshold: 0.9\n  ??? Deep Detection enabled\n  \n  \uD83D\uDCE1 High Sensitivity  \n  Detects more birds, more false positives\n  ??? Confidence threshold: 0.6\n  ??? Sensitivity: 1.25\n  ```\n- \"Show Advanced Settings\" expandable section\n\n#### Step 5: Privacy & Integration\n- Privacy options:\n  - [ ] Enable privacy filter (removes detections when human voices detected)\n  - [ ] Enable dog bark filter (reduces false owl/crow detections)\n- Data sharing:\n  - [ ] Share detections with BirdWeather community\n  - [ ] Enable anonymous telemetry to help improve BirdNET-Go\n- Audio retention:\n  - Export audio clips: [Yes/No]\n  - Retention policy: [7 days / 30 days / Forever]\n\n### 3. Interactive Web UI Tour\n\nUsing a JavaScript tour library (e.g., Shepherd.js), create guided tour with these stops:\n\n1. **Dashboard Overview**\n   ```\n   Spotlight: Main dashboard area\n   \"This is your command center. Recent detections appear here\n   in real-time. The summary shows your most detected species.\"\n   ```\n\n2. **Detection Details**\n   ```\n   Spotlight: Detection row\n   \"Click any detection to see the spectrogram, listen to audio,\n   and verify or correct the identification.\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Live Audio Stream**\n   ```\n   Spotlight: Audio level indicator\n   \"Click here to listen to your live audio feed and check\n   microphone placement.\"\n   ```\n\n4. **Settings Access**\n   ```\n   Spotlight: Settings menu\n   \"Fine-tune detection parameters, manage species lists,\n   and configure integrations here.\"\n   ```\n\n5. **Species Management**\n   ```\n   Spotlight: Species settings\n   \"Add species to always include or exclude, and set\n   custom thresholds for specific birds.\"\n   ```\n\n### 4. BirdNET-Pi Import\n\nIf user selects import option:\n\n```\nImport from BirdNET-Pi\n\n1. Upload your BirdNET-Pi database:\n   [Choose File] (Accepts: birds.db, *.sqlite)\n\n2. Import options:\n   [???] Historical detections\n   [???] Species include/exclude lists\n   [???] Custom species settings\n   [ ] Audio recordings (if available)\n\n3. Date range:\n   From: [Date picker] To: [Date picker]\n\n[Import] [Skip]\n\nProgress: [??????????????????????????????] 80% - Importing detections...\n```\n\n### 5. Completion Screen\n\n```\n??? Setup Complete!\n\nBirdNET-Go is now monitoring for bird sounds.\n\nQuick tips:\n??? First detections may take 15-30 seconds to appear\n??? Check Settings ??? Range Filter to see species expected in your area\n??? Enable notifications for rare bird alerts\n??? Join our community forum for tips and support\n\n[View Dashboard] [Documentation] [Run Tour Again]\n```\n\n### 6. Responsible Use Guidelines (Final Step)\n\nAfter setup completion, display this important information:\n\n```\n\uD83E\uDD9C Using BirdNET-Go Responsibly\n\nBirdNET-Go is a powerful tool that enhances your birding experience through\nAI-assisted identification. To ensure the best outcomes for both birding \nand conservation:\n\n??? Review and verify detections before sharing observations\n??? Use the confidence scores as a guide, not absolute truth\n??? Cross-reference with field guides and local expertise\n??? Consider seasonal patterns and habitat suitability\n\nWhen contributing to citizen science:\n??? Only submit observations you've personally verified\n??? Include notes about visual or behavioral confirmation\n??? Use AI detections as a starting point for your own observations\n\nThis approach ensures data quality for scientific research while maximizing\nyour learning and enjoyment of birds!\n\n[???] I understand\n\n[Start Monitoring]\n```\n\n## Implementation Tasks\n\n- [ ] Create wizard component structure in web UI\n- [ ] Implement state management for wizard progress\n- [ ] Add API endpoint: `GET /api/v2/wizard/status`\n- [ ] Add API endpoint: `POST /api/v2/wizard/complete`\n- [ ] Create location picker component with map\n- [ ] Implement audio source selector with level meter\n- [ ] Build preset configuration templates\n- [ ] Integrate JavaScript tour library\n- [ ] Create tour content and styling\n- [ ] Implement BirdNET-Pi import functionality\n- [ ] Add database migrations for import\n- [ ] Create user preference storage for wizard completion\n- [ ] Add \"Reset Wizard\" option in settings\n- [ ] Implement skip/back navigation\n- [ ] Add help tooltips and contextual information\n- [ ] Create responsive mobile layout\n- [ ] Write user documentation\n- [ ] Add integration tests\n\n## UI/UX Considerations\n\n- Use consistent styling with existing BirdNET-Go interface\n- Ensure accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)\n- Provide clear progress indication (step 1 of 6)\n- Allow users to go back and modify previous choices\n- Save progress in case of interruption\n- Offer \"Quick Setup\" vs \"Custom Setup\" paths\n- Include contextual help and tooltips\n- Support for mobile and tablet layouts\n\n## Technical Requirements\n\n- Frontend: Leverage existing Alpine.js/HTMX stack\n- Use Tailwind CSS for consistent styling  \n- Store wizard completion state in user preferences\n- Graceful fallback if JavaScript disabled\n- Compatible with all authentication methods\n- Internationalization support for wizard text\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n- Reduction in support requests about initial configuration\n- Increased percentage of users enabling integrations\n- Faster time from installation to first detection\n- Higher user retention in first week\n- Positive feedback on user experience\n\n## Future Enhancements\n\n- Video tutorials embedded in wizard steps\n- Automatic hardware optimization based on system detection\n- Community-contributed location-specific tips\n- Integration with hardware setup (USB audio devices)\n- Suggested microphone placement based on environment\n\n## References\n\n- Current installation documentation: `/doc/wiki/installation.md`\n- Configuration guide: `/doc/wiki/guide.md`\n- Similar implementations: \n  - Home Assistant onboarding\n  - Nextcloud first-run wizard\n  - Gitlab initial setup\n\n## Request for Feedback\n\nThis is a proposal for improving the new user experience in BirdNET-Go.

      "repositoryName" : "tphakala/birdnet-go",
      "description" : "# Feature: eBird Export for Verified Detections\n\n## Summary\n\nImplement an eBird-compatible CSV export feature that allows users to export their verified bird detections from BirdNET-Go in a format suitable for direct upload to eBird.org. This will enable citizen scientists to contribute their acoustic monitoring data to eBird's global bird observation database.\n\n## Background\n\nBirdNET-Go users accumulate valuable bird detection data that could contribute to citizen science efforts through eBird. Currently, there's no easy way to export this data in eBird's required format. Users must manually transcribe their detections, which is time-consuming and error-prone.\n\neBird is the world's largest biodiversity-related citizen science project, and enabling easy data export would:\n- Allow BirdNET-Go users to contribute to global bird monitoring efforts\n- Provide validation of acoustic detections through eBird's review process\n- Enable users to maintain their eBird life lists with acoustic observations\n- Support scientific research by making acoustic monitoring data more accessible\n\n## Requirements\n\n### eBird CSV Format Requirements (from eBird documentation)\n\n**File specifications:**\n- CSV format with comma delimiters\n- Maximum file size: 1 MB\n- No quotation marks in data\n- No hard returns/line breaks\n\n**Required columns:**\n1. **Date** - MM/DD/YYYY format\n2. **Country** - 2-character ISO code\n3. **State/Province** - 1-3 character code\n4. **Location Name** - Text description\n5. **Protocol** - e.g., \"Stationary\", \"Traveling\"\n6. **Start Time** - Military or 12-hour format\n7. **Duration** - In minutes\n8. **All observations reported** - Y/N\n9. **Species Name** - Common or Scientific (must match eBird taxonomy)\n10. **Species Count** - Number, X (presence), + (continuing count), or * (uncounted)\n\n**Additional requirements:**\n- Single location per checklist\n- Single calendar date per checklist\n- Species names must match current eBird taxonomy\n- Optional latitude/longitude in decimal degrees\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n### 1. API Endpoint\n\nCreate a new API v2 endpoint for data export:\n\n```\nGET /api/v2/export/ebird\n```\n\n**Query parameters:**\n- `date_start` - Start date (YYYY-MM-DD)\n- `date_end` - End date (YYYY-MM-DD)  \n- `verified_only` - Boolean, export only user-verified detections (default: true)\n- `format` - Export format, initially \"ebird\" (extensible for future formats)\n\n**Response:**\n- Content-Type: text/csv\n- Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"birdnet-go-ebird-export-YYYY-MM-DD.csv\"\n\n### 2. Data Processing\n\n**Grouping Strategy:**\n- Group verified detections by date to create daily \"checklists\"\n- Use earliest detection time as checklist start time\n- Calculate duration from first to last detection of the day\n- Default to \"Stationary\" protocol with user-configurable override\n\n**Data Mapping:**\n- Map BirdNET common names to eBird taxonomy\n- Handle special cases (e.g., \"Rock Pigeon\" ??? \"Rock Pigeon (Feral Pigeon)\")\n- Use \"X\" for species count (presence-only data)\n- Set \"All observations reported\" to \"N\" (acoustic monitoring may miss species)\n\n### 3. Configuration\n\nAdd export settings to config.yaml:\n\n```yaml\nexport:\n  ebird:\n    country_code: \"US\"        # Default country code\n    state_code: \"CA\"          # Default state/province code  \n    location_name: \"My Yard\"  # Default location name\n    protocol: \"Stationary\"    # Default protocol\n    default_duration: 60      # Default duration if only one detection\n```\n\n### 4. User Interface\n\n**Export Page** (`/export`):\n- Date range picker with presets (Today, This Week, This Month, Custom)\n- Checkbox: \"Export verified detections only\" (checked by default)\n- Export format dropdown (initially just \"eBird CSV\")\n- Preview table showing what will be exported\n- Download button\n- Help text explaining eBird requirements\n\n**Access:**\n- Add \"Export Data\" menu item under Tools section in sidebar\n- Require authentication to access export features\n\n### 5. Implementation Details\n\n#### File Structure:\n```\ninternal/\n  api/v2/\n    export.go         # API endpoint handlers\n  export/\n    ebird.go          # eBird format conversion logic\n    ebird_test.go     # Unit tests\n  datastore/\n    export_queries.go # Database queries for export\n```\n\n#### Key Functions:\n\n```go\n// API Handler\nfunc (c *Controller) ExportEBird(ctx echo.Context) error\n\n// Export Logic  \nfunc GenerateEBirdCSV(detections []datastore.Note, settings ExportSettings) ([]byte, error)\n\n// Data Access\nfunc (ds *DataStore) GetVerifiedDetectionsForExport(startDate, endDate string) ([]Note, error)\n```\n\n## Technical Considerations\n\n### Performance\n- Implement pagination for large date ranges\n- Add caching for species name mappings\n- Stream CSV generation for memory efficiency\n\n### Data Quality\n- Only export user-verified detections by default\n- Validate species names against eBird taxonomy\n- Handle timezone conversions correctly\n\n### Security\n- Require authentication for export endpoint\n- Validate date ranges to prevent excessive exports\n- Implement rate limiting (e.g., 10 exports per hour)\n- Sanitize location names and other text fields\n\n### Error Handling\n- Clear error messages for invalid date ranges\n- Warn if no verified detections found\n- Handle eBird taxonomy mismatches gracefully\n\n## Future Enhancements\n\n1. **Direct eBird API Upload**\n   - Integrate with eBird API for direct checklist submission\n   - Store eBird API tokens securely\n   - Show upload status and eBird checklist links\n\n2. **Additional Export Formats**\n   - Generic CSV with all detection data\n   - JSON export for programmatic use\n   - KML for mapping applications\n\n3. **Advanced Features**\n   - Scheduled automatic exports\n   - Email export results\n   - Batch operations for multiple date ranges\n   - Custom checklist grouping (by hour, location, etc.)\n\n4. **Species Mapping Management**\n   - Admin interface for taxonomy mapping\n   - Automatic taxonomy updates from eBird\n   - Handle subspecies and regional variations\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n- Number of users utilizing export feature\n- Volume of detections exported to eBird\n- User feedback on ease of use\n- Successful eBird upload rate\n- Reduction in manual data entry time\n\n## Testing Plan\n\n1. **Unit Tests**\n   - CSV format generation\n   - Date/time formatting\n   - Species name mapping\n   - Edge cases (empty data, single detection, etc.)\n\n2. **Integration Tests**\n   - API endpoint with various parameters\n   - Database query performance\n   - Authentication and authorization\n\n3. **Manual Testing**\n   - Export and upload to eBird sandbox\n   - Verify all required fields present\n   - Test with various date ranges and data volumes\n\n## Documentation\n\n- User guide for export feature\n- eBird upload walkthrough\n- Troubleshooting common issues\n- API documentation for developers\n\n## References\n\n- [eBird Upload Spreadsheet Data](https://support.ebird.org/en/support/solutions/articles/48000907878-upload-spreadsheet-data-to-ebird)\n- [eBird API Documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/664302/S1ENwy59)\n- Current BirdNET-Go CSV export: `internal/observation/observation.go`\n\n## Request for Feedback\n\nThis feature would bridge BirdNET-Go with the global eBird community. Please share your thoughts:\n\n- Would you use this feature to contribute to eBird?\n- What additional export formats would be valuable?\n- Any concerns about data quality or privacy?\n- Suggestions for the user interface?\n\nYour input will help shape this feature to best serve the BirdNET-Go community!",

Problem\n\nJabRef currently supports three auto-linking strategies to associate files with entries:\n\n* **Starts with citation key**\n* **Exact match with citation key**\n* **Custom regular expression**\n\n<img width=\"1118\" height=\"757\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5cdeaee-74e4-4dd4-b9da-3d0aed093ba6\" />\n\n\n\nHowever, these strategies fall short when the file name does **not** include the citation key. Many users name files based on the **title**, making it impossible to auto-link them with the current strategies.\n\n### ??? Goal\n\nImplement a new **title-based fuzzy matching** strategy for auto-linking files to entries. This will improve usability for users who name their files using (parts of) the publication title.\n\n---\n\n### \uD83E\uDDE9 Tasks\n\n1. **Create a new `TitleBasedFileFinder` class**\n\n   * Package: `org.jabref.logic.util.io`\n   * Use the title field of the BibEntry for matching\n\n2. **Implement a robust matching strategy**\n\n   * Convert LaTeX title to Unicode: `LatexToUnicodeAdapter#format`\n   * Clean invalid characters: `FileNameCleaner#cleanFileName`\n   * Match using:\n\n     * **Substring**\n     * Optional: **Jaro-Winkler similarity** with a threshold (e.g., 0.05)\n\n3. **Write unit tests**\n\n   * Focus on edge cases, Unicode, cleaned filenames, and fuzzy similarity\n\n4. **Integrate into preferences**\n\n   * Update `AutoLinkPreferences`\n   * Modify `FileFinders#constructFromConfiguration`\n   * Extend the Preferences UI to support selecting this new strategy\n\n---\n\n### \uD83E\uDDEA Why This Is a Good First Issue\n\n* Introduces you to **test-driven development**\n* Touches core parts of JabRef: logic layer, UI, and preferences\n* Requires critical thinking ??? not solvable by AI, but rewarding to implement\n* You???ll learn about string similarity, file I/O, and JabRef???s data model\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDCDA Related Work\n\n* Feature request: #9267\n* Prior art: PR #9316\n\n---\n\nInterested?

But we should also encourage best practices when it comes to a11y and include an `aria-label` field for these that describes the purpose of the button to end users. This can come in the form of a `aria-label` and `title` attributes:\n\n### What to Change\n\nBefore:\n\n```html\n<button type=\"button\" class=\"btn-icon preset-filled\"><IconArrowRight size={18} /></button>\n```\n\nAfter:\n\n```html\n<button type=\"button\" class=\"btn-icon preset-filled\" title=\"Go\" aria-label=\"Go\">\n    <IconArrowRight size={18} />\n</button>\n```\n\nAdditionally we should scan all portions of our applications (docs + theme generator) for instances of `btn-icon` and append these attributes accordingly, so we're practicing what we preach.\n\n---\n\n> NOTE: there *may* be icon buttons used within components, in that case we'll need to add new props to said components to allow for proper i18n translations. These should be documented in a new/standalone issue as a separate follow up task. This will be out of scope of this ticket.",

Via luxtronik write command or custom automation? I have no entities, that set this mode directly.", "@Gifford47 i have an entity named \"number.luxtronik2_dhw_target_temperature\" which basically is what it says it is: domestic water temperature. Combined with an automation checking the solar production and few other checks like current energy price, i increase the temp from default 45 to 60 and turn back when the temp is reached. The default desinfection target temp is actually 65, but with that entity i cannot set above 60, don't know why. But 60 is hot enough.

Usually by more than 50%.\n\nMay I ask how you disable or enable the hot water circulation pump? I think the \"ID_Einst_BWZIP_akt\" is not in the current implementation from BenPru. But I can add it via Bouni and YAML. right? ", "@Mehli12 \nYeah, looks like I managed it with the integration by Bouni.\nI monitor it's state with a sensor added in the configuration file:\n```\nsensor:\n  - platform: luxtronik\n    sensors:\n      - group: parameters\n        id: ID_Einst_BWZIP_akt\n        friendly_name: Circulation Pump\n```\n\nAn change it's value with the `luxtronik.write` action:\n```\naction: luxtronik.write\ndata:\n  parameter: ID_Einst_BWZIP_akt\n  value: 1\n```\n\nHowever, the post I made actually inspired me to find a more reliable way to disable the circulation pump. I realized it could work more seamlessly with the heat pump if I used the integration to modify the circulation **schedule** instead of just turning it off directly.\n\nWith a bit of help from Gemini, I figured out the parameters used for the matrix that stores circulation start and end times (in seconds from midnight). The IDs follow this pattern:\n\n**ID_Einst_SuZIP + Wo/25/Tg + _zeit_X_Y**\n\n- The first part indicates it???s a schedule for the circulation pump.  \n- The second part defines the type of schedule:  \n  - `Wo` ??? same for every day  \n  - `25` ??? different for weekends  \n  - `Tg` ??? different for each day (just like in the heat pump settings)  \n- The last part defines the coordinates in the matrix:  \n  - `X` is the row (values 0???4)  \n  - `Y` is the column:  \n    - `0` = start time, `1` = end time for day 1  \n    - `2` = start time, `3` = end time for day 2, and so on  \n\nFor example, `ID_Einst_SuZIP25_zeit_0_2` refers to the **start time for the weekend schedule on day 2**.\n\nSo, instead of completely disabling the circulation pump, I now modify the schedule based on presence. When everyone leaves, the schedule changes from the normal 6:00???00:00 to just **on at 6:00 and off at 6:15**. I use the same `luxtronik.write` action as before. This method has proven to be much more reliable for keeping the pump off when it???s not needed.\n\nAdditionally, if no one is home at 5:58, I change the schedule to end at **5:55**, and start at **5:50**, wait 18 minutes, then switch it back to the usual 6:00???6:15. I update the **end time first**. The system handles this well???even if the end time is earlier than the start time. For instance, if the start time is 6:00 and the end time is 5:00, the pump runs from 6:00 **until 5:00 the next day** and **doesn't run** from 5:00 to 6:00.\n\nSo I've been using that **instead of** `ID_Einst_BWZIP_akt` for the past few days and I think it's going to stay that way.\n", "@BenPru is it possible to impliment this Switch into your Addon", "When adding the entity, please provide a bit of documentation on how the parameter should be used. Some of these parameters are not very intuitive, can cause unexpected behavior or reduce the efficiency when not properly used. We really need to capture the information in this topic so it can be found again." ],

Write a brief description of how you will approach the task (without using ChatGPT).\n3. Add your Telegram handler in your application (e.g., in OnlyDust or similar)\n4. Write ETA in your application\n\n\n\n## What should I do if I have a problem\n1. Try to google it before asking. Googling is taking major part of dev work \n2. If you couldn't find answer your question with Google, text your question to [dev](https://t.me/spotnet_dev/4) group with your question.\n3. Do not send DM to maintainer, it would be better and faster to ask other contributors in chat \n\n\n## How to prepare PR\n1. Check if your code [smell](https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/smells) good\n2. Add `close #<issue number>` to link your issue with your PR\n3. Do not commit changes that are unrelated to your task\n4. Check after you created PR, if you committed everything\n\n\n## Task Description\n1. In the [filters folder](./blob/main/margin/margin_app/app/telegram/filters), create a new admin filter that checks the user ID against `ADMIN_IDS` from the settings. If it matches, return `True`.\n2. Create a new handler in [this folder](./blob/main/margin/margin_app/app/telegram/handlers), for example `/admin_check`, that replies with a message like `You are an admin!` or `You aren???t an admin!`, or a similar message conveying the same meaning.\n",

Write a brief description of how you will approach the task (without using ChatGPT).\n3. Add your Telegram handler in your application (e.g., in OnlyDust or similar)\n4. Write ETA in your application\n\n\n\n## What should I do if I have a problem\n1. Try to google it before asking. Googling is taking major part of dev work \n2. If you couldn't find answer your question with Google, text your question to [dev](https://t.me/spotnet_dev/4) group with your question.\n3. Do not send DM to maintainer, it would be better and faster to ask other contributors in chat \n\n\n## How to prepare PR\n1. Check if your code [smell](https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/smells) good\n2. Add `close #<issue number>` to link your issue with your PR\n3. Do not commit changes that are unrelated to your task\n4. Check after you created PR, if you committed everything\n\n\n## Task Description\n1. In the [handlers folder](./blob/main/margin/margin_app/app/telegram/handlers), create a new file named `admin.py`. Inside, add a handler called `/assets`. Use the [`Admin Filter` from this issue](https://github.com/djeck1432/spotnet/issues/915) to verify the user is an admin. Then, call the [`Assets statistic` method from this issue](https://github.com/djeck1432/spotnet/issues/906) to retrieve the data. Format the response using Telegram Markdown so it displays neatly.\n2. Provide a screenshot demonstrating that the handler works as expected.\n",

I need some guidance to get started.", "Hello @singh1203, \uD83D\uDC4B \nThank you for taking ownership of this task.\n\nTo enable LWS support within the KAI Scheduler, you will be implementing a new PodGrouper plugin. This component is responsible for abstracting various workload types into PodGroups prior to scheduling.\n\nThe initial implementation steps are as follows:\n1. Develop a new PodGrouper plugin that inspects the LWS instance and generates PodGroupMetadata:\n    a. minAvailable should likely be derived from the leaderWorkerTemplate.\n    b. The podGroup owner should probably be the leader pod.\n    c. Set the default priority class to inference.\n    For reference, you may review the AzureML plugin implementation: [AzureML Plugin Example](https://github.com/NVIDIA/KAI-Scheduler/blob/bac4866ab5bba39cc76e900ced0c1da31339a4a1/pkg/podgrouper/podgrouper/plugins/aml/aml_grouper.go)\n\n2. Register the new plugin within the PodGrouper hub: [PodGrouper Hub Registration](https://github.com/NVIDIA/KAI-Scheduler/blob/bac4866ab5bba39cc76e900ced0c1da31339a4a1/pkg/podgrouper/podgrouper/hub/hub.go#L88)\n\n3. Generate the necessary RBAC resources by executing make manifests. This will update the kai-podgrouper ClusterRole to include the appropriate permissions for LWS.\n\nAdditional documentation on extending the PodGrouper functionality is available here:\n[PodGrouper Plugin Development Guide](https://github.com/NVIDIA/KAI-Scheduler/blob/main/docs/developer/pod-grouper.md)\n\nPlease let me know if any clarification is needed.", "Hi @singh1203 ,\n\nThat's great!

The LWS integration is nearly complete from my end - the core functionality is implemented and working. The only current blocker is that the test suite for leaderworkersets is being skipped, even when using the --test-third-party-integrations flag.\nI've verified that the CRD is properly defined and the test code includes the appropriate skip condition check (crd.SkipIfCrdIsNotInstalled), but I'm having trouble identifying why the tests aren't executing. Meeting the July 15th target is definitely feasible once we resolve this testing issue.\nWould you be able to help identify what might be causing the test suite to skip? Any guidance on the test environment setup or CRD prerequisites would be greatly appreciated to get this across the finish line." ],

      "comments" : [ "I would argue that the previous beahviour worked by chance but it was a bug. Scikit-learn transformers API expect to return an array of shape `(n_samples, n_features)`. Having a single dimension is really ambiguous because we cannot guess if it is a single sample or a single feature. For instance, if you use `set_output(transform=\"default\")`, then you will get an array of shape `(20,)` where I would argue that the `FeatureUnion` failed.\n\nSo here, I think that the fact that we raise an error is actually fine. The error message is a bit tricky thought. The fact it does not raise with `set_output(transform=\"default\")` is actually annoying I think.\n\nSo one way would be to validate the output of `FunctionTransformer` being sure it should be 2-D. However, we sometime want this transformer to be lenient so I wonder if the behaviour should be driven by a parameter, similarly to the `validate` parameter but for the output.", "@jeremiedbb @ogrisel do you have any thoughts regarding if `FunctionTransformer` should be permissive regarding the shape of the output or if we should strictly follow the API of other transformers.\n\nI'm thinking that we usually want this transformer to be permissive on the input side.", "Note that the mentioned code already raises 2 informative warnings before raising the final exception:\n\n```python\n/Users/ogrisel/code/scikit-learn/sklearn/preprocessing/_function_transformer.py:311: UserWarning: When `set_output` is configured to be 'pandas', `func` should return a pandas DataFrame to follow the `set_output` API  or `feature_names_out` should be defined.\n  warnings.warn(warn_msg.format(\"pandas\"))\n/Users/ogrisel/code/scikit-learn/sklearn/preprocessing/_function_transformer.py:311: UserWarning: When `set_output` is configured to be 'pandas', `func` should return a pandas DataFrame to follow the `set_output` API  or `feature_names_out` should be defined.\n  warnings.warn(warn_msg.format(\"pandas\"))\n```\n\nThe function transformer should not return a pandas series but a pandas dataframe.\n\nMaybe we could change this to accept series and automatically wrap them as dataframes because there is no ambiguity in this particular case.\n\nIf not, I agree that we should at least improve the error message.\n\nLet me try to simplify the reproducer to make it minimal.", "Here is a minimal reproducer:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import FunctionTransformer\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import FeatureUnion\n\n\ndata = pd.DataFrame(dict(a=range(3), b=range(3)))\nFeatureUnion(\n    [\n        (\"a\", FunctionTransformer(lambda df: df[\"a\"])),\n        (\"b\", FunctionTransformer(lambda df: df[\"b\"])),  # exception not raised if you remove this line.\n    ]\n).set_output(transform=\"pandas\").fit_transform(data)\n```\n\nNote that the `FeatureUnion` requires 2 series, otherwise there are no exceptions, only the warnings.", "Actually, here is the real bug in my opinion: if you remove the `.set_output(\"pandas\")` from the above snippet, the code works without failing or raising warnings but outputs meaningless results:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import FunctionTransformer\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import FeatureUnion\n\n\ndata = pd.DataFrame(dict(a=range(3), b=range(3)))\nFeatureUnion(\n    [\n        (\"a\", FunctionTransformer(lambda df: df[\"a\"])),\n        (\"b\", FunctionTransformer(lambda df: df[\"b\"])),\n    ]\n).fit_transform(data)\n```\n```\narray([0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2])\n```\n\nInstead, `FeatureUnion` should raise an explicit error message to make it explicit that some transformers output 1d data-structures instead of the expected 2d.", "I think the `FeatureUnion._hstack` method should be changed to raise an informative error message if some elements in `Xs` are not 2D data-structures. We should also check that their `.shape[0]` match the expected number of samples measured on the `X` parameter passed to `FeatureUnion.transform` or `FeatureUnion.fit_transform`.\n\nEDIT: the error message of the exception should mention the name of the transformer that generated invalid output shapes along with the observed shape and the expected number of data points.", "hello i am Ahsan , i am new to open source , i would like to contribute .", "/take", "Hi @Nafeessidd1 , I noticed you've claimed this issue recently.

Often, these lists will be short (<5 arguments), but there is no guarantee that the JVM will unroll their loops automatically.\n\nFunctions that perform relatively simple operations may benefit from manually unrolled variants that skip loop and conditional checks, and instead have a straight bytecode path for the calculations.\n\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\n\nReview var-args functions, particularly those with numeric arguments and basic calculations. If they are a candidate for loop unrolling, implement and benchmark to prove it is faster.\n\nExamples of var-args functions:\n\n- greatest/least\n- IN\n- CASE\n- coalesce\n- ~l2price~\n- concat\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Full Name:\n\nNick Woolmer\n\n### Affiliation:\n\nQuestDB\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

Some pages in the Launchpad manual have broken internal links because they have been recently migrated from another site and are yet to be correctly linked to each other. Launchpad's docs are now hosted on Read the Docs and are written in restructured text or markdown. When linking these docs, it is recommended that the [:ref: method](https://canonical-starter-pack.readthedocs-hosted.com/latest/reference/style-guide/#internal-references) described in the style guide be used. Using :ref: instead of a file path makes it less likely that the link will break if a file is renamed or moved to a different folder.\n\nTask\n-------\nThe page linked below has one or more broken internal links. Direct the links to the correct pages within the docs using the :ref: method mentioned above. You may need to add a target to a file you're linking to if one is not already present.\n\n[your-launchpad-account](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/launchpad/en/latest/user/explanation/your-launchpad-account/)",

You can use the code in IGraph/M as reference, but this should be written in C with igraph's own data structures instead of C++:\n\nhttps://github.com/szhorvat/IGraphM/blob/8de23ab6b2dcab448ba13bffe4c3a864c54927e7/IGraphM/LibraryResources/Source/IG.h#L656-L673\n\nYou can write a helper function to transform a PageRank result to LinkRank, then implement a LinkRank analogue of each of the three existing PageRank functions in igraph.\n\n@ntamas Do we want to target this directly on `develop` and reorder the parameters to match the standard in https://github.com/igraph/igraph/wiki/Guidelines-for-function-argument-ordering ?

Instructions for getting started are here: https://github.com/igraph/igraph/wiki/Quickstart-for-new-contributors", "I prefer this to be done one a separate branch that can be merged into `develop` when it's done.

This means we need to add support for using either an OUT or an IN mode.\n\nThese two changes can be made in a single PR that should be targeted on the `develop` branch (not `master`).\n\nOne this is done, we are ready for LinkRank.\n\nLet me know if you would like to get started with this work.", "Sure, I will have a look and work.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nRavikiran Bhonagiri\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Thu, Feb 6, 2025 at 3:21???PM Szabolcs Horv??t ***@***.***>\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n> @Ravikiran-Bhonagiri <https://github.com/Ravikiran-Bhonagiri> Would you\r\n> be able to do some groundwork first and clean up the PageRank function\r\n> interfaces?\r\n>\r\n> First, the parameters of PageRank function should be reordered like this:\r\n>\r\n> igraph_error_t igraph_personalized_pagerank(\r\n>     const igraph_t *graph,\r\n>     const igraph_vector_t *weights,\r\n>     const igraph_vector_t *reset,\r\n>     igraph_vector_t *vector,\r\n>     igraph_real_t *value,\r\n>     const igraph_vs_t vids,\r\n>     igraph_real_t damping,\r\n>     igraph_bool_t directed,\r\n>     igraph_pagerank_algo_t algo,\r\n>     igraph_arpack_options_t *options)\r\n>\r\n> igraph_personalized_pagerank_vs() and igraph_pagerank() should follow the\r\n> same order.\r\n>\r\n> All calls to the functions (library, tests, benchmarks), as well as the\r\n> documentation should also be updated.\r\n>\r\n> Second, the igraph_bool_t directed parameter should be replaced by an igraph_neimode_t\r\n> mode parameter.\r\n>\r\n> These two changes can be made in a single PR that should be targeted on\r\n> the develop branch (not master).\r\n>\r\n> One this is done, we are ready for LinkRank.\r\n>\r\n> Let me know if you would like to get started with this work.\r\n>\r\n> ???\r\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\r\n> <https://github.com/igraph/igraph/issues/2598#issuecomment-2641072687>,\r\n> or unsubscribe\r\n> <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AEFYEUTDNQE2IF2UOS2CYAD2OPG5TAVCNFSM6AAAAABWRZD7Y2VHI2DSMVQWIX3LMV43OSLTON2WKQ3PNVWWK3TUHMZDMNBRGA3TENRYG4>\r\n> .\r\n> You are receiving this because you were mentioned.Message ID:\r\n> ***@***.***>\r\n>\r\n", "@Ravikiran-Bhonagiri Let me know if you are still planning on working on this, or whether this is free to take by others.", "This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity.

It's not possible to ask our users to install a legacy version of ffmpeg, especially since it will require users to build from the source.\n\nTo fix this, we have to decide to use the latest LTS version, 7.1, which is in active maintenance mode.\n\nI believe API changes will be between the current version, 6.0.0, and the new version (7.1.1). So, the current implementation of the wasmedge-ffmpeg plugin will also need to be modified.\n\n\n### Details\n\nThe following action items should be finished:\n\n- [ ] Update to the new ffmpeg version 7.1.1\n- [ ] Modify the implementation of wasmedge-ffmpeg\n- [ ] Ensure the CI passes for building and testing\n\n### Appendix\n\n_No response_",

      "comments" : [ "Confirmed. This appears to be the same issue as in #6899. The stratify transformer's code naively reverses the circuit by reversing moments, but does not reverse the operations within moments, which does matter because multiple interactions with the same measurement key are allowed in a single moment, and they will be sequenced in the order that they're added to the moment. https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/a89f5b9f0875dcae419efc13790af078075fcb6b/cirq-core/cirq/transformers/stratify.py#L83-L90.\n\n#6899 fixed this for the `align_right` transformer, reversing the operations within each moment when it reversed the circuit. So the same fix should be applied here. It's probably worth creating a `Circuit.reverse()` method to avoid copy-paste, and to reduce the likelihood of this happening in the future.\n\nThe example attached to the issue produces a huge circuit after transforming. Here's a much simpler one. \n\n```python\n    q0, q1 = cirq.LineQubit.range(2)\n    circuit =  cirq.Circuit([\n        cirq.measure(q0, key='c'),\n        cirq.X(q1).with_classical_controls(\"c\"),\n        cirq.X(q0).with_classical_controls(\"c\"),\n        cirq.X(q1),\n    )\n    print(repr(circuit))\n    circuit = stratified_circuit(circuit)\n    print(repr(circuit))\n\n    simulator = cirq.Simulator()\n    simulator.run(circuit)\n```\n\nNote this bug has nothing to do with subcircuits.\n" ],

      "description" : "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\nWhen I initially opened Mbin on mobile (fedia) I knew my first stop was to subscribe to a bunch of communities so my feed comes to life with interesting stuff.\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/023f234c-20ac-4df1-a191-c308af1b3aae\n\n1. Clicking on search I was hoping that I would see at the top of the results a name match result for the \"Montreal\" community\n2. I realized that the term \"Magazine\" means community after clicking on it and looking at the list\n3. Went to search and typed in the name of a city to try to find that the community I know I've seen on Lemmy but the community didn't open.\n4. Searched for a string to open the community, realized there must be some over way to search for the community at this point but figured this would work\n5. The community opens and then I went on a hunt for a subscribe button, finding it in the menu on the side\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nThere are a few ways to handle this, seems like anything helps\n- [ ] (1) An exact string match for a community (less the domain) seems like it could show a \"Community Results\" box that show \"Communities matching your result\". It would contain one or two results and have a \"view more\" link at the bottom if people are in serious onboarding mode and looking to add a lot of related communities \"montreal_food\" and \"montreal_housing\" etc.\n- [ ] (2) The term Magazine has become confusing, especially now that we are federated and viewing /c/ urls for Communities in Lemmy and PieFed. It's easy to get overwhelmed/confused with fediverse software and that step of \"Oh, this is a community... I think... maybe it's a superset, maybe it's a subset, OK note to self this is probably a community\" I'm not seeing the benefit, I can definitely see and have experienced the barrier.\n- [ ] (3) The autocomplete for this is excellent, but I was hoping if a community was selected and the text field above left blank that the \"Community Result\" search box would show up with the community to \"go to the community\"\n- [ ] (4) Maybe allowing a blank search term just shows the latest posts for the community, or goes to the community if it has been selected?\n- [ ] (5) I would suggest a very compact community header that has the name, logo/background image and a subscribe/unsubscribe button and a button to \"expand\" it to show everything. It's hard to know that you are actually on a community and I really only found that I could subscribe by chance. Under the hamburger menu I just don't expect to find elements related to inline content. That's where I expect to find search tools, DMs, profile settings perhaps.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nDetailed above.\n\n** Additional Context **\nI'm a brand new user to Mbin who users Lemmy, Reddit and Piefed so I though I would just note the pain points I hit before I learn the software and stop seeing them. Hope this is helpful and not too annoying.",

Being on mobile the magazine search is not that easy to find, as the header links are hidden in the menu (what you called \"hamburger menu\"), but on desktop you'll see this: \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6dd3f84a-59c8-4031-bf71-0b20648279e0)\n\nThe box that you filled in is an additional filter for the search term, not intended to work on its own. But maybe it should be.\n\nThe magazine panel is only hidden in the menu on mobil, on desktop it looks something like this: \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8b92cc7-28ac-44cb-84ad-70fec82ed8b9)\n\nAnd the indicator that you are in a magazine gets hidden on mobile...\n\nSo things to fix this issue in my opinion:\n- [ ] Add an indicator on mobile that you are inside of a magazine. Preferably use the one already in the header and do not hide it on mobile\n- [ ] Add magazines to the results of the \"normal\" search", "The search enhancements are taken care of by #1670, the indicator gets added in #1671" ],

I disabled Windows search indexing on my Nextcloud directory because windows kept on downloading files I wanted to only keep online every time I searched for something in the parent folder.\n\nThe search function in the Nextcloud tray menu is able to find the desired sub folder, but clicking the folder only opens the containing folder and not the folder itself. This is useless to me because, as said, there are a lot of different folders and the folder names are too similar.\n\nIt looks like Nextcloud just opens the containing folder for folders or files. It would be nice if there was at least a context open to allow opening folder or files.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nOpen folder or file by default and have open containing folder the context menu option, but that risks messing with other people's workflow since open containing folder is the current behavior.",

A thin, easy-to-use PHP client for sending ILP messages would be a wonderful addition to the QuestDB ecosystem.\n\nWe really like your idea of porting the existing Java client's API. It provides a nice, fluent, builder-style interface that's intuitive and helps prevent errors. Maintaining that API would be the perfect goal.\nFor anyone in the community interested in picking this up (or for our own reference!), here's a high-level plan on how we could structure it, closely mirroring the Java version.\nProposed Structure\n\nWe could create an AbstractLineSender to handle the buffer logic and line assembly, with concrete LineTcpSender and LineUdpSender classes for the network transport.\n\nAPI Mapping (Java -> PHP)\nThe fluent API could be mapped almost 1-to-1:\ntable(string name) -> public function table(string $name): self\nsymbol(string name, string value) -> public function symbol(string $name, string $value): self\nlongColumn(string name, long value) -> public function longColumn(string $name, int $value): self\ndoubleColumn(string name, double value) -> public function doubleColumn(string $name, float $value): self\nstringColumn(string name, string value) -> public function stringColumn(string $name, string $value): self\nboolColumn(string name, bool value) -> public function boolColumn(string $name, bool $value): self\nat(long timestamp) -> public function at(int $timestamp): void\nflush() -> public function flush(): void\nclose() -> public function close(): void (Could also be handled in __destruct)" ],

      "description" : "Hi, I'm looking to perhaps migrate from glob to fdir and one big blocker for me is that glob allows you to inject a custom \"fs\" implementation like so:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// in-memory filesystem module, which works in the browser\r\nimport memfs from 'memfs';\r\n\r\nglob('**/*.json', { fs: memfs });\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be cool if the node builtin modules could be optionally substituted, e.g. `path-unified` is an NPM package which is just a `node:path` clone that works in the browser out of the box, and `memfs` would be a good `node:fs` replacement.\r\n\r\nThe path replacement is basically always a good idea because that module has no reason not to work in a browser env, the fs module is slightly harder because browser doesn't have filesystem access by default, you either need to use an in-memory replacement or an adapter which makes it interact with the browser's filesystem access API (bit more complicated). memfs allows doing both, fortunately.\r\n\r\nYou can use package entrypoints for example to internally do this in your package:\r\n```js\r\nimport fs from 'fdir/fs';\r\n```\r\nusing:\r\n```json5\r\n{\r\n  \"exports\": {\r\n    \"./fs\": {\r\n      \"node\": \"./lib/fs-node.js\", // re-exports \"node:fs\"\r\n      \"default\": \"./lib/fs-browser.js\", // re-exports an empty variable \"export let fs;\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nso when not in a Node env, this lib would require the user to pass \"fs\" as an option to any fdir calls, similar to how you do it in glob, since there isn't a default fallback. You could also set a default fallback -> `memfs` instead of \"empty variable\", up to you.\r\n\r\nIf you're at all interested in this approach to make this lib work in browser out of the box without any bundler shenanigans, I'd be happy to investigate this and open a PR",

It clearly states that EOS and image deprecation date for tis image is May 2025. \n\nI suspect the error can be easily fixed by updating [this line](https://github.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-apps/blob/55d09c01704909e1142fd14e2a91d5525872efd0/server_manager/www/gcp_account.ts#L275), but I'm not sure what image is to be used (otherwise I could try to open a PR). \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. open Outline Manager\n2. connect to GCP account\n3. create a project using \"ADD SERVER\" tab\n4. create server using on of the locations (same behaviour is observed for multiple server locations)\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\nSuccessfully completed addition of new server as it was before.\n\n### What actually happened?\n\nI've tried to create a new GCP server using the respective option in \"ADD SERVER\" tab. \n\n### Outline Version\n\n1.17.2\n\n### What operation system are you using?\n\nmacOS\n\n### Operating System Version\n\nSonoma 14.6.1\n\n### Screenshots and Videos\n\n_No response_",

      "description" : "### \uD83D\uDD0D Motivation\n\nCitation count provides a useful indicator of the academic impact of a publication. Automating the population of this field from Semantic Scholar saves manual effort and enhances bibliographic data quality in JabRef.\n\n### \uD83D\uDCCC Goal\n\nExtend the existing `SemanticScholarCitationFetcher` to retrieve the **citation count** for a given paper using the Semantic Scholar API and store it in a new BibTeX field `citationcount`.\n\n### \uD83D\uDEE0??? Tasks\n\n1. **Integrate citation count fetching**\n\n   * Implement logic in `org.jabref.logic.importer.fetcher.citation.semanticscholar.SemanticScholarCitationFetcher` using\n     `PaperDetails#getCitationCount()` from\n     `org.jabref.logic.importer.fetcher.citation.semanticscholar.PaperDetails`.\n\n2. **Add a new field**\n\n   * Define a new field `citationcount` in `org.jabref.model.entry.field.StandardField` (under JabRef-specific fields).\n   * Ensure that the field is recognized and included in citation fetcher updates.\n\n3. **Write tests**\n\n   * Add unit tests in\n     `org.jabref.logic.importer.fetcher.citation.semanticscholar.SemanticScholarCitationFetcherTest`\n     to verify that citation count is fetched and set correctly.\n   * Additonally, Mock or simulate Semantic Scholar API responses with citation counts.\n\n4. **UI integration**\n\n    * Add a new FieldEditor `CitationCount` (inspired by IdentifierEditor) and integrate it into the UI by modifying FieldEditors#getForField(...).\n    * Add an update button, which uses the SemanticScholarFEtcher to update the citation cound.\n\n### ??? Acceptance Criteria\n\n* When the fetcher is run on an entry with a DOI or title, and Semantic Scholar returns a citation count, the value is written to the `citationcount` field.\n* The value is stored as an integer.\n* Field appears in the entry editor in tab \"General\"\n\n\n### \uD83D\uDCDA Helpful resources\n\n* [[Semantic Scholar API](https://api.semanticscholar.org/)](https://api.semanticscholar.org/)\n* [`[PaperDetails](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/src/main/java/org/jabref/logic/importer/fetcher/citation/semanticscholar/PaperDetails.java)`](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/src/main/java/org/jabref/logic/importer/fetcher/citation/semanticscholar/PaperDetails.java)\n* [`[SemanticScholarCitationFetcher](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/src/main/java/org/jabref/logic/importer/fetcher/citation/semanticscholar/SemanticScholarCitationFetcher.java)`](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/src/main/java/org/jabref/logic/importer/fetcher/citation/semanticscholar/SemanticScholarCitationFetcher.java)\n* [[How to contribute to JabRef](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n* [[Developer Docs](https://devdocs.jabref.org/)](https://devdocs.jabref.org/)\n\n",

      "description" : "### Overview\nThe current Long descriptions for certain karmor CLI commands (e.g., karmor vm policy) include manually written sections for subcommands and global flags. These are already auto-generated by Cobra, leading to redundancy in the help output and potential discrepancies in the future.\n\nThese changes were merged recently in this [commit](https://github.com/kubearmor/kubearmor-client/commit/ec130453cee6fbdc7296b992d98171f93a47487c)\n\nExample:\n```\n$ ./karmor vm policy\nManage standalone (VM or bare???metal) KubeArmor security policies.\n\nThe \"policy\" command lets you add, delete, and later list or update enforcement rules \nwhen running KubeArmor outside a Kubernetes cluster. Policies are defined in YAML and \nsent over gRPC to the local KubeArmor agent.\n\nSubcommands:                                                                                 <- content of long description\n  ??? add     Apply a new policy from a YAML file (kubearmor vm policy add <file>)\n  ??? delete  Remove an existing policy by its YAML file (kubearmor vm policy delete <file>)\n\nGlobal Flags:                                                                                 <- content of long description\n  ??? --gRPC <address>   Address of the KubeArmor gRPC server (host:port)\n\nExamples:\n  # Apply a file???access policy on a standalone host:\n  karmor vm policy add ./file-access.yaml --gRPC 127.0.0.1:50051\n\n  # Remove that policy when finished:\n  karmor vm policy delete ./file-access.yaml --gRPC 127.0.0.1:50051\n\nSee each subcommand's help for more details:\n  karmor vm policy add --help\n  karmor vm policy delete --help\n\nUsage:\n  karmor vm policy [command]\n\nAvailable Commands:                                                                            <- generated by Cobra\n  add         add policy for non kubernetes/bare metal KubeArmor\n  delete      delete policy for non kubernetes/bare metal KubeArmor\n  get         get policy for bare-metal vm/kvms control plane vm\n\nFlags:                                                                                         <- generated by Cobra\n      --gRPC string   gRPC server information\n  -h, --help          help for policy\n\nGlobal Flags:                                                                                  <- generated by Cobra\n      --context string      Name of the kubeconfig context to use\n      --kubeconfig string   Path to the kubeconfig file to use\n\nUse \"karmor vm policy [command] --help\" for more information about a command.\n```\nManually added Long description currently contains:\n\n- Description of command\n- Subcommands: add, delete, etc.\n- Global Flags: --gRPC, etc.\n- Example Usage\n\nThese are also automatically rendered by Cobra, making their inclusion in Long unnecessary. We only need Description and Example Usage\n\n## Proposed Change:\nRefactor the Long descriptions for CLI commands to contain only:\n\n- Command overview\n- Example for usage\n\nRemove manually added subcommands and global flags from the long description.\n\nThis will ensure the CLI help remains clean, DRY, and easier to maintain.\n\nThanks!",

Luckily the AI search bot will provide a clue when prompting it \"loginWithToken\", linking to a guide page about sharing authentication using a new AccountsClient instance `accounts2.loginWithToken`, from which can be inferred that `Accounts.loginWithToken` exists.\n\nOne thing that isn't clear though is that it does not accept an expiry value. So what happens if calling that on multi clients in the same machine in the same browser. Will they all have differing expiration dates?\n\nFor example suppose I have two separate clients at ex.com and sub.ex.com and when one logs in I set `Meteor.loginToken` on the other using a temporary iframe, then the other detects the added token and calls `Accounts.loginWithToken`. I think they'll both be signed in, but Meteor will try to set a new expiry for the new login I'm guessing. \n\nPlaying with this right now...", "... oh cool, after playing with it, I noticed that Meteor is already polling local storage on the client for a `Meteor.loginToken`, so all I need to do is simply call `localStorage.setItem('Meteor.loginToken', '....')` and Meteor detects it, and I see that Meteor will have the same expiration value on both clients (guessing it must've got that from the server). Cool! That's real easy! Don't even need `Accounts.loginWithToken` for this (multi-client auth on differing subdomains).", "\uD83D\uDC4B @italojs This issue has been open for 60 days with no activity.

      "description" : "## Please help us translate Ghost to your language!\n\n### General needs\n- Contribute new languages (provided you speak them fluently or near-fluently)\n- Help complete languages that are only partially translated\n- Improve the quality of existing translations\n- Fix errors (see below)\n\n### Notes & tips\n\n\uD83D\uDD16 For help getting started, see https://forum.ghost.org/t/help-translate-ghost-beta/37461 - the original directions were only for portal, but can be generalized to any language file.\n\n\uD83E\uDD16 **NO AI translations, please**. Native/very fluent speakers only.\n\n??? **Read your email!**  Please make sure you have your Github notifications sent somewhere you will see them.  Most PRs need at least one round of adjustment before merging.  \n\n\uD83C\uDD95 New Github users are welcome!  When you submit your PR, please make sure that the \"files changed\" tab shows only the changes you intended to make.  If you have questions, please leave a comment and I'll try to help get you sorted out. \n\n\uD83D\uDC4B **Formality**: Ghost's brand has a friendly and fairly informal tone.  If your language has both formal and informal form, choose one or the other and use it consistently.  Most languages are using the informal version, but if the informal version might be considered rude, then choose the formal.\n\n\uD83E\uDD17  All kinds of people use Ghost.  When possible, prefer gender-neutral language.\n\n\uD83D\uDC4D Translations should work for a variety of Ghost sites.  Choose translations that will make sense for both personal blogs/newsletters and news publications.  \n\n\uD83D\uDC49 Please @ cathysarisky if you add a language PR.  Thanks!\n\n### Common issues to avoid & other notes:\n- Please give your PR a descriptive title that includes the language you are working on.\n- Check before starting that there isn't another PR for the same language.  If there is, please review it rather than duplicating work.\n- Consult the [context.json](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/main/ghost/i18n/locales/context.json) file if you aren't sure how a string will be used.  \n- We use *\"Jamie Larson\"* for a placeholder in any field that needs a name.  Please do not transliterate.  Please do not replace with \"Name\".  Instead, choose a name that will be recognized as a name in your language.  Choose something uncontroversial and common.  If possible, choose a non-gendered name.\n- Do not translate variables (inside {}).  Do not add variables.  If you remove a variable, leave a note (see \"Known Errors\" below).\n- Watch out for \"You are receiving this because you are a <strong>%%{status}%% subscriber</strong> to {site}.'\", which takes the \"free\", \"trialing\", \"paid\", and \"complimentary\" strings in the %%{status}%% field.  These strings need to work together.\n- If you are changing existing translations, please leave an explanation of why. \n\n### Completion status (last generated 7/4/2025):\n\n| Language | Need translation | Completion % | Invalid Variables | Missing Variables | Intentional Overrides |\n|----------|------------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------|\n| Hungarian (hu) \uD83E\uDD47 | 0 | 100% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Punjabi (pa) \uD83E\uDD47 | 0 | 100% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Russian (ru) \uD83E\uDD47 | 0 | 100% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Spanish (es) \uD83E\uDD48 | 5 | 99% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Bulgarian (bg) \uD83E\uDD48 | 8 | 98% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Italian (it) \uD83E\uDD48 | 9 | 98% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Vietnamese (vi) \uD83E\uDD48 | 8 | 98% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Mongolian (mn) \uD83E\uDD49 | 13 | 97% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Polish (pl) \uD83E\uDD49 | 13 | 97% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Danish (da) \uD83E\uDD49 | 14 | 96% | 1 ??? | 0 | 0 |\n| German (de) \uD83E\uDD49 | 14 | 96% | 0 | 0 | 1 ??? |\n| Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR) \uD83E\uDD49 | 14 | 96% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Turkish (tr) \uD83E\uDD49 | 15 | 96% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Swiss German (de-CH) | 26 | 93% | 2 ??? | 3 ??? | 0 |\n| Norwegian Bokm??l (nb) | 28 | 93% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Slovenian (sl) | 27 | 93% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Catalan (ca) | 31 | 92% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Scottish Gaelic (gd) | 30 | 92% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Croatian (hr) | 30 | 92% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Latvian (lv) | 31 | 92% | 1 ??? | 0 | 0 |\n| Dutch (nl) | 29 | 92% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Chinese (Traditional) (zh-Hant) | 30 | 92% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Slovak (sk) | 34 | 91% | 0 | 1 ??? | 0 |\n| French (fr) | 37 | 90% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Arabic (ar) | 43 | 89% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Hebrew (he) | 41 | 89% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Korean (ko) | 41 | 89% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Swedish (sv) | 41 | 89% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Hindi (hi) | 65 | 83% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Indonesian (id) | 65 | 83% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Tamil (ta) | 65 | 83% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Ukrainian (uk) | 65 | 83% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Czech (cs) | 78 | 79% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Romanian (ro) | 81 | 78% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Portuguese (pt) | 85 | 77% | 0 | 1 ??? | 0 |\n| Estonian (et) | 101 | 73% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Chinese (Simplified) (zh) | 102 | 73% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Japanese (ja) | 108 | 71% | 0 | 2 ??? | 0 |\n| Serbian (Cyrillic) (sr-Cyrl) | 111 | 70% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Bosnian (bs) | 121 | 68% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Greek (el) | 121 | 68% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Persian (fa) | 121 | 68% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Kazakh (kz) | 121 | 68% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Lithuanian (lt) | 121 | 68% | 0 | 1 ??? | 0 |\n| Afrikaans (af) | 123 | 67% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Macedonian (mk) | 125 | 67% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Swahili (sw) | 125 | 67% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Bengali (bn) | 126 | 66% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Sinhala (si) | 128 | 66% | 2 ??? | 0 | 0 |\n| Thai (th) | 127 | 66% | 1 ??? | 0 | 0 |\n| Finnish (fi) | 135 | 64% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Urdu (ur) | 140 | 63% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Icelandic (is) | 192 | 49% | 1 ??? | 1 ??? | 0 |\n| Norwegian Nynorsk (nn) | 192 | 49% | 0 | 2 ??? | 0 |\n| Malay (ms) | 196 | 48% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Albanian (sq) | 204 | 46% | 0 | 2 ??? | 0 |\n| Nepali (ne) | 217 | 42% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Serbian (sr) | 234 | 38% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Esperanto (eo) | 295 | 22% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Uzbek (uz) | 295 | 22% | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n\n#### Known errors\nSome existing translations in ghost/i18n/locales/**/*.json may have errors in usage of variables.  Variables, surrounded by { } (always a single set, not doubles) should match in the key (left side) and value (right side). They should never translated.  New variables should *never* be added to the right side, as they will not be correctly substituted.  If a variable is not present on the right side, one should generally suspect an error, although a few may be deliberate.\n\nIf your language has any \"Invalid Variables\" listed above, these need to be corrected.  Your strings will not display correctly.  If your theme has \"Missing variables\", these might or might not be intentional.  You can edit the error tracking file below to update anything intentional to explain your choice.\n\nErrors are tracked in [ghost/i18n/test/i18n-ignores.json](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/main/ghost/i18n/test/i18n-ignores.json) .  If you correct an error, you can also delete the override.\n\n\n\n",

Create a Table chart \n2. Use as dimension a column that has a `<a>` tag applied in the Custom SQL section. It could be something like this `'<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q='  || Product_Category || '\">' || Product_Category || '</a>'`\n3. Save the chart in a dashboard and then use the Drill by feature in that column\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1e9a488-36c9-4cd4-abfd-4287a5847fba)\n\n## Expected results\nThe prompted window after using Drill by shows you the details of the category\n\n## Actual results\nThe prompted window after using Drill by doesn???t show anything\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e90c84b-6529-4c27-8afa-1cbca7fcb735)\n\n## Known Workarounds\nNo workarounds are currently known\n\n### Screenshots/recordings\n\n_No response_\n\n### Superset version\n\nmaster / latest-dev\n\n### Python version\n\n3.9\n\n### Node version\n\n16\n\n### Browser\n\nChrome\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Checklist\n\n- [x] I have searched Superset docs and Slack and didn't find a solution to my problem.\n- [x] I have searched the GitHub issue tracker and didn't find a similar bug report.\n- [ ] I have checked Superset's logs for errors and if I found a relevant Python stacktrace, I included it here as text in the \"additional context\" section.",

The root cause is that when you use Drill by on a table cell, Superset passes the raw SQL value (which includes the HTML markup) as the filter value, rather than the plain text label that???s displayed to users. Since the filter value includes the HTML, it doesn???t match the expected values in the dataset, so no results are shown. The table chart does sanitize and render HTML for display, but the Drill by logic doesn???t strip HTML before filtering, which causes this disconnect??[reference](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/21d8d57380bcc67bab8e603fda99ffbc4a7dcac2/superset-frontend/plugins/plugin-chart-table/src/TableChart.tsx).\n\nThere isn???t a built-in workaround right now. To address this, the code that handles Drill by/context menu events should strip HTML tags from the filter value before applying the filter. The codebase already includes utilities for HTML sanitization and tag removal, so this would be a straightforward fix for a developer familiar with the frontend code??[reference](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/21d8d57380bcc67bab8e603fda99ffbc4a7dcac2/superset-frontend/plugins/plugin-chart-table/src/utils/formatValue.ts).\n\nNo existing tickets or documentation specifically address this scenario, but the technical root cause is clear from the code. If you need to use Drill by on these columns, you???ll need to avoid embedding HTML in the dimension values, or consider a code change to strip HTML before filtering.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

I'd like to work on this issue.

I think this provides better flexibility as our `useTanstackQueryShape` could receive optimistic updates from several mutations.\n\nWhat do you think of this approach?

      "description" : "### Context\n\nOpenVINO works in Node.js environment!\nWe are looking for new contributors who can help with enabling C++ API methods \nin JavaScript side.\n\nFirst of all read Node.js API [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/src/bindings/js/node/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n#### Task Details\n\nExpose `ov::Model::get_ops()` method. \nFrom JavaScript side it will be `Model.getOps()` method.\nThis method:\n- Doesn't have parameters\n- Returns array of `ov::Node` objects\n  Node.js API doesn't have bindings for `ov::Node`. You need implement bindings \n  for it. `ov::Node` has a lot of methods, you shouldn't implement all of them.\n  Implement:\n  - [ov::Node::get_name()](https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/api/c_cpp_api/classov_1_1_node.html#_CPPv4NK2ov4Node8get_nameEv)\n  This method don't have parameters, it should be easy to bind it.\n\n#### Useful links\n\n- C++ API [implementation](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/src/core/src/model.cpp#L416) of `Model::get_ops()` method\n- Node.js API has similar implementation for `Output<ov::Node>`, use this as the\n  reference to implement `ov::Node` class.\n\n### What needs to be done?\n\n- Create `NodeWrap` class that inherits from `Napi::ObjectWrap` and represents `ov::Node`, create a separate header and source file.\n- Implement `NodeWrap` as minimal wrapper of `ov::Node` with [ov::Node.get_name()](https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/api/c_cpp_api/classov_1_1_model.html#_CPPv4NK2ov5Model5cloneEv) method.\n- Add `ModelWrap.get_ops()` method to [./src/bindings/js/node/src/model_wrap.cpp](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/src/bindings/js/node/src/model_wrap.cpp)\n- Update TypeScript definitions in [./src/bindings/js/node/lib/addon.ts](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/src/bindings/js/node/lib/addon.ts)\n- Create unit test for added functionality using Node.js Test Runner. It might look similar to this (Python code as an example):\n\n```python\n  model_operators = [op.get_name().split(\"_\")[0] for op in model.get_ops()]\n     expected_ops = [\n         \"Subtract\",\n         \"Transpose\",\n     ]\n     assert len(model_operators) == 14\n     for op in expected_ops:\n         assert op in model_operators\n```\n\n### How to take this issue\n\nTo take this issue leave text: `.take` as the comment in this issue.\nIt will assign this issue to you automatically. Please, make sure that the issue has the status **Contributors Needed** and doesn't have another user in Assingnees.\n\n### Example Pull Requests\n\n - https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/pull/23743\n - https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/pull/24023\n\n#### You may use this unfinished PR as the reference\n \n - https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/pull/25470\n\n### Resources\n\n- [[NEW] Contribution Guide](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/src/bindings/js/node/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n- [JavaScript API Developer Documentation](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/src/bindings/js/docs/README.md#openvino-node-package-developer-documentation)\n- [Node.js API Reference](https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/api/nodejs_api/addon.html)\n- [Node.js bindings examples of usage](https://github.com/nodejs/node-addon-examples)\n- [What is OpenVINO?](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino#what-is-openvino-toolkit)\n- [How to contributing to OpenVINO](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n- [User documentation](https://docs.openvino.ai/)\n\n### Contact points\n\n@almilosz @vishniakov-nikolai \n\nPlease, mention us in this issue discussion if you have any questions.\n",

      "description" : "### Description\n\nExtend glob pattern matching support similar to .gitignore in .airflowignore \n\n### Use case/motivation\n\nI recently upgraded Airflow from version 2.6.2 to 2.9.2 and noticed a change in version 2.6.3 related to .airflowignore handling. My requirement is to exclude everything except certain folders within the dags_folder path. Previously, I achieved this using pattern `^(?!(foo|bar)).*` with the default `dag_ignore_file_syntax = regexp`. However, after the upgrade, this approach stopped working because Google's RE2 engine doesn't seem to support `(?!)` as expected. I attempted switching `dag_ignore_file_syntax = glob` and observed that the current glob support is very limited. Hence requesting this feature to provide similar functionality as of .gitignore where I can define the pattern like `!{foo/*,bar/*}`.\n\n### Related issues\n\nNA\n\n### Are you willing to submit a PR?\n\n- [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n",

The current SDK  uses uppercase and hyphens in the header names, which leads to this metadata validation error.\n\nTo fix it we need to change \n\n### 1. In client.py\n\n```python\n# gRPC authentication headers (from Go SDK)\nHEADER_CALLER_ID = \"ONLINE-FEATURE-STORE-CALLER-ID\"\nHEADER_CALLER_TOKEN = \"ONLINE-FEATURE-STORE-AUTH-TOKEN\"\n```\n\nto \n\n```python\n# gRPC authentication headers (from Go SDK)\nHEADER_CALLER_ID = \"online_feature_store_caller_id\"\nHEADER_CALLER_TOKEN = \"online_feature_store_auth_token\"\n```\n\n### 2. On server side on middle-ware we need to handle accordingly for extracting and authenticating headers\n```go\nonst (\n\tAuthToken       = \"AUTH_TOKEN\"\n\tcallerIdHeader  = \"online-feature-store-caller-id\"\n\tAuthTokenHeader = \"online-feature-store-auth-token\"\n)\n\nfunc ServerInterceptor(ctx context.Context, req any, info *grpc.UnaryServerInfo, handler grpc.UnaryHandler) (resp any, err error) {\n\tstartTime := time.Now()\n\tmd, ok := metadata.FromIncomingContext(ctx)\n\tif !ok {\n\t\treturn nil, status.Errorf(codes.InvalidArgument, \"mandatory metadata are missing\")\n\t}\n\tcallerId, ok := md[callerIdHeader]\n\tif !ok {\n\t\treturn nil, status.Errorf(codes.InvalidArgument, \"%s header is missing\", callerIdHeader)\n\t}\n\tauthHeader, ok := md[AuthTokenHeader]\n\tif !ok {\n\t\treturn nil, status.Errorf(codes.InvalidArgument, \"%s header is missing\", AuthTokenHeader)\n\t}\n```\n\nFor backward compatibility with go client we need to assume\n\n```go\ncallerIdHeader  as \"online-feature-store-caller-id\" | \"online_feature_store_caller_id\"\nAuthTokenHeader as \"online-feature-store-auth-token\" | \"online_feature_store_auth_token\"\n```\n", "@AryAgarwal  if you???re interested, feel free to raise a PR with the fix, it should mostly involve replacing the header keys options.

I thought the R-text referred to the left input, not to down input.\n\nsome edits to an existing circuit might cause some registers stop working, the output stored value not changing. sometimes the register starts with ?? value. resetting to 0 value with the pin sets it to 0, but the clock storing line does not activate value storage. restart and reload of the same circuit was required to get simulation working again.", "Thanks for your feedback @goofyseeker311! However, you are mixing too many topics in this issue. Please keep each issue focused to a single aspect. You can specify relationships between issues to link them if needed. Therefore, I ask you to file new issues from your second comment so that they can be independently discussed.\n\nRegarding the limited width of the select input of plexer components. The limitation to 5 bit wide selection inputs (choice among 32 inputs/outputs is for many practical situations sufficient. It was also in line with the maximum word width of 32 bits. The maximum bus width was increased to 64 bit some time ago. So, it may make sense to increase the width to 6 bits. The main reason for the current limitation to 5 bit is of a practical nature: The component symbol needs to scale with the number of inputs/outputs addressed via the select input. Too big symbols are hard to handle in schematic entry. Each new bit would double the size of the plexers. Therefore, an increase to 6 bit or 8 bit might be feasible, but not beyond that.\n\nAnyway, such wide plexers would be typically used in memories and for these applications, we have dedicated RAM/ROM component models. The Bit Selector component might be also suitable in some cases, but is limited to a 64-bit-wide input. If you have a concrete needs, please describe them in more detail so that we can evaluate if your enhancement request is in line with the goal of this project.\n\nPRs to address this and your other issues are welcome!\n\nPS: Showing the values on all signals by default is less practical than one might think at first glance. Once circuits grow in complexity such additional elements on the screen become distracting. Additionally, the required additional paint operation would limit the simulator performance considerably.\n\nPPS: The Write Enable (WE) input of data registers behaves consistently to its specification in the documentation and the expected behaviour of such components in reality. WE needs to be active before the active edge selected via the Trigger attribute. Only, when you choose the Trigger to be level-sensitive, you obtain latch behaviour, where WE is also evaluated during the active level of the enable input due to the transparent nature of latches in this mode.\n\nPPPS: Finally, the problems you observe while doing edits during an active simulation: We fixed several issues in this area since the last official release. Please, check whether the problem persists in our [Nightly builds](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution?tab=readme-ov-file#nightly-builds).\n\n\n\n", "my design requires at least 8-bit mux (would equal 256 output lines, 32-bit and 64-bit might be a bit too large, unless you have a linear array type massive memory cell output). the value being next to the data line by default/option would make debugging more simple, for me at least.\n\nall these are from my viewpoint, not from any other viewpoint. just reporting in usability and other issues at once. all other issues were \"resolved\" by getting to know how some non-intuitive choices of ui actually work. this issue deals with how components work in general.\n\nedit: if logisim-evolution will not support up to 8-bit mux, then I might put two such things serially to add virtual 10-bit mux. ie 4-bit to 16x 4-bit muxes to get full 8-bit mux.\n\nimo: not often used is an excuse for missing feature.", "> my design requires at least 8-bit mux (would equal 256 output lines, 32-bit and 64-bit might be a bit too large, unless you have a linear array type massive memory cell output). \n\nIt is not planned to extend the maximum bus width beyond 64 bit.

PRs to implement this enhancement are welcome.\n", "It is easy to change the maximum size of the select pin for the plexers. I tried it with 6, 7, and 8. Of course, setting it to 8 results in a very large component with 256 inputs. I'll make a PR.\n\n@maehne: Should it be set to 6, 7, or 8? There doesn't seem to be an efficiency concern with going bigger since it makes no difference unless a bigger value is selected. And then it takes longer to draw the image and has more hot spots in the circuit state, but it is actually less work in simulation and drawing than building it with several plexers, assuming it is really needed." ],

Java generator is covered by at least one integration test  \n- ??? Generated Java code compiles and passes basic execution  \n- ??? Integration test runs as part of the CI suite  \n- ??? Test follows the documented integration testing structure\n\n---\n\n### Additional Notes\n\nAdding Java integration tests ensures that changes to the generator do not silently introduce regressions and increases confidence in the CLI's language support matrix.\n",

So I personally cannot test or add this feature. But I agree this is a very important aspect, and would be useful if you have a compatible device. I may be able to implement this if I have a valid JSON example from the endpoint (it's not available via the python-garminconnect directly, but we can always make the request with `garmin_obj.connectapi(endpoint)` )\n\nI am marking this as good first issue for other people to have a look. The goal is to figure out the endpoint for temperature tracking and writing a function to extract this and add it under the sleep measurement on influxDB so it can be visualized alongside. ", "If you could give me some hints how to do this, I can definitely give it a try to provide you all the info you need!\n", "If you have a little python background, that should be possible. Check out [python-garminconnect](https://github.com/cyberjunky/python-garminconnect) project! Then you need to open the data browser, inspect the page and reload it to see the request endpoints for the temperature data page. Then you can try out that path with the python-garminconnect package, by using the connectapi() method. " ],

It would be amazing if you could integrate that. Below the endpoints:\n\n1. Campaign API:\n- Create Campaign\nThe Create Campaign API lets you create campaigns in CleverTap. For example, you can use this endpoint to send a push notification to a specific set of users based on their past behaviour in the app. You can also target your campaigns based on segments that match user profile properties you define.\n- Stop Campaign\nThe Stop Campaign API enables you to stop scheduled/running campaigns.\n- Get Campaign Report\nThe Get Campaign Report API lets you get performance metrics about a specific campaign.\n- Get Campaigns\nThe Get Campaigns API lets you get a list of campaigns created using the API.\n\nThanks in advance!

      "description" : "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Problem description\n\nWhat is missing (and is available in most CAD software) is to align the camera view to a selected reference in the 3D view, with a dedicated button in the core toolbar.\n\nIn the sketcher there is a button to align the 3D view to the plane of the sketch, so why not allow this as a core function in FreeCAD. It would be helpful in many WB, to make splits in Curves WB (always from the viewing angle), activate clipping planes, ...\n\nThere is a macro for this I have found in the Addon Manager \"Align View to Face\" https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Macro_Align_View_to_Face which works good for faces and datums but I have to install it on every machine and create a custom button for it. Would this be a start to merge this function and eventually update its features?\n\nThe align view to reference tool should align the camera to the previous selection:\n\n- Faces and Datums > Normal view (like the macro does today)\n- If the camera view already matches the selection, maybe reverse it to view from behind (- normal direction) or a button (even in dropdown menu of the new button) to reverse it.\n- Allow the selection of edges, lines and axes and set their direction to the normal position of the camera view\n- Allow the view to be aligned to current clipping planes\n- Replace ViewSketch with the new tool and set it to the active sketch plane https://wiki.freecad.org/Sketcher_ViewSketch\n- Maybe run a \"FitSelection\" command after setting the view rotation to get the whole selection in focus\n\n---\n\n- [x] One Face\n- [x] One Line\n- [x] Datums (axis/plane)\n- [x] Origin objects (axis system and default planes for bodies and part objects)\n- [x] If one line is a curve or circle and laying in one dimension / plane --> use this normal direction\n- [ ] If the camera view already matches the selection, maybe reverse it to view from behind (- normal direction) or a button (even in dropdown menu of the new button) to reverse it.\n- [ ] Multiple faces (average direction)\n- [ ] Average normal of curved surfaces\n- [ ] Multiple lines (if they lay on one common plane (always with selection of 2 straight lines), align to this plane's normal)\n- [ ] Allow the view to be aligned to current clipping planes\n- [ ] Replace ViewSketch with the new tool and set it to the active sketch plane https://wiki.freecad.org/Sketcher_ViewSketch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Full version info\n\n```shell\nOS: Windows 11 build 22621\nWord size of FreeCAD: 64-bit\nVersion: 0.22.0dev.34810 (Git)\nBuild type: Release\nBranch: main\nHash: 196cbecde66a1c3a1b56b8c532ad1faedff4818b\nPython 3.10.13, Qt 5.15.8, Coin 4.0.0, Vtk 9.2.5, OCC 7.6.3\nLocale: German/Germany (de_DE)\nInstalled mods: \n  * 3DfindIT 1.2.0\n  * 3D_Printing_Tools\n  * BIM 2021.12.0\n  * CfdOF 1.24.7\n  * CurvedShapes 1.0.4\n  * Curves 0.6.14\n  * Defeaturing 1.2.1\n  * fasteners 0.4.68\n  * freecad.gears 1.0.0\n  * freecad_metal_workbench 0.0.1\n  * OpenDark 2023.10.30\n  * sheetmetal 0.3.1\n  * Silk 0.1.5\n```\n\n\n\n### Subproject(s) affected?\n\nNone\n\n### Anything else?\n\nhttps://wiki.freecadweb.org/Macro_Align_View_to_Face\nhttps://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=58695\nhttps://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=76717\nhttps://wiki.freecad.org/Macro_Align_Face_Object_to_View\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct",

It's probably easier to go deeper to fix it rather than write from scratch I guess.\r\n\r\nElse you need to handle all the cases. It is similar to the work I have done in assembly to position the joint coordinate systems. The logic is in 'findPlacement' function.

For now I am working on this:\n\n> If the camera view already matches the selection, maybe reverse it to view from behind (- normal direction) or a button (even in dropdown menu of the new button) to reverse it.\n\nI added a parameter to align to the reverse direction. It won't reverse if the camera view matches the selection because that could be confusing sometimes, better be explicit about this.

Could you also make the icon for the reverse align to selection please?\n", "@Rexbas thanks. I would help if I would know something. Which one would be the easiest of the missing ones?\nNot sure if we should do a separate command to have negative view. Workaround could always be: align to normal and the circle on the navi cube can flip the view. That I thought could the AlignToSelection do on a second click.\n\nWhen looking at the PR: not covered would be if I select 2 straight edges which would always be in one common plane (if they are not coincident)?", "Theses are probably the harder ones, currently the alignment code only considers one selection. So two edges are not yet considered.\n - [ ] Multiple faces (average direction)\n - [ ] Average normal of curved surfaces\n - [ ] Multiple lines (if they lay on one common plane (always with selection of 2 straight lines), align to this plane's normal)\n\n\n> That I thought could the AlignToSelection do on a second click.\n\nI tried this, it is possible but also a bit confusing. Sometimes I want to click on something and make sure I am aligned. But if I already am aligned then it goes to the opposite view which is a bit annoying. I am more a proponent of having a button that explicitly sets alignment form the front and one that explicitly sets alignment reversed. Maybe the @FreeCAD/design-working-group should weigh in about what would be better?\n\nI have two branches with the different implementations:\nhttps://github.com/Rexbas/FreeCAD/tree/reverse-align-selection\nhttps://github.com/Rexbas/FreeCAD/tree/auto-reverse-align\n\nCurrently having a quick look to see if I can replace ViewSketch with the new tool.\n" ],

TypeScript Compatibility: The project tests are written in TypeScript, since node:test doesn???t support TypeScript by default, I???ve been exploring options. I???ve found that tsx and ts-node can run TypeScript tests without precompiling, which is helpful. I???m also looking into test loaders but still need to test this setup.\n2. Test Reporting: Right now, the project uses tap-mocha-reporter, and I saw that node:test has a built-in JUnit reporter. I???m not sure how well it will work with TypeScript tests, so I may need to experiment to figure that out.\n3. Considering borp: I found a test runner called borp, which works with TypeScript and uses node:test. It seems like a good option since it also handles coverage with c8 and provides reporting tools. I???m wondering if switching to it might make things easier overall.\n\nI???d appreciate any thoughts you have on the best way to handle this, especially around TypeScript support and reporting.\n\nThanks!", "I actually `borp` for that specific reason.

      "description" : "### Describe the Bug\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what the bug is. -->\nWhen we generate the api response for events, we deliver the title of the associated location in the default language for the region. We don't account for the case when that translation does not exist for some reason, so instead of gracefully sending a response without the title or with a placeholder, instead the request is aborted with status code 500, not delivering any useful information.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Go to https://cms-test.integreat-app.de/api/v3/maintal/de/events/?combine_recurring=True\n2. See error\n\n### Expected Behavior\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen. -->\nGraceful failure: Even if we cannot deliver the title of the location in the regions default language, we should deliver everything else of the response. The location title could fall back to a non-truthy value like `null`, be an empty string or a placeholder value\n\n### Actual Behavior\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what actually happened. -->\nThe whole request *(in this case about multiple upcoming events)* is aborted with an *Internal Server Error*\n\n### Additional Information\n<!-- Add any other context (e.g. logs, etc.) about the problem here. -->\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Traceback</summary>\n\n```\nJul 06 09:00:24 ERROR   django.request - 500 Internal Server Error: /api/v3/maintal/de/events/?combine_recurring=True\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/opt/integreat-cms/.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/django/core/handlers/exception.py\", line 55, in inner\n    response = get_response(request)\n               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"/opt/integreat-cms/.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/django/core/handlers/base.py\", line 197, in _get_response\n    response = wrapped_callback(request, *callback_args, **callback_kwargs)\n               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"/opt/integreat-cms/.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/integreat_cms/api/decorators.py\", line 125, in wrap\n    return function(request, *args, **kwargs)\n           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"/opt/integreat-cms/.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/integreat_cms/api/v3/events.py\", line 225, in events\n    transform_event_translation(event_translation, poi_translation),\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"/opt/integreat-cms/.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/integreat_cms/api/v3/events.py\", line 99, in transform_event_translation\n    \"location\": transform_poi(event.location),\n                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"/opt/integreat-cms/.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/integreat_cms/api/v3/locations.py\", line 52, in transform_poi\n    \"name\": poi.default_public_translation.title,\n            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nAttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'title'\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### Related Issues\n<!-- A collection of all issues that are related to this issue and could be useful. -->\n<!-- Please also include the related integreat-app issues, if possible. -->\n\n\n\n### Summary of discussion and updates to the description\n<!-- Summarize the discussion if a long conversation was made that changed something.

      "comments" : [ "Hello and thank you for this issue! The core team regularly reviews new issues and discusses them, but this can take a little time. Please bear with us while we get to your issue. If you're interested, the contribution guide has a section about the [decision-making process](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#who-decides-if-a-feature-will-be-implemented-and-how-is-that-decision-made).", "Thanks for reporting this, @mikeg-de!\n\nThese appear to be the temporary locations where OpenTofu downloads a provider package archive before extracting it into the provider cache directory.\n\nThere _is_ some code that makes a best-effort to clean these up:\n\nhttps://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/blob/f8d128491c43e7b246d9de8538e21b383722beba/internal/getproviders/package_location_http_archive.go#L82-L87\n\nHowever, I notice you are using Windows and so I suspect that what you've observed might be caused by Windows preventing the file from being deleted while it's still open, whereas that is allowed on other platforms that OpenTofu supports.\n\nDue to how `defer` works in Go, these `defer` calls will be visited in _reverse order_ when the function exits, which means that OpenTofu is effectively calling `os.Remove` before it calls `os.Close`. Inverting these so that the `os.Close` call happens before the `os.Remove` call might be sufficient to make this work on Windows, if my theory is correct.\n\nThere's some similar treatment in the newly-added `PackageOCIBlobArchive` which seems like it'll have the same problem but for a slightly different reason:\n\nhttps://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/blob/f8d128491c43e7b246d9de8538e21b383722beba/internal/getproviders/package_location_oci_blob_archive.go#L138-L142\n\nIn this case there is _only_ a call to `os.Remove`, and the function is relying on the automatic cleanup that closes the underlying filehandle when an `os.File` object goes out of scope, which would therefore _also_ cause these steps to happen in the wrong order. If I was correct about the cause of the problem in `PackageHTTPURL` then we should update `PackageOCIBlobArchive` to follow the same pattern.\n\nIn the meantime: OpenTofu does not rely on these files after provider installation is complete, so you can manually delete them immediately if you need to reclaim that disk space.\n", "We are also skipping checking the return values of both of those functions, which is not ideal.  We should at least be logging the error to help diagnose issues like this one.", "can I work on this?", "Sure!  Thanks @KrishnaSindhur!\n\nPlease take a look through the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) before getting started.", "Hi,\n\nIt seems this issue has been inactive for a few weeks.\nWould it be okay if I go ahead and work on it, or is someone already actively handling it?\n\nThanks in advance!" ],

For Babel upgrades, [refer to this comment](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/pull/13802#issuecomment-2996187240). They are difficult to handle and need extensive verification from us. Some of the others may need work but are easier for us to verify, I believe.\n\nAs a side note, here???s why we avoid frequent dependency upgrades. Upgrading is more than bumping version numbers: minor or major updates can introduce breaking changes and silent errors that are not covered by our tests. Our tests may catch some issues but miss others, leaving problems for future releases. Larger version jumps increase risk. We've seen this in past upgrades. Dependency updates are routine maintenance, which we've done a lot in recent years. Since we???re now focused on modernization and new features, I prefer to avoid introducing new issues unless they cause proven harm or come via contributions. We can handle quick fixes, but using core team capacity for routine updates would delay the long-requested features that Meteor desperately needs.\n\nOn security, I'm not concerned about dev-tools upgrades. Runtime dependencies for Meteor apps pose the real risk, so Meteor package patches should come first. Dev-tool vulnerabilities rarely affect development machines. I???d rather keep the Meteor tool stable as we modernize than chase time-consuming updates with no visible benefit. [I updated some in a separate branch](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/compare/devel...DEBT-update-tools-dependencies) to check performance with `meteor profile`, but saw no benefit and prefered to avoid any side-effect for this moment.\n\nAfter we complete Meteor???s [next major and most exciting roadmap milestones](https://docs.meteor.com/about/roadmap), which are our current focus, we can dedicate more effort to this kind of maintenance ourselves. I???ll discuss this with the team. We may add a dev-tool maintenance item to the roadmap.\n\nThat said, I encourage contributors to work on these upgrades in separate PRs, referring to the relevant upgrade changelogs and ensuring full migration and delivery, including addresing reviews, test coverage, and other guidence. We can support them and, based on each change set???s criticality, map out the steps needed for complete verification to be candidate for next releases.", "can i work on this issue if you want someone to do this" ],

I'd like to help with this issue.\nI???ve read through the original issue #893 and understand that the goal is to ensure that copy constructors (e.g., in classes like TaskCommentImpl, ObjectReferenceImpl, etc.) copy all relevant fields by value and not reference ??? and omit persistence-related IDs where needed.\n\nWould it be okay if I take on this task? I???ll start by reviewing all *Impl entity classes and correcting the constructors where necessary.", "> Would it be okay if I take on this task? I???ll start by reviewing all *Impl entity classes and correcting the constructors where necessary.\n\nHey Omar! Certainly, go ahead :)\nI am looking forward to reviewing your Pull-Request!", "Hi!\n\nI'm currently working on the issue, and I came across a situation that could use your input.\n\nIn some classes like `TaskSummaryImpl`, fields such as `classificationSummary`, `workbasketSummary`, `primaryObjRef`, and the list of `attachmentSummaries` are currently being copied by reference inside the copy constructor.\n\nWhile reviewing this, I attempted to improve those constructors by using the `copy()` method provided by these fields. However, I noticed that the `copy()` methods intentionally omit persistence-related fields such as `id` and `taskId`. This behavior is now causing some tests (e.g., `TaskModelsCloneTest.testCloneInTaskSummary`) to fail, since the copied objects no longer retain those values.\n\nI???d like to confirm what direction to take moving forward. Here are a few possible approaches:\n\n* Option 1: Use a new `copyWithIds()` method (or similar)\nInstead of modifying `copy()`, introduce a method like `copyWithIds()` to explicitly include identifiers like `id` and `taskId` when needed (e.g., in UI or test layers).\n\n* Option 2: Modify the tests (they may be assuming too much)\nIf the design of `copy()` intentionally excludes persistence fields, perhaps the tests should be updated to reflect that ??? e.g., not asserting equality on `id` or `taskId` for copied objects.\n\n* Option 3: Keep the current copy-by-reference behavior\nIf copying by reference is acceptable for now (even if not ideal), we could leave the copy constructors as they are to avoid breaking tests or logic relying on shared object identity.\n\nLet me know which approach you'd prefer before I proceed with any changes.\nThanks in advance!", "Great finding Omar, I love the outlining of the options!\n\nWe will go with Option 3 and keep the by-reference behavior for all related attribute-entities. Non-Entity attributes like those of type `Instant` should still be copied by-value.\n\n(Actually quite interesting philosophically: If you as a father had children and I copied you, who'd be the father of them children? Or do I also need to copy the children?)" ],

Open the app and try to log in with your username and password\n3. An email verification input field should appear\n4. Make sure email verification input field is focused\n5. Tap on the `Enter` button in the software keyboard of Android\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nThe **IME Action** for the email verification input field should be either `Done` or `Go`. Also, the input field's height shouldn't increase when pressing the `Enter` button.\n\n### Actual behaviour\n\nThe `Enter` **IME Action** is displayed in the Android's soft keyboard, and tapping that increases the input field's height.\n\n### Device name\n\nPixel 6\n\n### Android version\n\nAndroid 14\n\n### Commons app version\n\nMain Branch\n\n### Device logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### Screen-shots\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7177768-7721-405e-a838-90b12a1a6a9c\n\n### Would you like to work on the issue?\n\nPrefer not",

This doesn't handle scenarios where services need progressively longer recovery times.\n\n### Design\nAdd an `exponentialBackoff` boolean field to enable exponential backoff behavior:\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n  - name: check-service\n    command: curl -f https://api.example.com/health\n    repeatPolicy:\n      intervalSec: 1          # Initial interval\n      limit: 5                # Max attempts\n      exponentialBackoff: true  # Enable exponential backoff\n      exitCode: [1]           # Repeat on failure\n```\n\n**Behavior:**\n- 1st retry: 1s\n- 2nd retry: 2s  \n- 3rd retry: 4s\n- 4th retry: 8s\n- 5th retry: 16s\n\n### Implementation\n1. Add `ExponentialBackoff bool` to `RepeatPolicy` struct in `/internal/digraph/step.go`\n2. Update scheduler logic in `/internal/digraph/scheduler/scheduler.go:334` to calculate interval as: `interval * (2^retryCount)`\n3. Use existing `node.State().DoneCount` to track retry attempts\n",

Some use-sites might be able to get away with using these fields as non-null and lead to crashes, like https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/12401\n\nThis could have been caught early on if the `ListExtractor` function correctly indicated the nullable behavior of the returned value. Also, given the app is being rewritten in Kotlin, so the correct annotation would enforce the nullability handling at use-site.\n\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe `ListExtractor` shall correctly indicate the Nullable annotation for it's fields\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Screenshots/Screen recordings\n\n_No response_\n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_",

But in the attempt to unblock someone, I'm looking externally at how something like auth0 operates. They have the option to use a webview to maintain a universal session independent of app or web on the same device (in the same default browser), you might consider reviewing auth0's approach to intercepting and consuming web redirects back into your native app, and utilizing that same webview for token refreshes.

In this issue, we want to improve the UI, add the company logos to it. We still want to maintain all functionality. \n\n<img width=\"1115\" height=\"487\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98396644-714d-42cb-80be-01e2c9a7b3be\" />\n\n## How to fix\n1. The settings page lives in `SettingsTab.tsx`. Each individual expandable card is a `ProviderSection.tsx` component. \n2. Refactor the UI of the card, while still maintaining its core functionality. Make the UI minimalist and simple to use. \n3. Add Claude / OpenAI logos to the cards (this is a nice plus) \n\n## First time contributing?\nPlease checkout our [CONTRIBUTIONS.md](https://github.com/MCPJam/inspector/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions on how to set up as a contributor.",

I have a small (very silly) question.\nThe `filter()` function in p5.js typically relies on its own built-in GLSL shaders. When you mention adding examples for p5.strands under `filter()`, do you mean writing a custom shader that leverages strands internally and showcasing that, and then using `filter()` function in the whole sketch created? I???m not quite sure how best to place strands examples inside the `filter()` reference?\n\nIn short, are you thinking creating sketches using p5.Strands and then using `filter()`? ", "> In short, are you thinking creating sketches using p5.Strands and then using `filter()`?\n\nI think so, to give users another potential way to discover strands (through looking up `filter`) in the examples.\n\nThere's a potential separate task we could do in the future where we replace the internal filter implementations with p5.strands versions, but I'll save that for a different issue \uD83D\uDE42 ", "hii, i am interested in this issue. can you please, assign it to  me\n" ],

      "description" : "## Summary\n\nThe Jupyter tab in OpenHands was not displaying input commands, only showing outputs. This made the Jupyter experience appear broken or incomplete, as users could see the results of IPython commands but not the commands themselves.\n\n## Environment\n\n- **OpenHands Version**: Latest (main branch)\n- **Runtime**: All runtimes with Jupyter support\n- **Browser**: All browsers\n- **Affected Component**: Frontend Jupyter tab\n\n## Bug Description\n\n### Expected Behavior\nThe Jupyter tab should display both:\n1. Input commands (the Python code being executed)\n2. Output results (the execution results)\n\n### Actual Behavior\nThe Jupyter tab only displayed:\n1. ??? Input commands: Missing\n2. ??? Output results: Working correctly\n\n### Impact\n- Users couldn't see what commands were being executed\n- Jupyter tab appeared broken or non-functional\n- Poor user experience for data analysis workflows\n- Made it difficult to understand the agent's Python code execution\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe issue was in the frontend action handling logic in `frontend/src/services/actions.ts`. The system was missing handling for `RUN_IPYTHON` actions to add input to the Jupyter state.\n\n**Missing Code:**\n```typescript\nif (message.action === ActionType.RUN_IPYTHON) {\n  store.dispatch(appendJupyterInput(message.args.code));\n}\n```\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Start OpenHands with Jupyter enabled\n2. Ask an agent to run Python code (e.g., \"Create a simple plot using matplotlib\")\n3. Navigate to the Jupyter tab\n4. Observe that only outputs are shown, not the input commands\n\n## Fix\n\nFixed in PR #9533\n\n## Labels\n\n- bug\n- frontend\n- jupyter\n- good first issue",

      "description" : "### Context\n\n[JIT Emitters](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/emitters/README.md) are part of code generation feature (a.k.a. tensor compiler) that automatically produces highly-efficient optimized fused subgraph binary code. Each emitter implements specific operation from low level OpenVINO dialect.\n\n### Prerequisites\nDue to limited resources, cross compilation is preferred option now for building OpenVINO targeting RISC-V development boards. Please see the documentation [\"Cross compile OpenVINO??? Runtime for RISCV64 systems\"](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/docs/dev/build_riscv64.md) for more details. For this work, you need to build [`xuantie-gnu-toolchain`](https://github.com/XUANTIE-RV/) or [`riscv-gnu-toolchain`](https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain.git) with `QEMU` support for emulation. So you don't need to have RISC-V development board even to contribute to OpenVINO for these platforms \uD83D\uDE03 \n\n### What needs to be done?\n\n* Create `fp32` [Tanh](https://docs.openvino.ai/2025/documentation/openvino-ir-format/operation-sets/operation-specs/arithmetic/tanh-1.html) operation [JIT Emitter](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/emitters/plugin/riscv64/jit_eltwise_emitters.hpp) for RISCV64 platform with RVV1.0 support. Use OpenVINO [CPU plugin JIT emitters](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/emitters/README.md) documentation and [RISC-V \"V\" Vector Extension](https://github.com/riscvarchive/riscv-v-spec/releases/tag/v1.0) documentation for details.\n* Support your implemented JIT Emitter in the [JIT Executor](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/4ebe493140b90cbaaa68e2c71fe8e1dbd7461822/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/nodes/eltwise.cpp#L805).\n* Modify [RISCV64 kernel](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/4ebe493140b90cbaaa68e2c71fe8e1dbd7461822/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/nodes/kernels/riscv64/jit_uni_eltwise_generic.hpp#L19) (in both places: [create_eltwise_emitter](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/4ebe493140b90cbaaa68e2c71fe8e1dbd7461822/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/nodes/kernels/riscv64/jit_uni_eltwise_generic.cpp#L401) and [get_supported_precisions](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/4ebe493140b90cbaaa68e2c71fe8e1dbd7461822/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/nodes/kernels/riscv64/jit_uni_eltwise_generic.cpp#L528)) to apply developed JIT emitter.\n\nBefore emitter implementation, please, modify tests to be sure that developed functionality is covered by test:\n * Add `jit` kernel check in [activation](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/0a177ff48a7197bee7eeb08f4e81b9d0ce8db271/src/plugins/intel_cpu/tests/functional/custom/single_layer_tests/classes/activation.cpp#L229) test, the test must fail.\n* If test doesn't fail then add supported operation in [CPU activation test instantiation](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/0a177ff48a7197bee7eeb08f4e81b9d0ce8db271/src/plugins/intel_cpu/tests/functional/custom/single_layer_tests/classes/activation.cpp#L263) if it's absent.\n\n### Tests\nTests are disabled in default build, so ensure to add `-DENABLE_TESTS=ON` into cmake command during the project configuration.\n\n[GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest) is used for testing. CPU functional test target is [ov_cpu_func_tests](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/tree/master/src/plugins/intel_cpu/tests/functional). You can use `GoogleTest` filter:\n```sh\n# If you use xuantie-gnu-toolchain:\n<xuantie_install_path>/bin/qemu-riscv64 -cpu rv64,x-v=true,vext_spec=v1.0 ./bin/[platform]/[build_type]/ov_cpu_func_tests --gtest_filter=\"*smoke*Activation*Tanh*\"\n\n# If you use riscv-gnu-toolchain:\n<riscv_install_path>/bin/qemu-riscv64 -cpu rv64,v=true,vext_spec=v1.0 ./bin/[platform]/[build_type]/ov_cpu_func_tests --gtest_filter=\"*smoke*Activation*Tanh*\"\n```\n\n### Example Pull Requests\n\n* [Abs](https://docs.openvino.ai/2025/documentation/openvino-ir-format/operation-sets/operation-specs/arithmetic/abs-1.html) operation: https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/pull/30218\n\n\n### Resources\n\n- [Contribution guide - start here!](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n- [What is OpenVINO?](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino#what-is-openvino-toolkit)\n- [CPU plugin JIT emitters](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/emitters/README.md)\n- [Blog post on contributing to OpenVINO](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n- [User documentation](https://docs.openvino.ai/)\n- [Intel DevHub Discord channel](https://discord.gg/7pVRxUwdWG) - engage in discussions, ask questions and talk to OpenVINO developers\n- [How to link your Pull Request to an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#manually-linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-the-pull-request-sidebar)\n-  [\"Cross compile OpenVINO???

      "comments" : [ "> Current /p command could become /p. or something like that, to indicate that it reads pattern from the current seek.\n\nThat's not what `/p` currently does. I should have made a better example, didn't think it could be misinterpreted this way.\n\nBetter description for current `/p n` would be \"search n byte patterns which show up in binary  more than once\". \n\n` /p 3` on \"ABCFABCGIIABC\" would return positions for \"ABC\", but it would also do the same when run on \"xyzABCFABCGIIABC\". \n\nIn case of `/p 3` run on \"mxyzabckabcxyzxyz\" it woud report \"xyz\" 3 positions, \"abc\" 2 positions because both of them can be found more than once. Current seek doesn't matter.\n\n\nAlso I am not sure if rest of your suggestion makes sense. The word pattern is a bit overloaded here. Just because 2 command descriptions contain word \"pattern\" doesn't mean they are related or that the type of patterns are in any way related.\n\nSome of the `pp` patterns like pp0 and ppf which make some sense to search are already better covered by `/x` and `/xr`  .\n\n`pp8 n` prints n words each incremented by one starting with current seek position (not the content) . `pp1` -`pp4` doe the same just limiting to lower 1-4 address bytes of current seek position. What do you expect to be searched ? Whole ascending number sequence or any of the words?\n\n`ppd` assuming it refers to de Brujin  sequence and there aren't multiple things named after him, why would you want to search for it in an executable. In specific situations it's useful strategy for trying every combination in less steps by overlaping the values, but searching for the pattern itself in binary makes little sense to me. Searching if executable contains hard coded (in the target executable)  de Brujin sequence, is no better than having a dedicated search command for Fibonacci sequence or nth digit of pi.\n\nAs  side note, seems like the `ppd` command currently itself is kind of buggy. `ppd 2` currently prints `4141` which is not a proper de Brujin sequence.  Based on what it prints for larger values I guess that `ppd n` prints \"the first n bytes in B([A-Za-z], 3) encoded as ascii bytes\". Maybe it's B(A-Za-z, 2) or something similar, hard to tell precisely by just eyeballing it. Partial de Brujin sequence has little value, and not being able to choose alphabet size or word length as makes the current implementation of command useless.\n\nHaving search commands for `ppa` and `ppn` also seems questionable due to the same reasons as de Brujin sequence.\n\nThe implementation of them also seem kind of buggy.\n\n`ppn` starts printing 4 digit codes in  LSB order from 0-99 (0000-9900) then jumps back to 0000 0000  1000-9000 (repeated twice in addition to being at the start of sequence)  and after a while it finally starts setting 3rd digit to non 0 values. \n\n`ppa` is similar (including repetition) but for 4 character (A-Za-z) words. Why 4 characters exactly, why fixed \"A-Za-z\", what is the actual logic behind the order?\n\nMost of my observations above are based on slightly outdated rizin version.\n\n\nThe way I look at most of the `pp` commands having them for printing those sequences are more or of swiss army knife style utilities. Occasionally they might be useful for something and it's nice to have a builtin command for generating them instead of having lookup some online tool or copy pasting snippet from stack overflow. But how you actually use the output of them is very situation specific.", "> Better description for current /p n would be \"search n byte patterns which show up in binary more than once\".\n\nThanks, fixed in the description.\n\n> ppd assuming it refers to de Brujin sequence and there aren't multiple things named after him, why would you want to search for it in an executable. In specific situations it's useful strategy for trying every combination in less steps by overlaping the values, but searching for the pattern itself in binary makes little sense to me. Searching if executable contains hard coded (in the target executable) de Brujin sequence, is no better than having a dedicated search command for Fibonacci sequence or nth digit of pi.\n\nNot whole patterns and not the executable. One of the valid scenarios - using Rizin to open memory dumps or coredumps, where *parts* of De Bruijn pattern could be located." ],

      "comments" : [ "Hi! Thanks for creating this issue!\r\n\r\nMy interpretation of that issue is that it is possible to use an `editor` in your own fork, but that `cz-cli` has decided to not do it. I have concerns with introducing an editor input instead of a one-line input.\r\n\r\nI agree with you that it's much easier to create nice commit messages in a much better format. I do however think there are some very large drawbacks. Firstly the default editor is vim, which scares a large portion of new developers. I think this library should be a helpful tool _especially_ for new developers. Secondly, I think it's a bit distracting to get redirected into some other interface (for all developers who have configured vs code as their default editor).\r\n\r\nIn my experience, most commit messages are short enough to be one line, and the few messages that I want to have longer, I write using GitKraken or in my favorite editor by just running `git commit`. I don't think we should optimize for the infrequent use case of having to write long commit messages when the majority of commit messages are short and where this change would hurt that majority of use cases.\r\n\r\nWith that said, I do agree that I would want to be able to write multiline commits with this tool as well (even though it's more of a nice to have). And it can also be seen as a motivator to write better and longer commit messages.\r\n\r\nI looked into creating my own inquirer prompt that would somehow allow multiline inputs but still stay in the same terminal context. We don't want to reinvent the wheel by creating a new fully-fledged editor but what we could do is allow you to write one line at a time. When you have written a line and press enter you get a new input. If you leave it empty we go to the next prompt but as long as you keep writing stuff you will get new inputs. This wouldn't allow you to go back and delete or change your commit message but maybe that's fine.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about all of this?", "I understand your concerns, and thanks for the detailed response. I did not realize that this is a feature not provided in `cz-cli` either. I do think that it is a great addition though, since I frequently write multi-line comments. I believe commits should be a kind of documentation, and having one-liner descriptions makes it harder.\r\n\r\nYour suggestion sounds like a nice compromise. I think that a hint of that behavior would help a lot, since an empty line acting as an end is not that intuitive.\r\n\r\nThere are some more suggestions that I would find more intuitive, although I am not sure if they are technically feasible. The discussion in `cz-cli` mentioned potentially parsing `\\n` or `\\r\\n` sequences. However, I find using `Shift + Enter` is a common shortcut in the web when entering new lines in fields that are submitted on `Enter`. If the terminal would allow such handling, I think it would be best.", "Yeah, actually that is a great suggestion! If you can detect `Shift + Enter` I think that is the best. It is easy to add a small hint saying `(press Shift + Enter for a new line)`. I think the easiest implementation is to create a custom prompt.\r\n\r\nThe greatest challenge is probably how to support going back to previous lines and delete stuff, but maybe you don't have to support that. ", "Indeed it might be out of this scope deleting previous lines, although I do think that it might be possible with some trickery. However, this is still just an extra \"nice to have\".", "we really need multilines commit, any news?" ],

      "description" : "### Is there an existing issue already for this feature request/idea?\n\n- [x] I have searched for an existing issue, and could not find anything. I believe this is a new feature request to be evaluated.\n\n### What problem is this feature going to solve? Why should it be added?\n\nRight now, the `Database` CRD only manages the `owner` of the schema.\n\nPostgreSQL provides two privileges as part of the `GRANT` command on schemas: `CREATE` and `GRANT`. See [\"SQL Grant\"](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-grant.html).\n\nUsers are now using the post initialization scripts for this, making it imperative, one-off and thus fragile.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nProviding usage permissions on managed schema objects as part of the `Database` CRD.\n\nThe `GRANT` SQL command in Postgres has the following syntax:\n\n```sql\nGRANT { { CREATE | USAGE } [, ...] | ALL [ PRIVILEGES ] }\n    ON SCHEMA schema_name [, ...]\n    TO role_specification [, ...] [ WITH GRANT OPTION ]\n    [ GRANTED BY role_specification ]\n```\n\nBoth `GRANTED BY` and `WITH GRANT OPTION` are not suitable for a declarative environment typical of CloudNativePG, so we will focus only on `CREATE` and `USAGE`.\n\nA possible implementation could be:\n\n```yaml\n# ...\nspec:\n  schemas:\n  - name: app\n    owner: app\n    create:\n    - name: angus\n      type: grant\n    - name: brian\n      type: revoke\n    usage:\n    - name: angus\n      type: grant\n    - name: brian\n      type: grant\n# ...\n```\n\nThe default `type` is `grant`.\n\nFor example, the above will check that `angus` hasn't got yet the `create` privilege for the `app` database and run the required `GRANT CREATE ON app TO angus`. Similarly, if `brian` has `create` usage on the same `app` schema, it will run `REVOKE CREATE ON app FROM angus`.\n\nSee: [`REVOKE`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-revoke.html).\n\nPlease feel free to change the above proposal if you have a better idea.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nWe could do nothing, and delegate this operation to another tool.\n\nHowever, I personally think that this is a good responsibility for the `schema` management feature in the `Database` CRD.\n\n### Additional context\n\nN/A\n\n### Backport?\n\nNo\n\n### Are you willing to actively contribute to this feature?\n\nYes\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct",

For example, when I'm writing a [query module for database export](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/100), I'm actually creating a `JSON` file with a list of nodes and relationships. Therefore, I have to reach every label, property, etc. of each `Vertex` and `Edge`. I would like to be able to just add properties as a list to my properties key, but then `mgp.Vertex.properties` is not `JSON` serializable. I solved this by going through all properties and creating new dictionary, but I think that the right place for this code would be inside mgp and not query module. Since we're going to create new utility modules similar to the export one, this feature may come in handy.\r\n\r\n",

      "description" : "### Title\n\n[Content] Insufficient text-to-background contrast\n\n### Description\n\nThe text color used in the following element has insufficient contrast with its background color. This results in very low readability, especially for users with low vision or color vision deficiencies. According to WCAG 2.2 Level AA, normal text must have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, and large text (over 18 pt or 14 pt bold) must meet 3:1. The detected text on the page does not satisfy these thresholds.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. go to /tutorials/setting-up-your-environment/\n2.  Locate to the following element:\n```\n<span style=\"color: rgb(215, 58, 73); opacity: 1; background-color: rgb(247, 247, 247);\"><img src=\"chrome-extension://jbbplnpkjmmeebjpijfedlgcdilocofh/img/icons/contrast.svg\" class=\"wave5icon\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" alt=\"CONTRAST ERRORS: Very low contrast\" style=\"border: none; vertical-align: middle; cursor: pointer; width: 44px; height: 44px; z-index: 1000; position: relative;\">function</span>\n```\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe word \"function\" is rendered in #D73A49 (a red tone) on a #F7F7F7 (light gray) background. This color combination produces a contrast ratio that is below 4.5:1, violating WCAG 2.1 Level AA contrast requirements for normal-sized text.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nText should maintain sufficient color contrast against its background to ensure readability. For normal-size text, the minimum ratio is 4.5:1; for large text (over 18pt or 14pt bold), 3:1. The color combination used should meet or exceed these thresholds.\n\n### Environments\n\n_No response_\n\n### Suggested Fix\n\nIncrease the contrast between the foreground (text) color and the background color.\n\n### Reference\n\nWCAG:\n* [Success Criterion 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#contrast-minimum)\n\nWCAG-T:\n* [G18: Ensuring that a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 exists between text (and images of text) and background behind the text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/general/G18)\n* [G145: Ensuring that a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 exists between text (and images of text) and background behind the text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/general/G145)\n\n### What is your operating system?\n\nNone\n\n### Web browser and version\n\n_No response_",

While the existing `lookup` command performs comprehensive object retrieval including WebFinger, there are many cases where users only want to test WebFinger configuration. This command takes a `@user@domain` handle as an argument and outputs only the WebFinger result (JRD) in JSON format.\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n- Create a new `webfinger.ts` file in the CLI directory, using `lookup.ts` as a reference\n- Utilize the existing `lookupWebFinger()` function from the Fedify library\n- Add the new command to `mod.ts` to register it with the CLI\n- Output results in clean JSON format for easy parsing\n- Handle WebFinger-specific errors appropriately\n\n## Why This Is a Good First Issue\n\n- **Independent feature**: Add new functionality without modifying existing code\n- **Learn structure**: Experience the complete process of adding a new CLI command\n- **Code reuse**: Great example of leveraging existing Fedify library functions\n- **Focused scope**: Single-purpose command with clear input/output expectations\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Create `fedify webfinger <handle>` command\n- [ ] Accept `@user@domain` format handles as input\n- [ ] Output WebFinger JRD results in JSON format\n- [ ] Handle invalid handles and WebFinger lookup failures gracefully\n- [ ] Register the command in the CLI module system\n- [ ] Add appropriate help text and usage examples\n\n## Files to Create/Modify\n\n- `cli/webfinger.ts` - New command implementation\n- `cli/mod.ts` - Register the new command\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```bash\nfedify webfinger @user@example.com\nfedify webfinger @mastodon@mastodon.social\n```",

According to [Flyte 1.9 release notes](https://flyte.org/blog/flyte-1-9-arraynode-execution-tags-new-navigation-and-more/), Flyte introduced ArrayNode map tasks, which are an evolution of the existing map tasks, providing more robust support for subtask executions. However, the current `current_context` does not include an index for array nodes.\n\n### Proposed Solution:\n1. **Motivation**: Adding an index to the `current_context` would help uniquely identify each array node's output, preventing overwrites and aiding in debugging.\n2. **Goal**: Modify the `current_context` to include a `node_index` field representing the map_task index.\n3. **Alternatives**: Generating random IDs for each instance, although this is less efficient and harder to trace.\n\nWould you like more details on how to proceed with this proposal or how to implement a workaround?\n\n### Example Code Block:\n```python\nfrom flytekit import current_context\n\n@task\ndef my_task():\n    ctx = current_context()\n    node_index = ctx.execution_id.node_id  # Hypothetical field addition\n    print(f\"Node Index: {node_index}\")\n```\n\nSources:\n- [Flyte 1.9 release notes](https://flyte.org/blog/flyte-1-9-arraynode-execution-tags-new-navigation-and-more/)\n\n---\nThis is an AI-generated response and your feedback is appreciated!

And adding virtual columns complicates things.\n\nWhen there are no virtual columns, there's no difference between \"table rows stored on disk\" and \"table rows seen by the engine\". But once a table has virtual columns, that distinction matters, and any code that assumes that the two are identical may get incorrect results.\n\nIn this case, it's likely that the `dolt diff` code is reading the rows directly out of storage and assuming that they match the table schema. Due to the way we store rows, adding a `NULL` to the end of a row doesn't change the bytes on disk: so for example, the row `(1, NULL)` and the row `(1,)` have the exact same bytes. So `dolt diff` is likely reading the latter and treating it like it's the former.\n\nI think that the best solution here is to simply omit any virtual generated columns from the output, since computing the correct value for the column would be more complicated and potentially slow.\n\nThe code for the diff command is in `go/cmd/dolt/commands/diff.go`. Most of the logic for the command works by writing SQL queries against [system tables](https://docs.dolthub.com/sql-reference/version-control/dolt-system-tables). Most likely this will involve changing the behavior of the `dolt_diff()` system table function to not have columns for virtual generated columns. That table function is defined in `go/libraries/doltcore/sqle/dtablefunctions/dolt_diff_table_function.go`.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions! There's a lot going on in these files because they interact with the SQL engine, but stepping through a sample `dolt diff` command in the debugger should help you figure out what each part is doing.", "Is anyone still working on this?

So, perhaps, ```ramalama run --runtime whisper.cpp ggml-large-v3-turbo.bin``` gets you a bash prompt with a motd saying ```type 'transcribe /audio/jfk.wav' to blah blah blah etc```?

Command-line invocation over a bound directory seems adequate and possibly ideal.  It probably doesn't require any code overlap with whisper.cpp, using Ramalama as scaffolding to bring all the pieces together and offering a layer of abstraction wrt GPU config, system libraries, etc.  But I'm not deep into any of these techs or projects, so if there's a better vision / direction I'd love to hear about it.", "The stdout stuff should just work, we could even just have whisper grab /dev/stdin when it sees the \"-\". \n\nThe volume mount can also be marked ro,z so it is both readonly and available for reading based on SELinux.", "    podman run --rm -i --device nvidia.com/gpu=all \\\n    --mount=type=image,src=WHISPER.CPP-MODEL-SHORTNAME,destination=/mnt/models,rw=false,subpath=/models \\\n    --mount=type=bind,src=/[FQual-dir-of-user-inputfilewav]/,destination=/mnt/audio/USERFILE.wav,rw=false,z \\\n    ramalama-image /bin/sh -c \"whisper-main -m /mnt/models/model.file -f /mnt/audio/USERFILE.wav\"", "Slightly simpler.\n\npodman run --rm -i --device nvidia.com/gpu=all \\\n--mount=type=image,src=WHISPER.CPP-MODEL-SHORTNAME,destination=/mnt/models,rw=false,subpath=/models \\\n-v/[FQual-dir-of-user-inputfilewav]/:/mnt/audio/USERFILE.wav:ro,z \\\nramalama-image /bin/sh -c \"whisper-main -m /mnt/models/model.file -f /mnt/audio/USERFILE.wav\"\n\n", "Looks like `whisper -f -` is supported now, although the entire file needs to be flushed through the pipe I believe.\n", "> Looks like whisper -f - is supported\n\nIt does look that way, though I haven't prepared any large wav files to test with.

Especially if it creates the possibility of chaining ffmpeg without intermediate conversion files.\n\nSo, consensus seems to be that ```cat jfk.wav | ramalama --runtime whisper.cpp run ggml-tiny.bin``` should produce and run something vaguely like ```podman run --rm -i --device nvidia.com/gpu=all --mount=type=bind,src=models/,destination=/mnt/models,rw=false ramalama /bin/sh -c \"whisper-main -m /mnt/models/ggml-tiny.bin -f -\"```  That doesn't seem too difficult at first blush.  I'll see what I can do in the coming days.\n\nThanks", "stdin seems fine to me. Also we can autodetect when there is stdin coming in, it's better for usability, you don't need the explicit '-' then, although we can have the ability to explicitly use stdin also '-', grep is an example of a command that does this and llama-run. Once llama-run is integrated into RamaLama, I plan on adding this to the ramalama run:\n\n`git diff | ramalama run granite-code \"Write a git commit message for this change\"`\n\nllm-gguf and ollama have this feature.\n", "Cool", "We now have images with whisper-server as an entrypoint.  Should be able to run one of these images directly and redirect the WAVE file to it.\n\n", "@ericcurtin not sure what the work needs to be done for this one?", "@ericcurtin What should we do with this one now?\n", "Hi all, just wanted to add a quick follow-up to this thread since I participated in the discussion.\n\nAt the time, my primary use case was generating subtitle files (e.g., SRT) for a side project. After our discussion, it became clear that the most direct path for Ramalama was to support piping `whisper.cpp`'s standard output, while my need was more centered around its file-based output features (like `-osrt`).\n\nSince my project priorities were tied to that specific workflow, I ended up moving in a different direction and didn't have the bandwidth to circle back to implement the `stdin`/`stdout` plan we discussed. Apologies for not closing the loop sooner.\n\nIt's great to see the issue is still active and that you're still actively improving Ramalama.  It's a great and undervalued tool.\n\n-FNG" ],

      "description" : "\nCurrently, the method `check_public_repo()` calls the GitHub API every time it is invoked. This results in redundant requests that can be optimized through caching. Implementing caching will improve performance and reduce the number of calls made to the GitHub API.\n\n**Proposed Changes:**\n\n1. **Implement Caching**:\n   - Introduce a caching mechanism to store the visibility status of repositories after the first API call.\n   - Use an in-memory caching solution like `cachetools` or utilize built-in Python caching decorators to manage the cache.\n   - Ensure that the cache is valid for a reasonable time period or until the repository status changes.\n\n2. **Modify `check_public_repo` Method**:\n   - Refactor the existing `check_public_repo` method to first check the cache for the repository status before making the API call.\n   - Update logic to cache the results from GitHub API calls.\n\n3. **Testing**:\n   - Write unit tests to verify that the caching mechanism works as intended and that subsequent calls to `check_public_repo()` use the cached data instead of hitting the GitHub API.\n\n4. **Documentation**:\n   - Update any relevant documentation to reflect these changes and ensure that the caching logic is well-understood for future developers.\n\n**Impacted Files**:\n- `app/modules/code_provider/github/github_service.py`: This is the primary file where the `check_public_repo` method is defined and updated.\n\n**Next Steps**: If approved, I will begin implementing the caching mechanism and refactoring the `check_public_repo` method. Following that, a pull request will be submitted for code review.",

      "description" : "## Motivation\n\nThe [ICORE (International CORE Conference Rankings)](https://www.core.edu.au/home) is a ranking of computer science conferences (A*, A, B, C). In JabRef, we want to add a new field that stores the ICORE ranking of a given conference. Users often want to know how highly ranked a paper's venue is. You can search conferences manually via the [ICORE website](https://portal.core.edu.au/conf-ranks/), but this should be automated.\n\nExample search result\n\n<img width=\"1280\" height=\"246\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2f0efc5-f6ef-48b8-8e81-929e54cb9b3d\" />\n\n## \uD83D\uDCCC Goal\n\nWhen a BibTeX entry includes a conference title like:\n\n`ACIS Conference on Software Engineering Research, Management and Applications (SERA)`\n\nThe tool should:\n\n- Extract the acronym in parentheses ??? SERA.\n- Search the ICORE rankings for this acronym.\n- If a match is found (e.g. SERA has rank C), populate the new icoreranking field with that value.\n- If no exact match is found, fall back to fuzzy matching using similarity scoring (> 0.9).\n\n## \uD83D\uDEE0??? Tasks\n\n- [ ] Move DuplicateCheck#similarity from org.jabref.logic.database to a new utility class: org.jabref.logic.util.strings.StringSimilarity.\n- [ ] Add ICORE.csv to src/main/resources/\n- [ ] Create a class that loads and indexes the ICORE data at instantiation.\n- [ ] Implement the logic to detect and return the ranking from a full conference name.\n- [ ] Create a new field: ICORANKING ('icoranking') and add it to org.jabref.model.entry.field.StandardField at the // JabRef-specific fields section.\n- [ ] Create a new field editor ICoreRankingEditor (inspired by IdentifierEditor) and integrate it into the UI by modifying FieldEditors#getForField(...). - Tghe lookup button (like DOI lookup) to lookup the ranking in the `CSV` file\n- [ ] Write unit tests for acronym matching and similarity fallback.\n\nTest end-to-end behavior via TDD.\n\n##  \uD83D\uDCDA Helpful resources\n\n[How to contribute to JabRef](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing)\n\n[JabRef Developer Documentation](https://devdocs.jabref.org/)\n\nICORE Rankings CSV: https://portal.core.edu.au/conf-ranks/ ???

Currently I've to write hybrid unit tests by using PowerMockito along with mockK library to use the [suppress functionality](https://github.com/powermock/powermock/wiki/Suppress-Unwanted-Behavior) provided by PowerMockito, due to lack of such cool feature or function in mockK.\r\n\r\n#### `WhiteBox`\r\n[WhiteBox](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.powermock/powermock-reflect/1.6.4/org/powermock/reflect/Whitebox.html) is another useful one from PowerMockito which is missing in mockK and would really be helpful if available on this library.\r\n\r\nCurrent Specs:\r\n* MockK version: V1.12.3 \r\n* OS: Mac OS\r\n* Kotlin version: 1.6.0\r\n",

      "description" : "\nFollowing OSMU townhall #29 discussion \n\nIt would be very useful to have the ability to enable/ disable the onboard TPS that feeds the asic. \n\nthis would allow for mining to be commanded by an external source to start/ stop mining whilst keeping the ESP and AxeOs alive , so the user can maintain connectivity, stats, swarm etc. \n\na use case scenario is the upcoming solarbit $0/khw project. Currently i will cut the entire power to the bitaxe but would be better to just instruct the bitaxe via the BAP port to stop mining when sun is down.. and start mining when sun is up. a cleaner way that killing the entire miner. \n\nSummary: \n\n1) API command to start stop TPS \n2) BAP port ability to accept such commands from external esp32 hardwired via 6pin BAP \n3) Not sure if possible: but if no mining is being conducted .. we dont need active cooling on the asic.. therefore is it possible when TPS is commanded to stop power to asic to also terminate power to the fan ? worst case pwm to minimum ? thinking how we could maximize energy efficiency by only running essentials on bitaxe to maintain heartbeat. fan running for no reason ruins the efficiency and limit wasted power.
