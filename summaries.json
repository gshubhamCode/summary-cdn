Maybe we could try other approaches like:\n\n1)Using passive measurements from traffic timestamps, like how long the TCP handshake takes, if that info is available\n2)Sending ICMP or TCP timestamp requests only when needed or just for some selected connections\n3)Caching latency values and updating them every now and then to keep overhead low\n", "Labeling this issue as https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/labels/good%20first%20issue and https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/labels/help%20wanted to gather additional feedback and help ", "I think the best approach would be to only ping the selected connections, as pinging other connections would only add to the network load and be of no value.

      "repositoryName" : "WordPress/gutenberg",
      "description" : "## What problem does this address?\n<!--\nPlease describe if this feature or enhancement is related to a current problem\nor pain point. For example, \"I'm always frustrated when ...\" or \"It is currently\ndifficult to ...\".\n-->\nMost of Block Editor components don't have stories.\nBlock Editor components's Storybook should also be added and updated like the Components.\nrelated #22891\n\n## What is your proposed solution?\n<!--\nPlease outline the feature or enhancement that you want and how it addresses any\nproblem identified above.\n-->\nWe can use this issue to track the addition and updating of the stories for Block Editor.\nYou can add the link to assign yourself to each component.\nAs I know, Block Editor Components list has never existed, so at first, we can start to be based on the directory name.\nThe list was made automatically, and we can ignore the component for native only.\n\nIf you cannot edit the list, please comment on which you made the PR for which directory's components.\n\ncc @WordPress/gutenberg-components \n\n## Best Practices\n\n### 1. Use CSF 3 format\n\nWrite stories as objects, not functions\n\n<details><summary>Do</summary>\n\n```jsx\nexport const Default = {\n\trender: function Template( { onChange, ...args } ) {\n\t\tconst [ value, setValue ] = useState();\n\t\treturn (\n\t\t\t<SomeComponent\n\t\t\t\t{ ...args }\n\t\t\t\tonChange={ ( ...changeArgs ) => {\n\t\t\t\t\tonChange( ...changeArgs );\n\t\t\t\t\tsetValue( ...changeArgs );\n\t\t\t\t} }\n\t\t\t\tvalue={ value }\n\t\t\t/>\n\t\t);\n\t},\n};\n```\n\n</details> \n\n<details><summary>Don't</summary>\n\n```jsx\nconst Template = ( { onChange, ...args } ) => {\n\tconst [ value, setValue ] = useState();\n\treturn (\n\t\t<SomeComponent\n\t\t\t{ ...args }\n\t\t\tonChange={ ( ...changeArgs ) => {\n\t\t\t\tonChange( ...changeArgs );\n\t\t\t\tsetValue( ...changeArgs );\n\t\t\t} }\n\t\t\tvalue={ value }\n\t\t/>\n\t);\n};\n\nexport const Default = Template.bind( {} );\n```\n\n</details> \n\n### 2. Consists of only one component\n \nThe purpose of Storybook is to test a single UI component itself. Therefore, unless there is a special reason, we should not include anything other than that component.\n\n### 3. Don???t create too many stories\n\nWhile it's tempting to expose as many variations of a component as possible, the behavior of the component can be changed in the Controls section.\n\nTherefore, additional stories should only be included if they involve significant visual or behavioral changes.\n\n### 4. About meta data\n\nTo display the source panel by default, specify `'shown'` in [the `meta.parameters.docs.canvas.sourceState` field](https://storybook.js.org/docs/api/doc-blocks/doc-block-canvas#sourcestate).\n\n<details><summary>Example</summary>\n\n```javascript\nconst meta = {\n\t// ...\n\tparameters: {\n\t\tdocs: {\n\t\t\tcanvas: { sourceState: 'shown' },\n\t\t\t// ...\n\t\t},\n\t},\n\t// ...\n};\n```\n\n</details> \n\nDefine the component description via the `meta.parameters.docs.description.component` field instead of a comment.\n\n<details><summary>Example</summary>\n\n```javascript\nconst meta = {\n\t// ...\n\tparameters: {\n\t\tdocs: {\n\t\t\t// ...\n\t\t\tdescription: {\n\t\t\t\tcomponent: 'Component description here...',\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t},\n\t},\n\t// ...\n};\n```\n\n</details> \n\nExplicitly define the type of props via the `meta.argTypes.{propName}.table.type.summary` field.\n\n<details><summary>Example</summary>\n\n```javascript\nconst meta = {\n\t// ...\n\targTypes: {\n\t\t// ...\n\t\tpropName: {\n\t\t\t// ...\n\t\t\ttable: {\n\t\t\t\ttype: {\n\t\t\t\t\tsummary: 'string',\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t},\n\t\t// ...\n\t},\n};\n```\n\n</details> \n\n\nFor private components, you may want to define the following fields to display the badge \uD83D\uDD12 ([Private APIs README](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/blob/trunk/packages/private-apis/README.md)).\n\nCheck [here](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/blob/f1fadbb036f1e702e3a28072444fd0de28a5dc02/packages/block-editor/src/private-apis.js#L57-L100) to see if the component is exported as private.\n\n<details><summary>Example</summary>\n\n```javascript\nconst meta = {\n\t// ...\n\ttags: [ 'status-private' ],\n\t// ...\n};\n```\n\n</details> \n\n### 5. Others\n\nIf the component you're working on doesn't have a README or JDoc, I'd appreciate it if you could do the following to clarify the component's implementation first:\n\n- If there's no README file: This is part of https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/22891. If the component already has JSDoc, you can use it to help write the README.\n- If there's no README and no JSDoc: You'll need to analyze the component's implementation and clarify the types of props and return types. See https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/22891#issuecomment-2543030487 for information on the JSDoc format.\n\n## Block Editor Components directories List\n\n\n<details><summary>Components List</summary>\n\nNote: \uD83D\uDD12 indicates that the component is private.\n\n\n\n- [x] alignment-control #67046\n  - `AlignmentControl`\n  -  `AlignmentToolbar`\n- [x] ~audio-player (for native only)~\n- [ ] autocomplete (`BlockEditorAutocomplete` based on `Autocomplete` from `@wordpress/components`.

I'm not saying we shouldn't be doing this but curious to lean what value you folks will be receiving from this ?\n\ncc @WordPress/gutenberg-core for awareness.", "I see a couple benefits from the maintainer side:\n\n- Improve engineering quality. Working in the isolated story when iterating on the component (as opposed to working directly in the Gutenberg app) promotes better engineering standards because it forces you to think about encapsulation, clear interfaces, etc.\n- Increase iteration speed. Having a story is much faster for discovery and testing different states. You don't have to dig around the app to see where the component is used, figure out what states exist, and how to reproduce them.\n\nI honestly don't know if there is pure documentation value for the extenders.\n\nI'd like to emphasize that we should write the stories in a way that **keeps maintenance cost at a minimum**. It will quickly become a net-negative if the stories incur a maintenance cost. For example, avoid hardcoded values as much as possible, and try to structure things in a way that will not need fixing when the underlying component code changes. Don't write unnecessary descriptions, as those are another thing that need to be updated manually when things change. Let's start with the simplest possible.", "As a plugin developer, I find Storybook extremely useful.\n\nWhen implementing a UI for a custom block or block editor, I can see what components are exposed, what props are supported, and how they work.\n\nWithout Storybook, it's hard to imagine how something would work unless I actually wrote the code while reading the documentation, or found a place in the Gutenberg repository where the component is actually used.", "I have looked at the PR linked to this issue and I think we need some kind of indicator to unify our implementations and approaches for contributors who are already working on this issue or are planning to work on it.\n\nBelow are my thoughts on best practices, but @WordPress/gutenberg-components, if there are any mistakes, please let me know.\n\n### Use CSF 3 format\n\nWrite stories as objects, not functions\n\n#### Do\n\n```jsx\nexport const Default = {\n\trender: function Template( { onChange, ...args } ) {\n\t\tconst [ value, setValue ] = useState();\n\t\treturn (\n\t\t\t<SomeComponent\n\t\t\t\t{ ...args }\n\t\t\t\tonChange={ ( ...changeArgs ) => {\n\t\t\t\t\tonChange( ...changeArgs );\n\t\t\t\t\tsetValue( ...changeArgs );\n\t\t\t\t} }\n\t\t\t\tvalue={ value }\n\t\t\t/>\n\t\t);\n\t},\n};\n```\n\n#### Don't\n\n```jsx\nconst Template = ( { onChange, ...args } ) => {\n\tconst [ value, setValue ] = useState();\n\treturn (\n\t\t<SomeComponent\n\t\t\t{ ...args }\n\t\t\tonChange={ ( ...changeArgs ) => {\n\t\t\t\tonChange( ...changeArgs );\n\t\t\t\tsetValue( ...changeArgs );\n\t\t\t} }\n\t\t\tvalue={ value }\n\t\t/>\n\t);\n};\n\nexport const Default = Template.bind( {} );\n```\n\n### Consists of only one component\n\nI think the purpose of Storybook is to test a single UI component itself. Therefore, unless there is a special reason, we should not include anything other than that component.\n\n### Don???t create too many stories\n\nWhile it's tempting to expose as many variations of a component as possible, the behavior of the component can be changed in the Controls section.\n\nTherefore, I think additional stories should only be included if they involve significant visual or behavioral changes.", "Additional Tips - To improve code consistency, I would personally be happy to implement the following rules for existing and future PRs:\n\nTo display the source panel by default, specify `'shown'` in [the `meta.parameters.docs.canvas.sourceState` field](https://storybook.js.org/docs/api/doc-blocks/doc-block-canvas#sourcestate).\n\n```javascript\nconst meta = {\n\t// ...\n\tparameters: {\n\t\tdocs: {\n\t\t\tcanvas: { sourceState: 'shown' },\n\t\t\t// ...\n\t\t},\n\t},\n\t// ...\n};\n```\n\nDefine the component description via the `meta.parameters.docs.description.component` field instead of a comment.\n\n```javascript\nconst meta = {\n\t// ...\n\tparameters: {\n\t\tdocs: {\n\t\t\t// ...\n\t\t\tdescription: {\n\t\t\t\tcomponent: 'Component description here...',\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t},\n\t},\n\t// ...\n};\n```\n\nExplicitly define the type of props via the `meta.argTypes.{propName}.table.type.summary` field.\n\n```javascript\nconst meta = {\n\t// ...\n\targTypes: {\n\t\t// ...\n\t\tpropName: {\n\t\t\t// ...\n\t\t\ttable: {\n\t\t\t\ttype: {\n\t\t\t\t\tsummary: 'string',\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t},\n\t\t// ...\n\t},\n};\n```", "I noticed that some components have the `__experimental` or `__unstable` prefix.\n\nI wondered if I should publish these components to Storybook, but some components with these prefix have already been published.\n\nIf the component has a proper README and code examples, I believe it's okay to publish it to Storybook.", "Thanks to everyone working on this issue. Although not directly related to this issue, I noticed that some components don't have a README or JSDoc.\n\nIf the component you're working on doesn't have a README or JDoc, I'd appreciate it if you could do the following to clarify the component's implementation first:\n\n- If there's no README file: This is part of #22891. If the component already has JSDoc, you can use it to help write the README.\n- If there's no README and no JSDoc: You'll need to analyze the component's implementation and clarify the types of props and return types.

For internal components, it is marked as `(Internal) component`.\n\nWe need to consider whether to expose internal components to Storybook.\n\nIf we do, it may be useful for Gutenberg contributors, but it will not be useful for the extenders.\n\nPersonally, I don't think internal components need to be exposed.

Sorry, I should have noticed this sooner.\n\nI look forward to your comments.", "Unlike private components, I think there is no intention of publicizing internal ones, so exposing them doesn't make sense.", "Okay, so let's not add Storybook to the internal components.

      "comments" : [ "# :wave: Important: PLEASE READ :wave:\n\nThis issue has been labeled as a **good first issue** and is available for anyone to work on.\n\nIf this is your first time contributing to an open source project, some aspects of the development process may seem unusual, arcane, or some combination of both.\n\n1.  **You cannot \"claim\" issues.** People new to open source often want to \"claim\" or be assigned an issue before beginning work. The typical rationale is that people want to avoid wasted work in the event that someone else ends up working the issue. However, this practice is not effective in open source, as it often leads to \"issue squatting\", in which an individual asks to be assigned, is granted their request, and then never ends up working on the issue. Accordingly, you are encouraged to communicate your intent to address this issue, ideally by providing a rough outline as to how you plan to address the issue or asking clarifying questions, but, at the end of the day, we will take running code and rough consensus in order to move forward quickly.\n2.  **We have a very high bar for contributions.** We have very high standards for contributions and expect all contributions???whether new features, tests, or documentation???to be rigorous, thorough, and complete. Once a pull request is merged into stdlib, that contribution immediately becomes the collective responsibility of all maintainers of stdlib. When we merge code into stdlib, we are saying that we, the maintainers, commit to reviewing subsequent changes and making bugfixes to the code. Hence, in order to ensure future maintainability, this naturally leads to a higher standard of contribution.\n\nBefore working on this issue and opening a pull request, please read the project's [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md). These guidelines and the associated [development guide](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/docs/contributing/development.md) provide important information, including links to stdlib's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), license policy, and steps for setting up your local development environment.\n\nTo reiterate, we **strongly** encourage you to refer to our contributing guides **before** beginning work on this issue. Failure to follow our guidelines significantly decreases the likelihood that you'll successfully contribute to stdlib and may result in automatic closure of a pull request without review.\n\nSetting up your local development environment is a critical first step, as doing so ensures that automated development processes for linting, license verification, and unit testing can run prior to authoring commits and pushing changes. If you would prefer to avoid manual setup, we provide pre-configured [development containers](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/tree/develop/.devcontainer) for use locally or in GitHub Codespaces.\n\nWe place a high value on consistency throughout the stdlib codebase. We encourage you to closely examine other packages in stdlib and attempt to emulate the practices and conventions found therein.\n\n-   If you are attempting to contribute a new package, sometimes the best approach is to simply copy the contents of an existing package and then modify the minimum amount necessary to implement the feature (e.g., changing descriptions, parameter names, and implementation).\n-   If you are contributing tests, find a package implementing a similar feature and emulate the tests of that package.\n-   If you are updating documentation, examine several similar packages and emulate the content, style, and prose of those packages.\n\nIn short, the more effort you put in to ensure that your contribution looks and feels like stdlib???including variables names, bracket spacing, line breaks, etc???the more likely that your contribution will be reviewed and ultimately accepted. We encourage you to closely study the codebase **before** beginning work on this issue.\n\n:sparkles: Thank you again for your interest in stdlib, and we look forward to reviewing your future contributions. :sparkles:\n" ],

      "comments" : [ "# :wave: Important: PLEASE READ :wave:\n\nThis issue has been labeled as a **good first issue** and is available for anyone to work on.\n\nIf this is your first time contributing to an open source project, some aspects of the development process may seem unusual, arcane, or some combination of both.\n\n1.  **You cannot \"claim\" issues.** People new to open source often want to \"claim\" or be assigned an issue before beginning work. The typical rationale is that people want to avoid wasted work in the event that someone else ends up working the issue. However, this practice is not effective in open source, as it often leads to \"issue squatting\", in which an individual asks to be assigned, is granted their request, and then never ends up working on the issue. Accordingly, you are encouraged to communicate your intent to address this issue, ideally by providing a rough outline as to how you plan to address the issue or asking clarifying questions, but, at the end of the day, we will take running code and rough consensus in order to move forward quickly.\n2.  **We have a very high bar for contributions.** We have very high standards for contributions and expect all contributions???whether new features, tests, or documentation???to be rigorous, thorough, and complete. Once a pull request is merged into stdlib, that contribution immediately becomes the collective responsibility of all maintainers of stdlib. When we merge code into stdlib, we are saying that we, the maintainers, commit to reviewing subsequent changes and making bugfixes to the code. Hence, in order to ensure future maintainability, this naturally leads to a higher standard of contribution.\n\nBefore working on this issue and opening a pull request, please read the project's [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md). These guidelines and the associated [development guide](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/docs/contributing/development.md) provide important information, including links to stdlib's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), license policy, and steps for setting up your local development environment.\n\nTo reiterate, we **strongly** encourage you to refer to our contributing guides **before** beginning work on this issue. Failure to follow our guidelines significantly decreases the likelihood that you'll successfully contribute to stdlib and may result in automatic closure of a pull request without review.\n\nSetting up your local development environment is a critical first step, as doing so ensures that automated development processes for linting, license verification, and unit testing can run prior to authoring commits and pushing changes. If you would prefer to avoid manual setup, we provide pre-configured [development containers](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/tree/develop/.devcontainer) for use locally or in GitHub Codespaces.\n\nWe place a high value on consistency throughout the stdlib codebase. We encourage you to closely examine other packages in stdlib and attempt to emulate the practices and conventions found therein.\n\n-   If you are attempting to contribute a new package, sometimes the best approach is to simply copy the contents of an existing package and then modify the minimum amount necessary to implement the feature (e.g., changing descriptions, parameter names, and implementation).\n-   If you are contributing tests, find a package implementing a similar feature and emulate the tests of that package.\n-   If you are updating documentation, examine several similar packages and emulate the content, style, and prose of those packages.\n\nIn short, the more effort you put in to ensure that your contribution looks and feels like stdlib???including variables names, bracket spacing, line breaks, etc???the more likely that your contribution will be reviewed and ultimately accepted. We encourage you to closely study the codebase **before** beginning work on this issue.\n\n:sparkles: Thank you again for your interest in stdlib, and we look forward to reviewing your future contributions. :sparkles:\n" ],

Should these ports be included in OSGC?", "they can be added, however I had two concerns\n- if there's already another site that is serving a purpose well (e.g. doom engines), it's not important to add to OSGC since we will just be duplicating work\n- one of the goals of OSGC is to help players enjoy old games on modern platforms, so while playing doom on an airfryer is interesting, it is also not useful for most OSGC users\n\nso while there are no rules against adding such games, I would want to exercise some judgement before adding anything that doesn't technically break the rules" ],

", "Thank you for contributing :)", "@EzicStar I'm rather new to CS (in the middle of a slow career change) and this is the first time I've worked in this large of a codebase. I thought perhaps asking a few questions now would use less of your time than submitting a bad PR. I know you could probably tackle this issue quite quickly, so thank you for the opportunity to learn while working on it.\n\nI have a few ideas of where the right place to raise the error might be, if I understood the issue correctly. I've implemented Option 1 (see below), but I need a good way to test it. Would you like me to add a test to test_models.py or create a new test file? I'll probably work on creating a test while I wait to hear back.\n\n### Option 1\nRaise the error in `slide_to_patient_from_slide_table_`  within the file `src/stamp/modeling/data.py`. Specifically after line 476 before the line that starts with `slide_to_patient` we can check if within the filename_label column there is a string with a .h5 at the end. If not, we raise a value error. I think this would raise the error early enough to avoid unneeded work. The other two options that I see have the program do more work before checking for the .h5 extension.\n\n### Option 2\nAt the end of that same function (`slide_to_patient_from_slide_table_`), we could check the slide_to_patient's feature path. But why go through the trouble of mapping first?\n\n### Option 3\nIn crossval.py, deply.py, and train.py (all within src/stamp/modeling) after creating the `slide_to_patient` the code could check the FeaturePath for .h5 extensions. At the moment I think this is the worst option not only because of the duplication of code, but because more computation will occur before the lack of a .h5 extension is discovered. \n\nIf I missed an option or misinterpreted the error please let me know.\n\nThanks!", "Hi @WCDThor , \nOption 1 sounds great. Regarding tests, I think the best is to create one inside `test_data.py` simulating a slide table that raises this ValueError. You can maybe use one of the helper functions from random_data or see how are slide tables created in other tests. Thank you again for contributing and feel free to ask any questions. ", "Okay, thank you @EzicStar, that makes more sense to use test_data.py. I'd already confirmed my added code didn't break any of the tests in test_data.py and test_model.py. I will start work on adding a test or two soon, probably tomorrow afternoon (US PDT). I'll let you know if I have further questions. Thanks again. " ],

      "description" : "### Proposal\r\n\r\nWe are using GitOps to write, validate and deploy Prometheus rules.\r\n\r\nCurrently, `promtool check config/rules` only writes to standard output and reports failure with return code.\r\nThis is enough for deployment gating  depending on the success/failure of the checks.\r\n\r\nConcerning check of rules, only the code review can catch the case of a rule added without relevant test.\r\nBeing humans in a busy world, we can \"miss\" a rule and deploy the configuration without relevant test.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to have an output, understandable by a script, preferably using a well known format which would:\r\n\r\n- report individual test success/error (that's for the nice display in Jenkins by example)\r\n- report coverage of rules in a file (much harder)\r\n\r\nI recognize that the coverage request is opening a (small) can of worm  but it is the most interesting one IMHO.\r\n\r\nNote: I think a minimal xunit/junit format would be a good option since it is widely supported\r\n\r\nExample: \r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\r\n<testsuites>\r\n    <!-- test suite could correspond to test_group  -->\r\n    <testsuite timestamp=\"2023-01-13T10:05:06\">\r\n         <!-- test_group name for \"className\"  -->\r\n         <!-- for name of case, nothing exists ; index in suite may be enough - for alert_test_case, alertame coube part of it. -->\r\n        <testcase name=\"???\" classname=\"test_group.name\" time=\"0.001\">\r\n            <failure message=\"FAILED alertname:...\" type=\"result.DoesntMatch\">\r\n                <!-- message -->\r\n                exp:\"[....]\"\r\n                got:\"[...]\"\r\n            </failure>\r\n        </testcase>\r\n    </testsuite>\r\n</testsuites>\r\n```\r\n\r\nCoverage would be more tricky. For my use case, I would settle for a flag generating errors is a rule hasn't been tested in a run (could be an informational entry in output).\r\n",

The older version (result 0.15.1) is quite a bit better than the newer (since I can round to three decimal places to get the expected results or read from a filehandle instead of using `from_csv()` or `read_csv()`). The newer version (0.18.0) loses information, which is not acceptable.\n\nNote that the documentation at http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.18.1/generated/pandas.DataFrame.from_csv.html reads\n\n> It is preferable to use the more powerful `pandas.read_csv()` for most general purposes, but `from_csv` makes for an easy roundtrip to and from a file (the exact counterpart of `to_csv`), especially with a DataFrame of time series data.\n\nBut this does not describe what actually happens, as demonstrated above.\n",

Happy to build on the test cases already explored and draft a docs update if that would be helpful!\n", "@gumus-g , I do have some notes (containing links to relevant sources) that I compiled on this a while back. I wanted to determine under what circumstances it is reasonable to expect round-trip conversion from CSV (i.e., decimal) to binary floating-point and back. Basically, there are specific conditions (i.e., inequalities) relating the precisions in decimal and binary that specify when you can reasonably expect a round-trip conversion to work exactly.\n\nUnfortunately, I'm travelling and will not have access to the old laptop with those notes on them until I return home (~Aug. 1). If you do take this issue from @hualiu01 , I will share my notes with you as soon as I have them.", "Thanks, @dhavide ??? I???d definitely be interested in reviewing those notes once you???re back. The conditions around round-trip fidelity between decimal and binary representations sound like exactly the kind of nuance that would strengthen the docs. I???ll hold off on any final edits until I???ve had a chance to incorporate your sources.\nIn the meantime, I???ll continue exploring the current behavior and edge cases, and will keep this thread updated if I draft anything preliminary.\nSafe travels, and looking forward to syncing up after Aug. 1!\n" ],

This wrapper has been previously made for and functioned with p5. The details of the wrapper needn't matter too much, the point is that it requires the use of instance mode.\n\nCurrent functional minimal functional code using instance mode works is as follows. The `setup` and `draw` functions are supplied to the wrapper, `q` is used as a frontend for q5 (as is [officially documented](https://github.com/q5js/q5.js/wiki/Instance-Mode)).\n```ts\nlet q: Q5 = new Q5(\"instance\");\nq.setup = () => {\n    setup(q);\n};\n\n  q.draw = () => {\n    draw(q);\n};\n```\n\nThis code works and runs without errors. The problem is that the in-editor type validation does not work, as the `Q5` type does not actually contain most of q5's functions. Those functions are only declared in types under a global scope. I tried various workarounds to import the global scope of types into a custom named type, but nothing I tried worked for that.\n\nWould it be possible to have a type that includes all the functions and constants of Q5, instead of only having them in the global scope? Or is it somehow possible to import the types from under `declare global` in `q5.d.ts` as a single type?",

      "description" : "In the customizer we have created a palette control system, so users have a place to manage their palette globally for our themes.  After working on integration with Gutenburg, I've ran into an issue where users are selecting the same color for more than one of the colors in their palette.  In the color settings two colors are selected:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11907254/44623442-402f3400-a89c-11e8-93ca-07bb4f56b0ea.png)\r\n\r\nWhen entering into the editor, the following error:\r\n\r\nWarning: Encountered two children with the same key, `rgb(29, 16, 22)`. Keys should be unique so that components maintain their identity across updates. Non-unique keys may cause children to be duplicated and/or omitted ??? the behavior is unsupported and could change in a future version.\r\n\r\nSince our themes let users change the palette in the customizer, and the color classes are already applied to several elements, it's easy for a user to select the same color twice.\r\n\r\nThis can be reproduced more easily by adding the same color key via the add_theme_support method:\r\n\r\n```\r\nadd_theme_support( 'editor-color-palette', array(\r\n    array(\r\n        'name' => __( 'Dark Background', 'themeLangDomain' ),\r\n        'slug' => 'dark-background',\r\n        'color' => 'rgb(0, 0, 0)',\r\n    ),\r\n    array(\r\n        'name' => __( 'Dark Text', 'themeLangDomain' ),\r\n        'slug' => 'dark-text',\r\n        'color' => 'rgb(0, 0, 0)',\r\n    ),\r\n) );\r\n```\r\nI think that the same color should be allowed to exist in the palette for the use case of allowing a user to easily change their entire palette for a theme via the global controls (ie the customizer), and that the color selected in the editor should be based on the slug key opposed to using the color key as the slug is meant to be unique, whereas a color doesn't necessarily need to be.\r\n\r\nOn an instance by instance basis editing content, it might not make much sense to allow multiple colors, so one way to solve this issue would be to remove duplicate colors and prevent the errors from occurring.  On the other hand as an example of where this is desirable: We have a theme author create a theme with our system and they assign a slot in the palette for the header background color, which is white, and they also assign another slot to the site content's background color, which is also white.  An end user who has the theme and wishes to customize it might want to change the color of their header to something more contrasting with the site content's background, and they can easily do this.  The same palette also impacts all of their site content, so it provides a way for a theme author supplying starter content in their themes a way to declare a relationship of how each slot in a palette effects elements on the site instead of tying the color directly to all elements just because it's the same, and ultimately gives the end users less flexibility.\r\n\r\nThe same issue would be evident when tackling #6941 as it would be easy for a user to select the same color twice as opposed to using a color they have already added in their palette.  \r\n\r\nTested on Gutenberg v3.6.2 & WordPress v4.9.8",

I want them to be able to select header, title, footer, primary, etc. colors that the theme uses. Users will definitely want the ability to specify the same color # for more than one of those. \r\n\r\nGutenberg already places the slug into the source HTML instead of the color, but it just chooses the first slug with the selected color. We would just need it to return the slug of the color that the user selected Is a color picker Instead.", "I am still facing the same issue in 2023, I still don't understand why WordPress uses color as the unique factor. Where the color can be same from time to time. Using slug would be have been the best approach. This is a really big problem.\r\n\r\nMy current hacky workaround is to change the last digit or alphabet of the hex eg: \r\nChange this from  #251046 -> #251045 , So one slug will have : #251046  and the other one will have #251045 , So that WordPress thinks that  its a different color, Hence as per WordPress a different slug. And as per user experience are concerned the difference in the color is not noticeable at all . Hope this helps others as a hacky workaround for the time being, Till WordPress fixes this issue. \r\n\r\n**Before :** \r\n\r\n![Animation22](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28552974/236424975-3028a0a1-3173-41b2-9655-0a06cec3eecc.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n**After :** \r\n\r\n![Animation22](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28552974/236424677-7d0a710e-c25a-4495-adde-dcb737c2146b.gif)\r\n\r\n", "This has caused some issues for us that were very difficult to track down and identify and really should be improved or fixed. \r\n\r\nWe are upgrading from WP 5.4 to WP 5.7. Sometime between 5.4 and 5.7 two new default colors were added by WP / Gutenberg (White and Black with `#ffffff` and `#000000`)\r\n\r\nOur plugin was adding new color themes to the default list of colors and we have a color system that treats the colors as a \"theme\" and then applies that theme styling to the block if that `has-color-<theme>` class is applied. There are several colors palettes such as `Primary`, `Secondary` so classes are added as `has-color-primary` but we also had a `light` and `dark` option which the hex codes for the colors were set as `#ffffff` and `#000000`. \r\n\r\nIn 5.7 we were finding that when the user applied `Light` color the class `has-color-white` would be applied instead of `has-color-light` and so the styling for the \"Light\" theme was lost and not applied. \r\n\r\nIf instead of relying on the color value to apply the corresponding class name for the color it relied on the slug of the registered color it seems like this issue might go away. \r\n\r\nOur current work around is as others have said to go through and change our `Light` and `Dark` registered colors to be a slightly different hex code. However that is going to require updating not just our plugin but a good number of themes that can use a filter to modify the registered colors. \r\n\r\nIf this can't be fixed, at a minimum some documentation should be noted so that people avoid registering colors that have the same color value as any other colors that are registered. It'd be nice to see a warning in the console or editor if 2 colors with the same color value are registered and are going to result in this issue happening and the wrong class name getting applied. ", "I'm also having this problem (on wp: 6.4-beta1-56741; & gut: 16.7.0).\r\nAnd It's really frustrating. \r\nIt slows down the process of creating a theme, since it forces you to change the colors manually.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/assets/679512/0dad326e-61e6-41a7-819a-e412a18a96bb)\r\n\r\nI will use slighly different colors as nathan did [here](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/9357#issuecomment-1535941510) as workaround.\r\n\r\nI hope this gets fixed soon\uD83D\uDE4F", "How is this still not fixed?

This report validates that the issue can be reproduced.\n\n### Environment\n- WordPress: 6.9-alpha-60093-src\n- PHP: 8.2.29\n- Server: Apache/2.4.62 (Debian)\n- Database: mysqli (Server: 11.8.2-MariaDB-ubu2404 / Client: mysqlnd 8.2.29)\n- Browser: Chrome 138.0.0.0\n- OS: Windows 10/11\n- Theme: Twenty Twenty-Five 1.3\n- MU Plugins: None activated\n- Plugins:\n  * Gutenberg 21.3.0-rc.1\n  * Test Reports 1.2.0\n\n### Testing Instructions\n1. Add some extra colours to the `theme.json` **settings > color > palette** like this:\n```json\n{\n\t\"slug\": \"color-one\",\n\t\"name\": \"Color One\",\n\t\"color\": \"#ff0000\"\n},\n{\n\t\"slug\": \"color-two\",\n\t\"name\": \"Color Two\",\n\t\"color\": \"#ff0000\"\n},\n```\n2. Add to blocks in the editor, for example two paragraphs\n3. Select any of these two colours for background, for example\n4. \uD83D\uDC1E Both colours are selected at the same time\n\n### Actual Results\n1.  ??? Error condition occurs (reproduced).\n\n### Additional Notes\n- As many have pointed out, this is still live nowadays. It appears that the palette is prioritizing by the colour and not by the slug, which technically should be the unique ID for anything on WordPress. \n- For this reason, I think that this report is ready for patch and I believe it should not be very complex, so I think it is a good `Good First Bug`. If anyone is willing to take it, please ping me and I will be doing the follow-up testing.\n\n### Supplemental Artifacts\n\nScreencast showcase: https://f003.backblazeb2.com/file/wordpress-videos/wp-videos/2025/07/gb9357.mp4", "@SirLouen I'd love to take this up and submit a fix.

Each order must retain orderId, price, and quantity.\n\nRequirements:\n\n- Support add, modify, and remove operations per order.\n- Efficient access to best bid/ask (top-of-book) and all orders at a given price.\n- bidAtPrice and askAtPrice should return aggregated volume for compatibility with IOrderBook.\n- applyBookUpdate(...) can remain unimplemented or throw; L3 will use per-order events instead.\n\nAvoid allocations in the hot path (preallocate if needed).\n\nAdd tests. Add benchmarks.\n\nWhy this matters:\nL3Book is required for matching engine simulation, advanced strategy research, and realistic replay based on raw order flow.\n\n",

Counting some event (i.e., run-time controlled) or provides a non-zero value when the associated CSR is read (since all 29 perf counters are always implemented but can be read-only-0 if not actually functional).\n\nThe spec seems to contradict itself, as I read it:\n> The Zihpm extension comprises up to 29 additional unprivileged 64-bit hardware performance counters, hpmcounter3-hpmcounter31. When XLEN=32, the upper 32 bits of these performance counters are accessible via additional CSRs hpmcounter3h- hpmcounter31h.\n> \n> The implemented number and width of these additional counters, and the set of events they count, is platform-specific. Accessing an unimplemented or ill-configured counter may cause an illegal-instruction exception or may return a constant value.\nThe execution environment should provide a means to determine the number and width of the implemented counters, and an interface to configure the events to be counted by each counter.\n\nThe first paragraph says the `hpmcounter*` registers are 64-bits wide.\nThe second paragraph says the widths are platform-specific.\n\nIf the width(s) _are_ platform-specific, what are the possibilities? 32 and 64, or any width > 0?\n\nCan different registers be different widths?\n\nAre all the possible \"constant values\" that could be returned when accessing an unimplemented register identical?\n\nThe simplest (and most logical) implementation I think would be:\n- up to 29 additional registers\n- all identical widths\n- valid widths are 32 or 64 bits\n\nSo, this issue needs configuration parameters for:\n- how many additional `hpmevent` registers (up to 29)\n- register width (32 or 64)\n- behavior for access to unimplemented register: illegal instruction or some constant value\n  - what is the constant value\n\nIs that a fair summary? We should probably seek clarification on those questions, but can proceed with the above assumptions for now.", "https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/issues/2160" ],

Write a brief description of how you will approach the task (without using ChatGPT).\n3. Add your Telegram handler in your application (e.g., in OnlyDust or similar)\n4. Write ETA in your application\n\n\n\n## What should I do if I have a problem\n1. Try to google it before asking. Googling is taking major part of dev work \n2. If you couldn't find answer your question with Google, text your question to [dev](https://t.me/spotnet_dev/4) group with your question.\n3. Do not send DM to maintainer, it would be better and faster to ask other contributors in chat \n\n\n## How to prepare PR\n1. Check if your code [smell](https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/smells) good\n2. Add `close #<issue number>` to link your issue with your PR\n3. Do not commit changes that are unrelated to your task\n4. Check after you created PR, if you committed everything\n\n\n## Task Description\n1. In the [handlers folder](./blob/main/margin/margin_app/app/telegram/handlers), create a new file named `admin.py`. Inside, add a handler called `/assets`. Use the [`Admin Filter` from this issue](https://github.com/djeck1432/spotnet/issues/915) to verify the user is an admin. Then, call the [`Assets statistic` method from this issue](https://github.com/djeck1432/spotnet/issues/906) to retrieve the data. Format the response using Telegram Markdown so it displays neatly.\n2. Provide a screenshot demonstrating that the handler works as expected.\n",

Hi, @ThobiWanKenobi, `FSharpEntity.TryGetMetadataText()` is the entry point in the service for this feature. I guess that's where the investigation starts.\n\nAs for the workflow, I'd add a small test case in `FSharp.Compiler.Service.Tests.Symbols` for this. \n", "Okay, I do have two questions. First of all, regarding the workflow. Lets say that I want to work on this, I am trying to set a breakpoint, and want to \"activate\" the line. What solution would I need to build, or what project would I need to run to be able to test this? And finally, I am experiencing a build issue, since the global.json file expects a .NET preview which is not yet publicly available from the downloads page (Specifically 10.0.100-preview.7.25322.101, but only 10.0.100-preview.6) is available for download , how do I handle that?\n\nThanks for the patience and helping me getting started!", "Simple fix for the dotnet issue that works for me, assuming you're using Visual Studio:\nOnce you build from command line e.g. with `Build.cmd -c Debug`, you'll have a `.dotnet` folder in your repo root. Just copy its contents into `C:\\Program Files\\dotnet`. Visual Studio will see it then.\n\nWorking on this particular issue:\n\n1.  If you want to see it in action in actual IDE. You need to build VisualFSharp.sln in debug mode.  Ctrl-T search for `FSharpEntity.TryGetMetadataText` and put a breakpoint there, then start debugging VisualFSharpDebug project. You'll see an experimental instance of VS, open some F# code and F12 on external symbol should activate your breakpoint.\n\n2. Another, faster option is to write a test and debug it. You can use FSharp.Compiler.Service.sln for it. This is cross platform and should work in other IDEs.\n", "Thanks for your help! I will begin working on this and see what I can make up!

I've tried to hit REST endpoint and it seems to be up and running.\n@Siedlerchr @koppor is there a fetcher / mechanism in JabRef that downloads pdfs using REST api?\n[EDIT] OK, It looks like if we want to have possibility to download PDF from Wiley all we have to do is to create account for JabRef on TDM service and generate token. For test purposes I've generated one for myself and was able to download the pdf. Implementation should be simple - just create request with the token and mime type and perform GET. ", "@ankamde   you can simply use the UrlDownload class for such thing, it has a method addHeader\n\nRegarding the token, JabRef has the option to store such tokens in the preferences and use them (see. e.g. IEEE or Springer Fetcher to see how it's done=\n\n<img width=\"1130\" height=\"704\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81fa710a-a1b3-4dc4-abb3-0d30e053b670\" />", "Clarification: This Is a Feature Request, Not a Bug\n\nAfter reviewing the issue, I???d like to clarify that this is not a bug but a new requirement.\n\nCurrent Behavior\nThe application allows PDF downloads in two workflows:\n\n1. Search Full Text Documents Online\n2. Get Full Text (in the General tab)\n\nIn both cases, the system expects to:\n\n1. Download PDFs via direct URLs (simple HTTP GET)\n2. Store the PDF URL in the BibLaTeX url field\n\nWiley now provides an official REST API for Text and Data Mining (TDM):\nhttps://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/{DOI}\n\nThis API:\n\n1. Requires an API key\n2. Uses DOI-based queries\n3. Returns metadata and download links, not direct PDFs via simple URLs\n\nWhy This Is a Feature Request?\n\nCurrent System\n1. Handles direct PDF URLs\n2. Adds PDF URLs to url field BibLaTeX \n3. No authentication needed\n\nNew Requirement\n1. Needs REST API calls\n2. Wiley API URLs are not public/stable links\n3. Requires API key & headers\n\nAdditional Considerations\n\nThe Wiley API must be supported in both workflows:\n\n- Search Full Text Documents Online\n- Get Full Text (General tab)\n\nWiley REST API links should not be stored in url fields because:\n\n- They are temporary / protected API endpoints\n- They are not intended for bibliographic use\n- We can store direct link to pdf (but it won't be used to download) https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/we.2952 \n\nInstead, we should:\n\n1. Attach the downloaded PDF locally\n2. Retain the DOI as the main reference\n3. Optionally note that the PDF was retrieved via the Wiley API\n\nProposal\n\n1. Treat Wiley API integration as a new feature, not a bug fix\n2. Add Wiley REST API support as a special case\n3. Preserve current logic for other publishers (no changes to direct URL downloads)\n4. Avoid adding Wiley API URLs to BibLaTeX url fields\n\n@Siedlerchr @koppor Could you comment on my proposal, please?", "@ankamde It is very OK to treat that as feature. Regarding \"we should\": Steps 1 and 2 are the desired behavior, go ahead. Step 3 is not necessary; users typically don't care where a PDF is coming from, it just needs to be there." ],

This often leads to a confusing and sometimes startling experience, as users are left wondering \"Where is it coming from?\" This unexpected audio can detract from the initial immersion and create a negative first impression, especially for new users who are still learning the environment.\n\n## Solution\n\nChange Default Setting: Modify the default value for the \"Auto-play media\" setting in the \"Sound & Media\" section of the Preferences to \"Ask.\"\n\n## Screenshots\n\n<img width=\"650\" height=\"533\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/042d759d-0fa2-4fed-a227-5983b7f03791\" />\n<br/>\n<hr/>\n\n<details><summary>This repo is using Opire - what does it mean? \uD83D\uDC47</summary><br/>\uD83D\uDCB5 Everyone can add rewards for this issue commenting <code>/reward 100</code> (replace <code>100</code> with the amount).<br/>\uD83D\uDD75????????????

So I would suggest to show the comment button but in a disabled state and some text like 'Comments (disabled)' or something like that to visualize that this activity is disabled on purpose and not desired for the instance/account.

Generate a Strong, Random Key:\n\nFor development and testing, you can often use a simple command provided by your framework. For example:\n\nRuby on Rails:\n\nBash\n\nrails secret\n# Example Output: 9f0e1a2b3c4d5e6f7a8b9c0d1e2f3a4b5c6d7e8f9a0b1c2d3e4f5a6b7c8d9e0f\nGeneral (using OpenSSL):\n\nBash\n\nopenssl rand -hex 64\n# This generates a 128-character hexadecimal string\nIt is highly recommended to use a different, unique SECRET_KEY_BASE for each environment (development, staging, production) to limit the blast radius if one environment's key is compromised.\n\n2. Set as an Environment Variable:\n\nHow you set the environment variable depends on your operating system and deployment method:\n\nLocal Development (Temporarily for a session):\n\nBash\n\nexport SECRET_KEY_BASE=\"YOUR_GENERATED_SECRET_KEY_HERE\"\n# Then run your application: e.g., rails server\nNote: This variable will be lost when you close your terminal session.\n\nLocal Development (Persistently for an application):\nFor local development, you might use a .env file (if your project uses dotenv or similar libraries).\n\n# .env\nSECRET_KEY_BASE=YOUR_GENERATED_SECRET_KEY_HERE\nMake sure .env is listed in your .gitignore to prevent it from being committed.\n\nProduction Deployment:\n\nHeroku: Use heroku config:set SECRET_KEY_BASE=\"YOUR_GENERATED_SECRET_KEY_HERE\"\n\nDocker/Kubernetes: Pass it as an environment variable in your Dockerfile or Kubernetes deployment manifest (but ideally, use a secrets management system like Kubernetes Secrets, AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, etc., rather than hardcoding in manifests).\n\nServer (e.g., AWS EC2, DigitalOcean Droplet): Set it in your server's environment configuration (e.g., /etc/environment, systemd service files, or a specific user's .bashrc/.profile for the user running the application, though a service file is generally preferred for production).\n\nExample for a systemd service file (snippet):\n\n# /etc/systemd/system/your_app.service\n[Service]\nEnvironment=\"SECRET_KEY_BASE=YOUR_GENERATED_SECRET_KEY_HERE\"\n# ... other configurations\nExample .env file (for local development, add to .gitignore):\n\n# .env - This file is for local development only and should NOT be committed to Git.\nFir Example:\nSECRET_KEY_BASE=a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4c5d6e7f8a9b0c1d2e3f4a5b6c7d8e9f0a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4c5d6e7f8a9b0c1d2e3f4a5b6c7d8e9f0\nDATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/your_database_dev\n# Add other local environment variables here  \nI hope That is  a good documentation for this problem ,if you have any doubt please comment @supabase-automated-user ", "@fsansalvadore @maintainers Is this PR still active? If not, I???d like to help document SECRET_KEY_BASE.", "@maintainers I'd like to help document SECRET_KEY_BASE. I'll:\n- Clarify how to generate it (OpenSSL/Rails commands)\n- Explain where to set it (.env, production environments)\n- Address the hardcoded values concern\n- Incorporate all suggestions from this thread\n\nPlease confirm if this is still available to work on." ],

Other sidebar links like **TV Shows**, **Movies**, and **My List** do not redirect to any page or load content.\n\nThis breaks the navigation experience and limits user interaction across different content sections.\n\n### \uD83D\uDCA1 What do I suggest?\n\n* Add appropriate `href` routes or JavaScript navigation handlers for the non-functional links.\n* Create new pages or components like:\n\n  * `tv-shows.html`\n  * `movies.html`\n  * `my-list.html`\n* Ensure the links load respective content/pages, even if with placeholders initially.\n\n### \uD83C\uDFAF Why is this important?\n\n* Improves user experience and app structure.\n* Essential for a realistic Netflix-like navigation layout.\n* Enables future enhancement like filtering, user lists, and categories.\n\n\n\n\n\n### ?????? How will you solve it?\n\n### ?????? Solution Outline\n\n*Star the repository\n*Fork the repository \n* Create and link new HTML pages or routes.\n* Update sidebar `<a>` tags with correct `href` values.\n* Add dummy or placeholder content.\n* Ensure navigation is responsive and consistent across screen sizes.\n\n\n### ???

Yes, there are a few points that are related to these tasks which if not moved forward it might block you. Right now @aguilar1x is working on it hence, it would be good to leave the points that are in that issue to him while you can take the rest of the acceptance criteria that are left to be done.\n\nI would suggest reaching out to Aguilarx1 to sync what he has done so far so you can know where your code will join with his and avoid duplications as much as possible.\n\ncc - @Bran18 " ],

      "description" : "### Checklist\n\n- [X] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues) for similar issues.\n- [X] I added a very descriptive title to this issue.\n- [X] I have provided sufficient information below to help reproduce this issue.\n\n### Summary\n\nThis has had [a few comments in the forum](https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/cant-stop-streamlit-app-using-ctrl-c-if-the-app-has-been-closed-in-the-browser/38738) and I couldn't find mention in a current or closed issue, so documenting here. This is merely a minor inconvenience with an easy workaround for most, but noting for completeness/future searches.\r\n\r\nIn Windows, the `streamlit run` process cannot be terminated from command line with `Ctrl+C` if there are no connected tabs. The terminal itself must either be closed or a new tab open and connected to the session to register if `Ctrl+C` has been typed. The forum thread mentions a connection to tornado.\n\n### Reproducible Code Example\n\n```Python\n# Any valid streamlit app\r\nimport streamlit as st\r\nst.write('hi')\n```\n\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. From a terminal in Windows, `streamlit run app.py`.\r\n2. Close any/all tabs connected to the session.\r\n3. Ctrl+C in the terminal\r\n(nothing happens)\r\n4. Open a tab and connect to the session\r\n(terminal immediately registers the previous command and correctly proceeds `Stopping...`)\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nCtrl+C should stop the process even if there are no active users\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nA connected tab is required to stop the process without closing the terminal\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\n\n### Debug info\n\n- Streamlit version: 1.23.0\r\n- Python version: 3.10.11\r\n- Operating System: Windows 10\r\n- Browser: Edge...or rather \"none\"\r\n- Virtual environment: Conda\r\n\n\n### Additional Information\n\nThematically related to #6611\n\n### Are you willing to submit a PR?\n\n- [ ] Yes, I am willing to submit a PR!",

      "description" : "### Describe the feature in detail (code, mocks, or screenshots encouraged)\n\nBuilding off of https://github.com/skeletonlabs/skeleton/issues/3588\n\nWe should aim to do a pass through the Skeleton components that implement `btn-icon` and ensure these have the appropriate props to set both the `title` and `aria-label` attribute per each. Additionally, each prop should contain a default value. The idea is these labels should describe the action in as succinct a manner possible in English. But given they are a prop so they can modified as needed for i18n purposes.\n\n### How to Update\n\nSetting up a new component props has a few steps:\n\n> NOTE: remember to keep both the Svelte (.svelte) and React (.tsx) components in sync\n\n1. Add an optional prop to the component's respective `types.ts` file\n2. Add a semantic JSDoc description for each prop in `types.ts`\n3. Register the new prop in the component and set a default value\n4. Add the prop to the template for each icon button\n\nWe do no have a naming convention for `title` or `aria-label` attributes at present, but we should be able to keep these similar to [style prop conventions](https://www.skeleton.dev/docs/resources/contribute/components#style-prop-conventions):\n\n- If the icon button is the root element -> no prefix needed\n- If the icon button is a child element -> prefix as `fooTitle` and `fooAriaLabel`\n\nWhere `foo` represents the semantic prefix name already in use for class props, derived from Zag's spread methods, or if need be a new semantic name can be implemented.\n\n### Attribute Presets\n\nPer the attribute values themselves, remember they should describe the purpose of the button, not just summarize the icon, especially the `aria-label` for screen reader users.\n\n- BAD: `title=\"Arrow\"` -> this does not describe the purpose of the button\n- GOOD: `title=\"Submit\"` -> this is a good and semantic description of the button\n\n### What type of pull request would this be?\n\nEnhancement\n\n### Provide relevant links or additional information.\n\nThe following components were reported to make use of the `btn-icon` class in .svelte/.tsx files, but I'd welcome a new dedicated audit to confirm.\n\n> NOTE the component is the focus of this request, maintaining the playground is optional (but welcome)\n\n```\n- packages/skeleton-svelte/src/components/Toast/Toaster.svelte\n- playgrounds/skeleton-svelte/src/routes/components/app-bars/+page.svelte\n- playgrounds/skeleton-svelte/src/routes/components/popover/+page.svelte\n- packages/skeleton-react/src/components/Toast/Toaster.tsx\n- sites/themes.skeleton.dev/src/lib/components/common/Lightswitch/Lightswitch.svelte\n- sites/themes.skeleton.dev/src/lib/components/generator/Controls/Controls.svelte\n- playgrounds/skeleton-react/src/app/components/app-bar/page.tsx\n- sites/skeleton.dev/src/components/homepage/HomeCompGrid.svelte\n- sites/skeleton.dev/src/examples/guides/cookbook/stepper/Example.svelte\n- sites/skeleton.dev/src/examples/components/popover/ExamplePopover.tsx\n- sites/skeleton.dev/src/examples/components/popover/ExamplePopover.svelte\n```",

Alternatively, leave them visible but with a note like \"No products available in this store.\"\n\nWhy It???s Needed:\n\n    - Clear Communication: A more informative message will prevent confusion and help users understand the status of the store.\n\n   -  Better User Experience: This change would make the interface more intuitive by letting users know that the store is empty, instead of implying that there???s a filtering issue.\n\n    - Transparency: It enhances the overall user experience by managing expectations about the availability of products across different stores. \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6853f10b-55eb-4cf2-851c-d8bd27329a4f)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/026001af-0cab-4d64-9745-41ab77f46d76)",

And have reduced the problem to a minimal example.\r\n\r\nNote I'm a noob and maybe I'm missing something, but haven't been able to find anything in docs, issues, discussions about how to, properly, stop/close a connection. Also note that this problem, apparently, doesn't cause any trouble and everything seems to be working ok, just it's annoying to get all those warnings in RabbitMQ logs.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce**\r\n```python\r\nimport asyncio\r\n\r\nfrom faststream.rabbit import RabbitBroker\r\n\r\n# Usage example\r\nasync def main():\r\n\r\n    broker = RabbitBroker(\"amqp://user:pass@localhost:5672\")\r\n\r\n    await broker.start()\r\n    await asyncio.sleep(3)\r\n    await broker.close()\r\n\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    asyncio.run(main())\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd/Or steps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\n1.

User taps on a chat icon in the app\n2. A modal/chat screen opens\n3. User types a question or news-related prompt\n4. Chatbot responds using the Gemini API\n5. Past conversations can optionally be stored locally or in Firestore\n\n---\n\n**Tech Stack**\n- Dart / Flutter\n- flutter_bloc for state management\n- Gemini API via HTTP\n\n---\n\n**UI Ideas**\n- Floating Action Button ??? Chat Overlay\n- Chat bubble layout (like WhatsApp/Messenger)\n- Show loading shimmer while bot \"thinks\"\n- Support image/news link previews in chat\n\n---\n\n**Why Me?**\nI'm a GSSoC contributor excited about Flutter, NLP, and building helpful AI tools. I'd love to implement the first version of this chatbot and iterate based on mentor feedback.\n\nPlease assign this issue to me.\n",

      "description" : "## Description of bug / unexpected behavior\r\nIn the [Manim???s building blocks > Creating a custom animation](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/tutorials/building_blocks.html#creating-a-custom-animation) section of the documentation, it is not made clear that the rate function must be explicitly called on the `alpha` parameter in `interpolate_mobject()` in order to allow for the usage of the `rate_func` parameter to work as intended.\r\n\r\n### From that page:\r\n> So, you just have to manipulate `self.mobject` inside `Animation` according to the `alpha` value in its `interpolate_mobject` method. Then you get all the benefits of [Animation](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/reference/manim.animation.animation.Animation.html#manim.animation.animation.Animation) such as playing it for different run times or using different rate functions.\r\n> [...]\r\n> The only thing that you need to do is to define how you want it to look at every step of the animation. Manim provides you with the `alpha` value in the [interpolate_mobject()](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/reference/manim.animation.animation.Animation.html#manim.animation.animation.Animation.interpolate_mobject) method based on frame rate of video, **_rate function,_** and run time of animation played.\r\n\r\n### The code given:\r\n```\r\nfrom manim import *\r\n\r\nclass Count(Animation):\r\n    def __init__(self, number: DecimalNumber, start: float, end: float, **kwargs) -> None:\r\n        # Pass number as the mobject of the animation\r\n        super().__init__(number,  **kwargs)\r\n        # Set start and end\r\n        self.start = start\r\n        self.end = end\r\n\r\n    def interpolate_mobject(self, alpha: float) -> None:\r\n        # Set value of DecimalNumber according to alpha\r\n        value = self.start + (alpha * (self.end - self.start))\r\n        self.mobject.set_value(value)\r\n\r\n\r\nclass CountingScene(Scene):\r\n    def construct(self):\r\n        # Create Decimal Number and add it to scene\r\n        number = DecimalNumber().set_color(WHITE).scale(5)\r\n        # Add an updater to keep the DecimalNumber centered as its value changes\r\n        number.add_updater(lambda number: number.move_to(ORIGIN))\r\n\r\n        self.add(number)\r\n\r\n        self.wait()\r\n\r\n        # Play the Count Animation to count from 0 to 100 in 4 seconds\r\n        self.play(Count(number, 0, 100), run_time=4, rate_func=linear)\r\n\r\n        self.wait()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis excerpt (along with the code given after it) gives the impression that the `alpha` parameter is already adjusted for the rate function (if one is specified) and can be used directly, which is NOT the case. For example, a `rate_func` is specified as an argument to `play()` in the code above when in this case the `rate_func` parameter would have no effect whatsoever. In the current manim version, if one wishes to support different rate functions, it is required to call `self.rate_func()` on `alpha` instead of using `alpha` directly.\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\nThe documentation should be more descriptive and provide a better code snippet with the proper implementation of rate functions for custom animations.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How to reproduce the issue\r\nThis is a page from the official documentation.\r\n",

Each Python file should contain a standardized header with its relative path location for improved navigation and documentation consistency.\n\n---\n\n### \uD83E\uDDF1 Area Affected\n\nChoose the general area(s) that this chore affects:\n\n- [x] Pre-commit hooks / linters\n- [x] Formatting (black, isort, ruff, etc.)\n- [x] Build system or `Makefile`\n- [x] Docs or spellcheck\n\n---\n\n### ?????? Context / Rationale\n\nCurrently, source files lack consistent location headers, making it difficult to:\n- Navigate large codebases efficiently\n- Understand file organization when viewing individual files\n- Maintain documentation consistency across the project\n- Quickly identify file locations during code reviews\n\nThis script will standardize headers across all Python files with the format:\n```python\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n\"\"\"Module Description.\nLocation: ./relative/path/to/file.py\n\nCopyright 2025\nSPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0\nAuthors: Mihai Criveti\n\nModule documentation...\n\"\"\"\n```\n\nThis reduces tech debt and improves developer experience by providing consistent file location context.\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDCE6 Related Make Targets\n\nReference any relevant Makefile targets that are involved, if applicable:\n\n- `make lint` - run ruff, mypy, flake8, etc. (should pass after header updates)\n- `make pre-commit` - run pre-configured hooks (may need to handle new headers)\n- `make check-headers` - new target to validate file headers using `.github/tools/fix_file_headers.py --check`\n- `make fix-headers` - new target to automatically fix missing/incorrect headers using `.github/tools/fix_file_headers.py --fix-all`\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDCCB Acceptance Criteria\n\nDefine what \"done\" looks like for this task.\n\n**Script Requirements:**\n- [ ] Script implemented at `.github/tools/fix_file_headers.py`\n- [ ] Script can scan all Python files in the project\n- [ ] Script can detect missing or incorrect relative path headers\n- [ ] Script provides interactive mode to review and approve changes\n- [ ] Script provides batch mode for automated fixes\n- [ ] Script preserves existing docstring content while updating location\n- [ ] Script handles edge cases (files without docstrings, existing headers, etc.)\n\n**Implementation Requirements:**\n- [ ] Script follows the standardized header format shown in example\n- [ ] All Python files have correct relative path headers after running\n- [ ] Headers maintain consistent formatting and structure\n- [ ] Copyright and license information is preserved/added consistently\n\n**Quality Checks:**\n- [ ] Linter runs cleanly (`make lint`)\n- [ ] CI passes with no regressions\n- [ ] No existing functionality is broken\n- [ ] Script can be integrated into pre-commit hooks (optional)\n\n**Documentation:**\n- [ ] Script usage is documented with examples\n- [ ] Makefile targets are added for header management\n- [ ] Header format is documented for future reference\n\n---\n\n### \uD83E\uDDE9 Additional Notes\n\n**Technical Implementation Notes:**\n- Script should be placed in `.github/tools/fix_file_headers.py`\n- Use Python's `ast` module to safely parse and modify Python files\n- Preserve original file encodings and line endings\n- Handle files that already have partial headers gracefully\n- Consider using `pathlib` for cross-platform path handling\n\n**File Selection Criteria:**\n- Target `.py` files in project directories\n- Exclude virtual environments, build directories, and `.git`\n- Focus on source code files (`mcpgateway/`, `tests/`, etc.)\n\n**Header Template Variables:**\n- `Location`: Relative path from project root (e.g., `./mcpgateway/services/gateway_service.py`)\n- `Copyright`: Current year (2025)\n- `Authors`: Configurable, default to \"Mihai Criveti\"\n- `License`: Apache-2.0 (consistent with project)\n\n**Integration Considerations:**\n- Script should be idempotent (safe to run multiple times)\n- Consider adding to pre-commit hooks for new files\n- May need to update existing CI/CD checks that parse file headers\n- Ensure script works with different Python file structures (modules, packages, scripts)\n\n**Example Command Usage:**\n```bash\n# Check which files need header updates (dry-run)\npython .github/tools/fix_file_headers.py --check\n\n# Interactively review and apply changes\npython .github/tools/fix_file_headers.py --interactive\n\n# Automatically fix all files (batch mode)\npython .github/tools/fix_file_headers.py --fix-all\n\n# Fix specific directory\npython .github/tools/fix_file_headers.py --fix --path mcpgateway/services/\n```",

      "description" : "## Summary\n\nImplement a comprehensive onboarding wizard that guides new BirdNET-Go users through initial setup, educates them about AI limitations, and provides an interactive tour of the web interface. This will significantly improve the first-time user experience and reduce configuration errors.\n\n**\uD83D\uDCDD Note: This feature proposal is open for comments and feedback from the community. Please share your thoughts on the design, suggest improvements, or indicate which aspects would be most valuable to you.**\n\n## Background\n\nNew users currently need to manually configure BirdNET-Go through YAML files or the web interface without guided assistance. This can be overwhelming and may lead to suboptimal configurations or missed features. An onboarding wizard would:\n\n- Guide users through essential configuration steps\n- Educate about AI model limitations and appropriate use cases\n- Showcase key features through an interactive tour\n- Provide option to import existing BirdNET-Pi data\n- Ensure users understand privacy implications and data sharing options\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n### 1. Welcome Screen\n\nOn first launch, display a modal dialog with:\n\n```\nWelcome to BirdNET-Go!\n\nBirdNET-Go is powered by the BirdNET Analyzer AI model developed by\nthe BirdNET Team at Cornell Lab of Ornithology and Chemnitz University\nof Technology. Learn more at github.com/birdnet-team/BirdNET-Analyzer\n\nReady to set up your bird monitoring station?\n\n[Get Started] [Import from BirdNET-Pi]\n```\n\n### 2. Setup Wizard (6 Steps)\n\n#### Step 1: Location Configuration\n- Interactive map widget for setting latitude/longitude\n- Auto-detect location option (with permission)\n- Display: \"Your location helps filter species to those likely in your area\"\n- Show preview of common species for the selected location\n\n#### Step 2: Audio Source\n- Radio buttons for audio source selection:\n  - \uD83C\uDFA4 Microphone/Soundcard (default)\n  - \uD83D\uDCF9 RTSP Stream\n  - \uD83D\uDD0A Multiple Sources\n- Audio level meter showing real-time input\n- \"Test Audio\" button with visual feedback\n- Troubleshooting link if no audio detected\n\n#### Step 3: Language & Display\n- Dropdown with 40+ language options for species names\n- Time format toggle (12/24 hour)\n- Timezone selection (auto-detect with override option)\n- Preview of species name in selected language\n\n#### Step 4: Detection Settings\n- Preset selection with descriptions:\n  ```\n  ?????? Balanced (Recommended)\n  Good balance of accuracy and sensitivity\n  ??? Confidence threshold: 0.8\n  ??? Sensitivity: 1.0\n  \n  \uD83C\uDFAF High Accuracy\n  Fewer false positives, may miss some birds\n  ??? Confidence threshold: 0.9\n  ??? Deep Detection enabled\n  \n  \uD83D\uDCE1 High Sensitivity  \n  Detects more birds, more false positives\n  ??? Confidence threshold: 0.6\n  ??? Sensitivity: 1.25\n  ```\n- \"Show Advanced Settings\" expandable section\n\n#### Step 5: Privacy & Integration\n- Privacy options:\n  - [ ] Enable privacy filter (removes detections when human voices detected)\n  - [ ] Enable dog bark filter (reduces false owl/crow detections)\n- Data sharing:\n  - [ ] Share detections with BirdWeather community\n  - [ ] Enable anonymous telemetry to help improve BirdNET-Go\n- Audio retention:\n  - Export audio clips: [Yes/No]\n  - Retention policy: [7 days / 30 days / Forever]\n\n### 3. Interactive Web UI Tour\n\nUsing a JavaScript tour library (e.g., Shepherd.js), create guided tour with these stops:\n\n1. **Dashboard Overview**\n   ```\n   Spotlight: Main dashboard area\n   \"This is your command center. Recent detections appear here\n   in real-time. The summary shows your most detected species.\"\n   ```\n\n2. **Detection Details**\n   ```\n   Spotlight: Detection row\n   \"Click any detection to see the spectrogram, listen to audio,\n   and verify or correct the identification.\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Live Audio Stream**\n   ```\n   Spotlight: Audio level indicator\n   \"Click here to listen to your live audio feed and check\n   microphone placement.\"\n   ```\n\n4. **Settings Access**\n   ```\n   Spotlight: Settings menu\n   \"Fine-tune detection parameters, manage species lists,\n   and configure integrations here.\"\n   ```\n\n5. **Species Management**\n   ```\n   Spotlight: Species settings\n   \"Add species to always include or exclude, and set\n   custom thresholds for specific birds.\"\n   ```\n\n### 4. BirdNET-Pi Import\n\nIf user selects import option:\n\n```\nImport from BirdNET-Pi\n\n1. Upload your BirdNET-Pi database:\n   [Choose File] (Accepts: birds.db, *.sqlite)\n\n2. Import options:\n   [???] Historical detections\n   [???] Species include/exclude lists\n   [???] Custom species settings\n   [ ] Audio recordings (if available)\n\n3. Date range:\n   From: [Date picker] To: [Date picker]\n\n[Import] [Skip]\n\nProgress: [??????????????????????????????] 80% - Importing detections...\n```\n\n### 5. Completion Screen\n\n```\n??? Setup Complete!\n\nBirdNET-Go is now monitoring for bird sounds.\n\nQuick tips:\n??? First detections may take 15-30 seconds to appear\n??? Check Settings ??? Range Filter to see species expected in your area\n??? Enable notifications for rare bird alerts\n??? Join our community forum for tips and support\n\n[View Dashboard] [Documentation] [Run Tour Again]\n```\n\n### 6. Responsible Use Guidelines (Final Step)\n\nAfter setup completion, display this important information:\n\n```\n\uD83E\uDD9C Using BirdNET-Go Responsibly\n\nBirdNET-Go is a powerful tool that enhances your birding experience through\nAI-assisted identification. To ensure the best outcomes for both birding \nand conservation:\n\n??? Review and verify detections before sharing observations\n??? Use the confidence scores as a guide, not absolute truth\n???

      "title" : "[Docs]: Add Developer Guide for using MCP via the CLI (curl commands, JSON-RPC)",
      "url" : "https://github.com/IBM/mcp-context-forge/issues/19",
      "repositoryName" : "IBM/mcp-context-forge",
      "description" : "## Overview\n\nThis guide demonstrates how to interact with MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers using raw JSON-RPC commands via `curl` or through STDIO. This is useful for developers who want to understand the protocol at a low level or integrate MCP into custom applications.\n\nThis also serves as a sanity check to test / debug the MCP implementation provided by the gateway.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- MCP Gateway server running (typically on `http://localhost:4444`)\n- Authentication token generated (if required)\n- `curl` command-line tool\n- `jq` for JSON formatting (optional but recommended)\n\n## Authentication Setup\n\nBefore making any requests, generate a bearer token:\n\n```bash\n# Generate authentication token\nexport MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN=$(python3 -m mcpgateway.utils.create_jwt_token -u admin --secret my-test-key)\necho ${MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN}\n\n# Test connectivity\ncurl -s -k -H \"Authorization: Bearer $MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN\" http://localhost:4444/health\n```\n\n## MCP Protocol Flow\n\n### 1. Initialize the Protocol\n\nEvery MCP session must start with an initialization handshake. **Note**: There's currently a bug with the `initialize` method via `/rpc` endpoint, so use the dedicated protocol endpoint:\n\n```bash\n# Initialize the protocol (RECOMMENDED - works around /rpc bug)\ncurl -X POST -H \"Authorization: Bearer $MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN\" \\\n     -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n     -d '{\n           \"protocol_version\":\"2025-03-26\",\n           \"capabilities\":{},\n           \"client_info\":{\"name\":\"demo\",\"version\":\"0.0.1\"}\n         }' \\\n     http://localhost:4444/protocol/initialize\n\n# Alternative: Via /rpc (currently has a bug - see troubleshooting)\n# curl -X POST -H \"Authorization: Bearer $MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN\" \\\n#      -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n#      -d '{\n#            \"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\n#            \"id\":1,\n#            \"method\":\"initialize\",\n#            \"params\":{\n#              \"protocolVersion\":\"2025-03-26\",\n#              \"capabilities\":{},\n#              \"clientInfo\":{\"name\":\"demo\",\"version\":\"0.0.1\"}\n#            }\n#          }' \\\n#      http://localhost:4444/rpc\n```\n\n**Expected Response:**\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\n  \"id\":1,\n  \"result\":{\n    \"protocolVersion\":\"2025-03-26\",\n    \"capabilities\":{\n      \"experimental\":{},\n      \"prompts\":{\"listChanged\":false},\n      \"resources\":{\"subscribe\":false,\"listChanged\":false},\n      \"tools\":{\"listChanged\":false}\n    },\n    \"serverInfo\":{\"name\":\"mcpgateway-wrapper\",\"version\":\"0.2.0\"}\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Send Initialization Notification\n\nAfter successful initialization, send the initialized notification:\n\n```bash\n# Send initialized notification\ncurl -X POST -H \"Authorization: Bearer $MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN\" \\\n     -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n     -d '{\n           \"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\n           \"method\":\"notifications/initialized\",\n           \"params\":{}\n         }' \\\n     http://localhost:4444/rpc\n```\n\n## Alternative: Server-Sent Events (SSE) Approach\n\nFor more robust communication, especially when dealing with multiple requests or when the `/rpc` endpoint has issues, you can use the SSE-based approach:\n\n### Establishing SSE Connection\n\n```bash\n# Terminal 1: Start SSE connection (keeps connection open)\ncurl -N -H \"Authorization: Bearer $MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN\" \\\n     http://localhost:4444/sse\n```\n\nThis will establish a persistent connection and you'll see responses in real-time.\n\n### Sending Messages via SSE\n\nIn a separate terminal, send JSON-RPC messages:\n\n```bash\n# Initialize\ncurl -X POST -H \"Authorization: Bearer $MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN\" \\\n     -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n     -d '{\n           \"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\n           \"id\":1,\n           \"method\":\"initialize\",\n           \"params\":{\n             \"protocolVersion\":\"2025-03-26\",\n             \"capabilities\":{},\n             \"clientInfo\":{\"name\":\"demo\",\"version\":\"0.0.1\"}\n           }\n         }' \\\n     http://localhost:4444/message\n\n# List tools\ncurl -X POST -H \"Authorization: Bearer $MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN\" \\\n     -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n     -d '{\n           \"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\n           \"id\":2,\n           \"method\":\"tools/list\"\n         }' \\\n     http://localhost:4444/message\n\n# Call a tool\ncurl -X POST -H \"Authorization: Bearer $MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN\" \\\n     -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n     -d '{\n           \"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\n           \"id\":3,\n           \"method\":\"tools/call\",\n           \"params\":{\n             \"name\":\"get_current_time\",\n             \"arguments\":{\"timezone\":\"Europe/Dublin\"}\n           }\n         }' \\\n     http://localhost:4444/message\n```\n\nThe SSE approach provides real-time responses and avoids the async/await issues present in the `/rpc` endpoint.\n\n## Working with Tools\n\n### List Available Tools\n\n```bash\n# List all tools\ncurl -X POST -H \"Authorization: Bearer $MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN\" \\\n     -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n     -d '{\n           \"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\n           \"id\":2,\n           \"method\":\"tools/list\"\n         }' \\\n     http://localhost:4444/rpc\n```\n\n**Expected Response (no tools):**\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\n  \"id\":2,\n  \"result\":{\"tools\":[]}\n}\n```\n\n**Expected Response (with tools):**\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\n  \"id\":2,\n  \"result\":{\n    \"tools\":[\n      {\n        \"name\":\"get_current_time\",\n        \"description\":\"Get current time in a specific timezone\",\n        \"inputSchema\":{\n          \"type\":\"object\",\n          \"properties\":{\n            \"timezone\":{\n              \"type\":\"string\",\n              \"description\":\"IANA timezone name (e.g., 'America/New_York', 'Europe/London'). Use 'America/New_York' as local timezone if no timezone provided by the user.\"\n            }\n          },\n          \"required\":[\"timezone\"]\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Call a Tool\n\n```bash\n# Call the get_current_time tool\ncurl -X POST -H \"Authorization: Bearer $MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN\" \\\n     -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n     -d '{\n           \"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\n           \"id\":3,\n           \"method\":\"tools/call\",\n           \"params\":{\n             \"name\":\"get_current_time\",\n             \"arguments\":{\"timezone\":\"Europe/Dublin\"}\n           }\n         }' \\\n     http://localhost:4444/rpc\n```\n\n**Expected Response:**\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\n  \"id\":3,\n  \"result\":{\n    \"content\":[\n      {\n        \"type\":\"text\",\n        \"text\":\"{\\n  \\\"timezone\\\": \\\"Europe/Dublin\\\",\\n  \\\"datetime\\\": \\\"2025-06-08T21:47:07+01:00\\\",\\n  \\\"is_dst\\\": true\\n}\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"isError\":false\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Working with Prompts\n\n### List Available Prompts\n\n```bash\n# List all prompts\ncurl -X POST -H \"Authorization: Bearer $MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN\" \\\n     -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n     -d '{\n           \"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\n           \"id\":4,\n           \"method\":\"prompts/list\"\n         }' \\\n     http://localhost:4444/rpc\n```\n\n### Get a Specific Prompt\n\n```bash\n# Get a prompt with arguments\ncurl -X POST -H \"Authorization: Bearer $MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN\" \\\n     -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n     -d '{\n           \"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\n           \"id\":5,\n           \"method\":\"prompts/get\",\n           \"params\":{\n             \"name\":\"greeting\",\n             \"arguments\":{\"user\":\"Bob\"}\n           }\n         }' \\\n     http://localhost:4444/rpc\n```\n\n## Working with Resources\n\n### List Available Resources\n\n```bash\n# List all resources\ncurl -X POST -H \"Authorization: Bearer $MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN\" \\\n     -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n     -d '{\n           \"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\n           \"id\":6,\n           \"method\":\"resources/list\"\n         }' \\\n     http://localhost:4444/rpc\n```\n\n### Read a Resource\n\n```bash\n# Read a specific resource\ncurl -X POST -H \"Authorization: Bearer $MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN\" \\\n     -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n     -d '{\n           \"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\n           \"id\":7,\n           \"method\":\"resources/read\",\n           \"params\":{\n             \"uri\":\"https://example.com/some.txt\"\n           }\n         }' \\\n     http://localhost:4444/rpc\n```\n\n## Utility Methods\n\n### Ping the Server\n\n```bash\n# Ping to test connectivity\ncurl -X POST -H \"Authorization: Bearer $MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN\" \\\n     -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n     -d '{\n           \"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\n           \"id\":8,\n           \"method\":\"ping\"\n         }' \\\n     http://localhost:4444/rpc\n```\n\n**Expected Response:**\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\n  \"id\":8,\n  \"result\":{}\n}\n```\n\n## Using with STDIO\n\nFor STDIO usage, you can use the MCP Gateway Wrapper:\n\n```bash\n# Set environment variables\nexport MCP_AUTH_TOKEN=${MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN}\nexport MCP_SERVER_CATALOG_URLS=http://localhost:4444/servers/1\nexport MCP_TOOL_CALL_TIMEOUT=120\n\n# Run the wrapper\npython3 -m mcpgateway.wrapper\n```\n\nThen send JSON-RPC commands directly to stdin:\n\n```json\n{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":1,\"method\":\"initialize\",\"params\":{\"protocolVersion\":\"2025-03-26\",\"capabilities\":{},\"clientInfo\":{\"name\":\"demo\",\"version\":\"0.0.1\"}}}\n{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"method\":\"notifications/initialized\",\"params\":{}}\n{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":2,\"method\":\"tools/list\"}\n```\n\n## Error Handling\n\nMCP follows JSON-RPC 2.0 error handling. Common error responses:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\n  \"id\":1,\n  \"error\":{\n    \"code\":-32602,\n    \"message\":\"Invalid params\",\n    \"data\":\"Missing required parameter: name\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Common Error Codes\n\n- `-32700`: Parse error\n- `-32600`: Invalid Request\n- `-32601`: Method not found\n- `-32602`: Invalid params\n- `-32603`: Internal error\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Always initialize first**: Start every session with the initialize method\n2. **Use appropriate timeouts**: Set reasonable timeouts for tool calls\n3. **Handle errors gracefully**: Check for error objects in responses\n4. **Use unique IDs**: Ensure each request has a unique ID for correlation\n5. **Follow the protocol**: Send the initialized notification after successful initialization\n\n## Example Complete Session\n\nHere's a complete example session with proper formatting using the working endpoints:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Set up authentication\nexport MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN=$(python3 -m mcpgateway.utils.create_jwt_token -u admin --secret my-test-key)\n\n# Function to make JSON-RPC calls via /rpc (for methods other than initialize)\nmake_rpc_call() {\n    curl -s -X POST -H \"Authorization: Bearer $MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN\" \\\n         -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n         -d \"$1\" \\\n         http://localhost:4444/rpc | jq\n}\n\n# Function to make protocol calls (for initialize)\nmake_protocol_call() {\n    curl -s -X POST -H \"Authorization: Bearer $MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN\" \\\n         -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n         -d \"$1\" \\\n         http://localhost:4444/protocol/initialize | jq\n}\n\n# 1. Initialize (using protocol endpoint to avoid bug)\necho \"=== Initializing ===\"\nmake_protocol_call '{\n  \"protocol_version\":\"2025-03-26\",\n  \"capabilities\":{},\n  \"client_info\":{\"name\":\"demo\",\"version\":\"0.0.1\"}\n}'\n\n# 2. Send initialized notification (optional for HTTP-based calls)\necho \"=== Sending initialized notification ===\"\nmake_rpc_call '{\n  \"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\n  \"method\":\"notifications/initialized\",\n  \"params\":{}\n}'\n\n# 3. List tools\necho \"=== Listing tools ===\"\nmake_rpc_call '{\n  \"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\n  \"id\":2,\n  \"method\":\"tools/list\"\n}'\n\n# 4. Call a tool (if available)\necho \"=== Calling tool ===\"\nmake_rpc_call '{\n  \"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\n  \"id\":3,\n  \"method\":\"tools/call\",\n  \"params\":{\n    \"name\":\"get_current_time\",\n    \"arguments\":{\"timezone\":\"Europe/Dublin\"}\n  }\n}'\n\n# 5. Ping test\necho \"=== Ping test ===\"\nmake_rpc_call '{\n  \"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\n  \"id\":4,\n  \"method\":\"ping\"\n}'\n```\n\n### Alternative: Complete SSE Session\n\nFor a more robust approach using SSE:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Set up authentication\nexport MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN=$(python3 -m mcpgateway.utils.create_jwt_token -u admin --secret my-test-key)\n\necho \"Starting SSE connection in background...\"\n# Start SSE connection in background\ncurl -N -H \"Authorization: Bearer $MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN\" \\\n     http://localhost:4444/sse &\nSSE_PID=$!\n\n# Give SSE time to connect\nsleep 2\n\n# Function to send messages via SSE\nsend_sse_message() {\n    curl -s -X POST -H \"Authorization: Bearer $MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN\" \\\n         -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n         -d \"$1\" \\\n         http://localhost:4444/message\n}\n\necho \"=== Sending initialize message ===\"\nsend_sse_message '{\n  \"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\n  \"id\":1,\n  \"method\":\"initialize\",\n  \"params\":{\n    \"protocolVersion\":\"2025-03-26\",\n    \"capabilities\":{},\n    \"clientInfo\":{\"name\":\"demo\",\"version\":\"0.0.1\"}\n  }\n}'\n\nsleep 1\n\necho \"=== Sending tools/list message ===\"\nsend_sse_message '{\n  \"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\n  \"id\":2,\n  \"method\":\"tools/list\"\n}'\n\nsleep 1\n\necho \"=== Sending tool call message ===\"\nsend_sse_message '{\n  \"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\n  \"id\":3,\n  \"method\":\"tools/call\",\n  \"params\":{\n    \"name\":\"get_current_time\",\n    \"arguments\":{\"timezone\":\"Europe/Dublin\"}\n  }\n}'\n\n# Clean up\nsleep 5\nkill $SSE_PID\n```\n\n## Integration with Claude Desktop\n\nTo use this with Claude Desktop, create a configuration that points to the STDIO wrapper:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"mcpgateway-wrapper\": {\n      \"command\": \"python3\",\n      \"args\": [\"-m\", \"mcpgateway.wrapper\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"MCP_AUTH_TOKEN\": \"<your-token>\",\n        \"MCP_SERVER_CATALOG_URLS\": \"http://localhost:4444/servers/1\",\n        \"MCP_TOOL_CALL_TIMEOUT\": \"120\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues\n\n1. **Authentication errors**: Ensure your bearer token is valid and not expired\n2. **Connection refused**: Check that the MCP Gateway server is running\n3. **Method not found**: Verify the method name and that required tools/resources are registered\n4. **Timeout errors**: Increase the timeout value for long-running tools\n5. **Protocol version mismatch**: Ensure you're using a supported protocol version\n\n### Known Issues\n\n#### Initialize Method Error: `'coroutine' object has no attribute 'model_dump'`\n\nIf you encounter this error when calling the `initialize` method via `/rpc`:\n\n```json\n{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"error\":{\"code\":-32000,\"message\":\"Internal error\",\"data\":\"'coroutine' object has no attribute 'model_dump'\"},\"id\":1}\n```\n\nThis is a bug in the `/rpc` endpoint's initialize handler where an async function is not being properly awaited.\n\n**Workaround 1: Use the dedicated protocol endpoint**\n\nInstead of using `/rpc`, use the `/protocol/initialize` endpoint:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST -H \"Authorization: Bearer $MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN\" \\\n     -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n     -d '{\n           \"protocol_version\":\"2025-03-26\",\n           \"capabilities\":{},\n           \"client_info\":{\"name\":\"demo\",\"version\":\"0.0.1\"}\n         }' \\\n     http://localhost:4444/protocol/initialize\n```\n\n**Workaround 2: Use Server-Sent Events (SSE)**\n\nUse the SSE-based approach which has proper async handling:\n\n```bash\n# Terminal 1: Establish SSE connection\ncurl -N -H \"Authorization: Bearer $MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN\" \\\n     http://localhost:4444/sse\n\n# Terminal 2: Send initialization message\ncurl -X POST -H \"Authorization: Bearer $MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN\" \\\n     -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n     -d '{\n           \"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\n           \"id\":1,\n           \"method\":\"initialize\",\n           \"params\":{\n             \"protocolVersion\":\"2025-03-26\",\n             \"capabilities\":{},\n             \"clientInfo\":{\"name\":\"demo\",\"version\":\"0.0.1\"}\n           }\n         }' \\\n     http://localhost:4444/message\n```\n\nThe SSE approach allows you to maintain a persistent connection and receive responses in real-time, which is closer to how MCP is intended to work.\n\n## Further Reading\n\n- [[MCP Specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)\n- [[JSON-RPC 2.0 Specification](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification)](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification)\n- [[MCP Gateway Documentation](https://ibm.github.io/mcp-context-forge/)](https://ibm.github.io/mcp-context-forge/)",

      "description" : "### Increasing access\n\nIn 2.0, we released p5.strands! Currently, the documentation is a little sparse, and you have to find either our one tutorial, or look at the examples on a base shader (e.g. baseMaterialShader.) The text of the referencedoesn't mention strands. If we can document p5.strands more like how we document regular p5 functions, more people can discover it, and learning how to use it will be more straightforward.\n\n### Most appropriate sub-area of p5.js?\n\n- [ ] Accessibility\n- [ ] Color\n- [ ] Core/Environment/Rendering\n- [ ] Data\n- [ ] DOM\n- [ ] Events\n- [ ] Image\n- [ ] IO\n- [ ] Math\n- [ ] Typography\n- [ ] Utilities\n- [x] WebGL\n- [ ] Build process\n- [ ] Unit testing\n- [ ] Internationalization\n- [ ] Friendly errors\n- [ ] Other (specify if possible)\n\n### Feature enhancement details\n\nA p5.strands snippet might look something like this:\n```js\nmyShader = baseMaterialShader().modify(() => {\n  let time = uniformFloat(() => millis());\n  getWorldInputs((inputs) => {\n    inputs.position.y +=\n      20 * sin(time * 0.001 + inputs.position.x * 0.05);\n    return inputs;\n  });\n});\n```\nThe `getWorldInputs` function is a **hook**. These hooks are currently only described on the reference for the base shaders that use them (e.g. https://beta.p5js.org/reference/p5/basematerialshader/), and are currently described in GLSL, as that was the only way to modify shaders at the time those docs were written.\n\nI'm proposing that we:\n- Create a new reference page for each hook function (e.g. `getObjectInputs`, `combineColors`, etc)\n  - Since these methods are dynamically created, the reference pages can be made by placing a doc comment block at the end of a file describing each method even though the method itself is not next to the comment block (similar to [how properties of classes are documented.](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/blob/9515a629fd6979a20e0988ff6bb4b1c96eef6b2d/src/webgl/p5.Framebuffer.js#L1837-L1889))\n  - Put these in a new p5.strands section or subsection of the reference by using `@module` (for section) and `@submodule` (for subsection) in the doc comments. Open to ideas about exactly where in the reference it should go!\n  - Describe **without GLSL** how to use the hook\n  - Create (or copy from the base shader) an example or two for each hook reference (e.g. for hooks coming from multiple shaders, maybe show an example of each?)\n  - Link back to all the base shader references that include it (e.g. `getObjectInputs` is on I think all of our base shaders)\n- Update the base shader docs to link to all the individual hook docs rather than describing them all in a table\n- Update the `shader.modify()` docs to mention p5.strands JS callbacks as well as the object-with-glsl option currently described\n\nWe don't have to do all of these in one go, I can make a subtasks for each if someone is interested in getting started on just a part of this \uD83D\uDE42 ",

Before I update all hooks, I want to confirm the documentation style and file location.\nI am creating the new reference documentation for p5.strands hooks in:\np5.js/src/webgl/p5.strands.js\nHere???s what I???m planning for each hook (example: getWorldInputs) :\n\n```\n/**\n * @method getWorldInputs\n * @param {Object} inputs An object containing:\n *   - `position`: [x, y, z], the position of the vertex in world space\n *   - `normal`: [x, y, z], the normal vector in world space\n *   - `texCoord`: [u, v], the texture coordinates\n *   - `color`: [r, g, b, a], the vertex color\n * @return {Object} The modified inputs object\n * @example\n * <div modernizr='webgl'>\n * <code>\n * let myShader;\n * function setup() {\n *   createCanvas(200, 200, WEBGL);\n *   myShader = baseMaterialShader().modify({\n *     uniforms: {\n *       'float time': () => millis()\n *     },\n *     'getWorldInputs': (inputs) => {\n *       inputs.position[1] += 20 * Math.sin(time * 0.001 + inputs.position[0] * 0.05);\n *       return inputs;\n *     }\n *   });\n * }\n * function draw() {\n *   background(255);\n *   shader(myShader);\n *   lights();\n *   noStroke();\n *   fill('red');\n *   sphere(50);\n * }\n * </code>\n * </div>\n */\n\n```\n\nCould you please confirm if this is the correct style, level of detail, and file location for the new p5.strands documentation?\nIf so, I???ll proceed with the rest in this format. Thanks!", "For location: we currently have the rest of the p5.strands implementation in `src/webgl/ShaderGenerator.js`, potentially we could add these doc comment blocks to the end of that file? Or @lukeplowden if you think that file is getting too busy, then splitting these out into a separate file like you describe works too.\n\nThe doc comment structure looks good in general! Some small modifications:\n- If you add `@for p5` then that tells the reference that this is a global function and not a class function\n- `getWorldInputs` itself actually has no return value, and takes in a single function as a parameter. That function is what needs to take in an object containing those properties, and return a modified object. Maybe take a look at the callbacks in loading methods like [`loadImage`](https://beta.p5js.org/reference/p5/loadimage/) for an example of how to do the type for that.\n  - For the properties on an input, @lukeplowden and @perminder-17  what do you think would be the best way to describe those? `[x, y, z]` sorta looks like you'd access it like an array (e.g. `position[0]`) rather than like an object (`position.x`), but describing it like `{ x, y, z }` might be syntactically confusing too. It's kind of like a `p5.Vector`, but also it isn't one. What do you think about describing it like \"an object with `x`, `y`, and `z` properties\"?\n  - If we do the above, we may need to replace the `u` and `v` for the texture coordinate property with `x` and `y`, since those are the names you'd have to access its values with\n- As a last thing, as part of the description, can we also list and link to the reference for the shaders that have that hook?\n\nEDIT: one other thought. Currently we still have the `@experimental` label on other strands-related things, so we maybe should add that to these too for consistency.", "Also if it helps, feel free to make a [draft PR](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/introducing-draft-pull-requests/) with just some of the changes if you want to get feedback before then doing all the rest.", "\nThank you for the detailed feedback @davepagurek ! \n\nI???ll create a draft PR with just a few of the updated doc comments (for example, getWorldInputs, combineColors, and getPointSize) so you can review the style, level of detail, and file location before I update the rest.\n\nAlso, is it required to use the full PR template (with checklist, screenshots, etc.) for a draft PR, or is a simpler description acceptable at this stage?

In my opinion, having troops cost money really slows gameplay down and discourages purchasing improvements.\n\nWhen purchasing troops to refill reserves, unlike the current behavior of gifting troops, you will receive a short burst of \"recruitment\", where population growth is increased but the new population will be troops. This quick burst tapers off in some sort of logarithmic fashion.\n\nThe larger the investment, the more aggressive your burst of reserves.\n\nThe above is just an idea and not the intended solution to this issue. However this can be something we can think about as a follow-up.\n\nI won't bog down this issue with meta and gameplay discussion just yet, let's just see how the game plays in testing with this defaulted distribution when everyone needs only to worry about troop count.", "I really think that adapting troops/worker ratio during a match is a crucial part of a player strategy . \nPlease dont remove it.\nIMHO it would be better to show a button to hide it + config hide / show by default, and keyboard shortcut (hide + adapt ratio)", " @dolie I agree, we definitely wont remove the ability for you to change the ratio, however we do want to make it easier for the majority of players who don't change it often, and to make it easier for mobile players to do the same as desktop players. As of right now, I have a solution that will toggle you between three different \"balances\".\n\nYou do make a good point, that removing a UI element, no matter how \"much\" we think is used, can be detrimental. \n\nI'll look to add an option in user settings (defaulted off) that will toggle the slider's visibility, so that those that do wish to min-max their ratios, can do so.", "Worker/troop trade-off feels like a good idea, but the UI slider feels like a bad UI for it: the percentage is rarely the immediate thing users care about. With the current mechanics it feels like the controls should be a list of options: optimize for money with minimal troop count compared to neighbors, optimize for defence, optimize for offence, etc." ],

This will cause me to send the problem directly after pasting. But in fact, I didn't finish writing. But when I stopped by esc, I tried to retrieve the previous conversation, but it disappeared, and I could never complete the pasting operation.\n\nAnother way is to copy and paste it into an unformatted part first, such as WIN+R to run the input box before copying and pasting it into cli. I think this is a very big problem and seriously affects development efficiency.\n\nI wonder if the last space can be automatically cleaned when pasting to prevent sending messages before editing is completed.\n\nNow as long as it involves me entering some text, and then I try to combine errors in multiple locations to ask questions. It can't be completed at all. I tried \\ enter shift, but it didn't work.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

Just keep a scratchpad file open in the same folder so that Gemini can access it. Then you can paste there anything, without worrying. Gemini then shall read it via `read_file` when you tell her to do so. Just keep that TXT file open in another window: `gedit`, `notepad` etc. one.  \nB.

      "description" : "### Discussed in https://github.com/airtai/faststream/discussions/1570\r\n\r\n<div type='discussions-op-text'>\r\n\r\n<sup>Originally posted by **gri38** July  1, 2024</sup>\r\nHello.\r\n\r\nWhen we subscribe to a queue to answer a RPC call, it seems we cannot document the return type.\r\n\r\nH??ere a small exemple:\r\n```python\r\nimport logging\r\n\r\nfrom faststream import FastStream\r\nfrom faststream.rabbit import RabbitBroker\r\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, conint\r\n\r\nbroker = RabbitBroker()\r\napp = FastStream(broker)\r\n\r\n\r\nclass In(BaseModel):\r\n    i: str\r\n    j: conint(gt=0)\r\n\r\nclass Out(BaseModel):\r\n    k: str\r\n    l: float\r\n\r\n\r\n@broker.subscriber(\"RPC\",\r\n                   title=\"RPC\",\r\n                   description=\"This queue is used to for RPC\",\r\n\r\n                   )\r\nasync def rpc_handler(input: In) -> Out:\r\n    logging.info(f\"{input=}\")\r\n    return Out(k=input.i, l=input.j)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I run with `faststream docs serve rpc:app` I cannot see Out in the doc (http://localhost:8000).\r\n\r\nIs there a way to do so ?\r\n\r\nWhen I use the RabbitRouter, I can see in the router @subscriber decorator: \r\n```python\r\n# FastAPI args\r\n        response_model: Annotated[\r\n            Any,\r\n            Doc(\r\n                \"\"\"\r\n                The type to use for the response.\r\n\r\n                It could be any valid Pydantic *field* type. So, it doesn't have to\r\n                be a Pydantic model, it could be other things, like a `list`, `dict`,\r\n                etc.\r\n\r\n                It will be used for:\r\n\r\n                * Documentation: the generated OpenAPI (and the UI at `/docs`) will\r\n                    show it as the response (JSON Schema).\r\n                * Serialization: you could return an arbitrary object and the\r\n                    `response_model` would be used to serialize that object into the\r\n                    corresponding JSON.\r\n                * Filtering: the JSON sent to the client will only contain the data\r\n                    (fields) defined in the `response_model`. If you returned an object\r\n                    that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does\r\n                    not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have\r\n                    that `password`.\r\n                * Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the\r\n                    `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the\r\n                    corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not\r\n                    valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,\r\n                    so it's an error from the API developer. So, FastAPI will raise an\r\n                    error and return a 500 error code (Internal Server Error).\r\n\r\n                Read more about it in the\r\n                [FastAPI docs for Response Model](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/).\r\n                \"\"\"\r\n            ),\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut even with response_model: nothing in asyncAPI.\r\n\r\nThanks for any tips, even for \"it's not possible\" ;-)\r\n\r\n</div>",

I have a request/suggestion related to the recently introduced (https://github.com/domferr/tilingshell/issues/169) auto tiling.\r\n\r\nMost of the time auto tiling is what I want out of my window manager, but depending on what I'm working on I sometimes don't want it. My specific use case is that I am developing a desktop application that closes and re-spawns its main window as I make changes in the source code and it is helpful if the application window always spawns into the same position and size every time (based on the configuration in my code).\r\n\r\nI find myself manually going into the `tiling-shell` extension settings to toggle \"auto tiling\" off while I'm working on my desktop application, and then going back in and toggling \"auto tiling\" back on when I am using my computer for non-development work.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if I could just hit a configurable keybind rather than having to open up the gnome extension settings to toggle this setting.\r\n\r\nThanks for considering, cheers!",

It would help to automate this during the website build process.\n\nThe idea here is:\n* add templating support to the website resources, so that the build would interpret templating instructions, not only variable references supported by the resources plugin\n* replace references to specific GlassFish versions with variables\n* redefine a variable with a specific version before each block and then reuse it in the whole block\n\nFor example, with velocity engine, it could look like:\n\n```\n#set($version = \"7.0.24\")\n\nGlassFish version $version brings new features...\n\nDownload at https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/ee4j/glassfish/glassfish-$version.zip\n\n#set($version = \"7.0.23\")\n\nGlassFish version $version brings new features...\n\nDownload at https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/ee4j/glassfish/glassfish-$version.zip\n\n```\n\nPossible options:\n\n* replace the standard maven resources plugin with an existing maven plugin that supports templating, e.g. [MojoHaus Templating Maven Plugin](https://www.mojohaus.org/templating-maven-plugin/)\n* create a [custom resource filter](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-resources-plugin/examples/custom-resource-filters.html) for the resources plugin that calls velocity or some other templating engine - no such custom resource exists out of the box, we would have to create one and wrap a templating engine\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nHappens everytime we update the glassfish.org website after a new GlassFish release.\n\n### Impact of Issue\n\n_No response_",

If you'd like to try it, I can mentor you a bit. But if you don't like tinkering with the build and Maven, maybe there's a better issue for you to pick up.\n\nIn any case, the best thing to do for a start is building GlassFish itself. You can find some help about it in the build section of the [README file](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish?tab=readme-ov-file#building)\n\nThen, if you decided to investigate this issue, it's good to start with building the website locally. There's no documentation for this I think, I should write something about it. Right now, I can share my script that I execute to run a preview of the page locally. I use this script on Ubuntu Linux with zsh shell:\n\n```\nGLASSFISH_REPO=../glassfish\nGF_DOCS_DIR=\"$GLASSFISH_REPO\"/docs/publish/target/staging\n\n# Build all docs artifacts (PDFs and HTML)\n#mvn -f \"$GLASSFISH_REPO\"/docs/pom.xml -T4C clean install\n\nmvn -f \"$GLASSFISH_REPO\"/docs/pom.xml -T4C -pl website,distribution -Ppublish-site clean install\nmvn -f \"$GLASSFISH_REPO\"/docs/publish/pom.xml clean install\n\n\necho \"source 'https://rubygems.org'\ngem 'github-pages', group: :jekyll_plugins\ngem 'jekyll-theme-eclipsefdn'\ngem 'webrick'\ngem 'jekyll-toc'\n\" > \"$GF_DOCS_DIR\"/Gemfile\n\nsed -i 's!remote_theme: eclipsefdn/jekyll-theme-eclipsefdn!theme: jekyll-theme-eclipsefdn!' \"$GF_DOCS_DIR\"/_config.yml\n\ngrep repository \"$GF_DOCS_DIR\"/_config.yml > /dev/null || echo '\\nrepository: eclipse-ee4j/glassfish' >> \"$GF_DOCS_DIR\"/_config.yml\n\nbundle install --gemfile \"$GF_DOCS_DIR\"/Gemfile\n\nzsh -c \"cd $GF_DOCS_DIR; bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental\"\n# run `bundle exec jekyll serve` in GF_DOCS_DIR   \n```\n\nInstead of zsh you can use bash, or just type the `cd $GF_DOCS_DIR; bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental` command in the terminal manually.

I disabled Windows search indexing on my Nextcloud directory because windows kept on downloading files I wanted to only keep online every time I searched for something in the parent folder.\n\nThe search function in the Nextcloud tray menu is able to find the desired sub folder, but clicking the folder only opens the containing folder and not the folder itself. This is useless to me because, as said, there are a lot of different folders and the folder names are too similar.\n\nIt looks like Nextcloud just opens the containing folder for folders or files. It would be nice if there was at least a context open to allow opening folder or files.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nOpen folder or file by default and have open containing folder the context menu option, but that risks messing with other people's workflow since open containing folder is the current behavior.",

We want to open \".../folder/subfolder\" directly in our file explorer, but when searching for it in the traymenu search bar and clicking on \"subfolder\" the containing folder \".../folder\" opens. \nFrom the implementation it seems to me as if this was indeed intended by the deliberate use of `QFileInfo(relativePath).path()` instead of simply `relativePath` as an argument to `findFileInLocalFolders` when initializing `localFiles` in _src/gui/tray/unifiedsearchresultlistmodel.cpp_ line 340. \nHowever in the web browser the clicked folder or file is directly opened, rather than the containing folder (currently the case for server versions above 20)\n\nI ask because I am currently working on a fix for this alongside mike and in case the behavior where the containing folder is opened is the desired standard behavior then we would try to implement the behavior requested by OP as a selectable option. Otherwise we would simply make it the default behavior and fix the web browser bug for versions above 20. " ],

I am open to anyone who wants to contribute! Feel free to comment here and I'll provide full support!", "Hey @domferr, I'd like to start working on this feature and it would be great to have a feedback from early ideas and potential implementation.\n\nBy the way I've never use TypeScript/JavaScript, but I did a lot of C/C++/Python/Rust so even if I'm ok doing this, feel free to make any comments as there may be some TypeScript-specific concepts I'm not aware of !\n\n### UI side\n\nI was thinking about:\n\n- adding a toggle between `Width` and `Border color` called `Automatic border color`\n- renaming `Border color` to `Custom border color`\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a02259c-e745-4640-8494-03849352e624)\n\nThe extension would then automatically synchronize the color with the global accent color when the toggle is activated, or use the custom border color when deactivated.\n\n### Backend side\n\nSome settings would be added/modified:\n\n- add a new setting called `WINDOW_BORDER_COLOR_AUTO` (or some other variant name if you prefer) that would hold the toggle state and would be register in the gschema\n- rename `WINDOW_BORDER_COLOR` to `WINDOW_BORDER_COLOR_CUSTOM`\n- add a new setting called `WINDOW_BORDER_COLOR` that would return `WINDOW_BORDER_COLOR_CUSTOM` or the global accent color based on `WINDOW_BORDER_COLOR_AUTO` state\n\nHere I differenciate the general color from the custom color, so the previously user-defined color isn't overwritten when auto coloring is used.\n\nLooking at [GNOME-Auto-Accent-Color implementation](https://github.com/Wartybix/GNOME-Auto-Accent-Colour/blob/10ee080c75be09038c2d13f635b75ae9e93f81e5/extension.js#L356), it looks like it's a simple call to `Gio.Settings({ schema: INTERFACE_SCHEMA }).get_string(ACCENT_COLOR)`.\nPlus some [signal management](https://github.com/Wartybix/GNOME-Auto-Accent-Colour/blob/10ee080c75be09038c2d13f635b75ae9e93f81e5/extension.js#L529) when the accent color is changed after startup.\n\nWhat do you think about this ?", "Hey, first of all, thank you so much! \n\nYour idea of changing the current WINDOW_BORDER_COLOR to return WINDOW_BORDER_COLOR_CUSTOM or the global accent color based on WINDOW_BORDER_COLOR_AUTO state is a cool idea!\n\n## How Tiling Shell stores the window border color setting\n\nWhat you see in the preferences window is a pair, the setting key and its value. The key is stored in [`Settings.KEY_WINDOW_BORDER_COLOR`](https://github.com/domferr/tilingshell/blob/c12f6eecde7279aed0bf5dd8e3631c2551afe068/src/settings/settings.ts#L81). It must match with the key specified in Tiling Shell gschema [here](https://github.com/domferr/tilingshell/blob/c12f6eecde7279aed0bf5dd8e3631c2551afe068/resources/schemas/org.gnome.shell.extensions.tilingshell.gschema.xml#L135).\n\nTo add a new setting (for example the boolean you called `WINDOW_BORDER_COLOR_AUTO`) you can follow the guide I wrote [here](https://github.com/domferr/tilingshell/blob/main/README.md#how-to-add-new-keybindings) but just the steps 1 and 2.\n\n## How Tiling Shell shows the window border color\n\nThe management of window border is in [`WindowBorderManager`](https://github.com/domferr/tilingshell/blob/c12f6eecde7279aed0bf5dd8e3631c2551afe068/src/components/windowBorderManager.ts#L382) class. [Here](https://github.com/domferr/tilingshell/blob/c12f6eecde7279aed0bf5dd8e3631c2551afe068/src/components/windowBorderManager.ts#L350) is where I set the border color according to the user setting. The class `Settings` has the goal to make extremely easy (like one line of code) to get and set the settings and listen to the user changes of the setting. It exposes a static field for each setting and its getter and setter (like [here](https://github.com/domferr/tilingshell/blob/c12f6eecde7279aed0bf5dd8e3631c2551afe068/src/settings/settings.ts#L361-L367)) gets/sets the value from/to Gio.Settings.\n\n## GNOME's accent color setting\n\nFrom your link, then, I can say that it looks like GNOME 47+ stores the accent color to the schema `org.gnome.desktop.interface`, with key `accent-color`. I don't have GNOME 47 so it might be worth to double check if you can! (using tools like dconf or getting the key value from terminal, let me know if you need help on this)\n\n## Signal management: listen to `accent-color` changes\n\nHaving that association there is awesome! In Tiling Shell there is already another example of signal management to listen to changes of `Gio.Settings` keys, have a look [here](https://github.com/domferr/tilingshell/blob/c12f6eecde7279aed0bf5dd8e3631c2551afe068/src/extension.ts#L170C9-L173)! Something like this then:\n\n```\nthis._signals.connect(\n            new Gio.Settings({ schema: 'org.gnome.desktop.interface' }),\n            'changed::accent-color',\n            (_interfaceSettings: Gio.Settings) => {\n                    ... this code here is executed when the accent-color key changes its value\n            }\n);\n```\n\n`_signals` is an object of class [`SignalHandling`](https://github.com/domferr/tilingshell/blob/main/src/utils/signalHandling.ts#L7) which I created to have a class that simplifies connecting and disconnecting to signals. You can find it already used in WindowBorderManager class.\n\n## Add a new setting in the preferences\n\nAll the code of the preferences window is in `src/prefs.ts` file.\n\n## How to react to the user enabling or disabling the use of the accent color\n\nYou need to listen via signals to changes in the settings. [Here](https://github.com/domferr/tilingshell/blob/c12f6eecde7279aed0bf5dd8e3631c2551afe068/src/components/windowBorderManager.ts#L415-L417) for example, I listen to changes the user makes to the window border color setting (e.g. from the preferences window).\n```\nthis._signals.connect(Settings, Settings.KEY_WINDOW_BORDER_COLOR, () =>\n            this._border?.updateStyle(),\n);\n```\nIn the code above I listen to changes in the Settings (e.g. changes made from Tiling Shell's preferences window). Specifically, I listen to changes of the key `KEY_WINDOW_BORDER_COLOR`. If it changes then the following function is run \n```\n() =>\n            this._border?.updateStyle(),\n)\n```\n(this is similar to C++ lambda functions!)\nYou can do a similar thing but with something like `KEY_WINDOW_BORDER_COLOR_AUTO`.", "To simplify, I can think of those steps:\n1. Add in Tiling Shell's gschema a new setting with key `window-border-color-auto` which value is a boolean and default value is false\n2. Update class Settings to introduce KEY_WINDOW_BORDER_COLOR_AUTO and getter/setter of WINDOW_BORDER_COLOR_AUTO. This returns/sets a boolean, which defaults to false in case of any error. You can follow other boolean settings in the Settings class\n3. Listen to KEY_WINDOW_BORDER_COLOR_AUTO changes in WindowBorderManager class (like we listen to changes of KEY_WINDOW_BORDER_COLOR)\n4. In WindowBorderManager class, listen to GNOME's `accent-color` changes to update the style of the border (like we listen to changes of KEY_WINDOW_BORDER_COLOR)\n5. Update `src/prefs.ts` file to add a new row in the preferences window to with your new flag `Automatic border color`\n\nReach me out for anything you may need! Feel free to open a pull request whenever you want", "Thanks for all the indications, they are really valuable and I truly appreciate them !\n\nThis doesn't seem too difficult so I think I'll come back in a few days/weeks with a working solution in a PR. \uD83D\uDE04 ", "Hey @vinchatl did you manage to implement this? I'd love to give this update to everybody, let me know if you are working on it so I don't begin the development myself \uD83D\uDE0E " ],

      "repositoryName" : "opensource-society/CodeClip",
      "description" : "Issue Description:\n\n **Problem**\nThe CodeClip application currently has a polished landing page but suffers from completely non-functional navigation. All header navigation links (`Home`, `Challenges`, `Editor`, `Profile`) point to `#` placeholders, and the main CTA buttons link to non-existent routes (`/coding`, `/challenges`). This makes the application unusable beyond the landing page and creates a poor user experience.\n\n### Current Issues\n- ??? Navigation links in header are dummy links (`href=\"#\"`)\n- ??? CTA buttons point to `/coding` and `/challenges` routes that don't exist\n- ??? No routing system implemented to handle page navigation\n- ??? Users cannot access any functionality beyond the homepage\n\n### Proposed Solution\nImplement a basic client-side routing system and create the essential pages:\n\n1. **Fix Navigation Links**\n   - Update header navigation to point to actual pages/routes\n   - Ensure CTA buttons lead to functional destinations\n\n2. **Create Missing Essential Pages**\n   - `pages/challenges.html` - Basic challenge listing page\n   - `pages/profile.html` - User profile/progress page  \n   - Enhance existing editor.html with proper structure\n\n3. **Implement Basic Routing**\n   - Add simple client-side routing logic in app.js\n   - Handle page navigation without full page reloads\n   - Maintain consistent header/footer across pages\n\nThis issue focuses on making the basic navigation functional, which is essential before implementing more advanced features like challenge data, code execution, or user progress tracking.\n\nPlease assign me this part\nThank you!",

Add support for tags in the import API endpoint\nFor client changes,\n  1. Update ImportActivitiesDialog to fetch available tags\n  2. Add UI for selecting/mapping tags in the import workflow (similar to account handling)\n  3. Add tag parsing to ImportActivitiesService for CSV/JSON imports\n  4. Update template to include tag selector component in the import dialog \n\nThe implementation would mirror how account handling works in the current import flow.

The idea is to handle the tag processing entirely on the backend, similar to how it's currently done for accounts during import.

Could you provide guidance on where I should look for the relevant logic? (e.g., which file or class deals with tab key handling or keyboard navigation?)\n   \n2. **Implementing the tab key behavior**:\n   - Once I locate the correct file, where would it be best to add the logic that moves focus to the next tab when pressing `Tab` in the last field of a tab? Should this be handled as part of an existing focus traversal policy, or would I need to implement a custom listener?\n\nAny pointers or advice on these two points would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThank you for your help.", "We do not know. Create a minimal JavaFX application with two tabs and check how it works there. Then port this knowledge to JabRef.", "### JavaFX Key Handling and Focus Issue\n\nHello,\n\nAfter exploring the codebase, I???ve learned how to check if a `TextField` in a `Tab` is the last one, and how to shift the focus to the next tab. However, I???ve encountered an issue with how JavaFX handles key events when a `TextField` is focused.\n\nFor example, if I create a listener for a `TextField` or even the `EntryEditor`, the listener won't execute while the `TextField` is in focus, as the `TextField` consumes the input before it reaches the listener/handler. This issue is currently evident with the `setupKeyBindings` function, which is intended to initialize shortcuts for navigating the entry editor. Only the \"Ctrl + MINUS\" key seems to work due to what I think is JavaFX handling key inputs before `setupKeyBindings` can.\n\nI???ve tried using `addEventFilter` instead of `addEventHandler`, but the result is the same. I???ve also explored using JavaFX???s `tabIndex` and focus priority logic to control the order of focus between tabs and fields. So that pressing \"tab\" will cycle through all of the specified components in order. However, since the `Tab` class doesn???t have built-in `tabIndex` or `focusTraversal` properties, this has proven to be quite a challenge.\n\nI???m unsure how to proceed or where I should be focusing my efforts. Any suggestions or guidance would be greatly appreciated thankyou.\n", "> I???m unsure how to proceed or where I should be focusing my efforts. Any suggestions or guidance would be greatly appreciated thankyou.\n\n1. Create a minimal JavaFX application showing the issue. Even smaller application than https://github.com/Siedlerchr/javafxreproducer.\n2. Publish the JavaFX application in a repository on GitHub.\n3. Ask question on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).\n4. Post the link to the stackoverflow question here.\n\n---\n\nYour text did not include a link to `org.jabref.gui.fieldeditors.FieldEditorFX#establishBinding`. Did you see this method? \n\n\n```java\n    if (keyBindingRepository.matches(e, {key-for-TAB})) {\n```\n\nWe have no key binding configuration for tab-to-next field. Which is OK. Just hard-code TAB.", "> Your text did not include a link to `org.jabref.gui.fieldeditors.FieldEditorFX#establishBinding`. Did you see this method?\n\nAh! Good to know. I implemented this feature by setting up a method in ` FieldEditorFX`  that moves the `TabPane` to the next tab if the user presses \"Tab\" while in the last `TextField` of the current tab. I created a method in `EntryEditor` that checks if the current `TextField` in focus is the last one by comparing its ID with the `Tab`'s  last `Field`'s name. Previously, each `TextField` didn???t have an ID set, so I updated this by setting each ID to the name of its original `Field`.\n\n**Reasons for this approach:**\n1. **EntryEditor context requirement:** We can't directly check if the current `Field` in focus is the last without `EntryEditor` context. Because of the way `TextFields` are created, we can???t directly locate the last `TextField` of a `Tab`, but we can easily identify the last `Field` in a tab. To bridge this gap, I assigned IDs to each `TextField` based on their original `Field` names, allowing for comparison.\n2. **Adheres to Field creation policy:** This approach adapts to changes in the last `TextField` depending on the active `Tab`, as all `TextFields` are initially created as `Fields`. Because each `TextField` is linked to a corresponding `Field` (with its ID matching the field's name), and the last field in a tab can always be identified through the `shownFields` method, all `TextField`s can be checked as the last `TextField`.\n\n**Alternative approach:** Another way to address this issue could be to modify the focus traversal list, so pressing \"Tab\" while a `TextField` is in focus cycles through the fields until reaching the last one, then moves to the next `Tab`. However, after spending a short while exploring this option it shows its challenges.\n\nIf you???re happy with this implementation, I can create a PR for you to review.

      "description" : "**Describe the bug**\nThe Person struct, which is used for handling user data, is defined directly within the CreateUserHandler function. This approach restricts its scope and reusability, making the code less modular and harder to maintain if the same Person structure needs to be used elsewhere (e.g., in other handlers, for database operations, or for data serialization/deserialization). It's a code organization and best practice issue rather than a runtime crash.\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior, if applicable:\nSteps to reproduce the behavior, if applicable:\n\nThe code in question is found in the CreateUserHandler function, specifically:\n\nGo\n\nfunc CreateUserHandler(ctx gofr.Context) (interface{}, error) {\n    // Create a person document\n    type Person struct {\n        Name string `json:\"name\"`\n        Age  int    `json:\"age\"`\n    }\n    // ... rest of the handler logic\n}\nThere is no runtime error generated by this specific bug; it's a structural issue. However, if you attempt to use the Person struct outside of this function, it will result in a compilation error:\n\nundefined: Person\n\n**Expected behavior**\nThe Person struct should be defined at a package level (e.g., in main.go or a dedicated models.go file within the package). This makes it accessible and reusable across different functions and files in the package, leading to cleaner, more maintainable, and less redundant code.\n\nfor example\nGo\n\npackage main\n\n// Person struct defined at package level\ntype Person struct {\n    Name string `json:\"name\"`\n    Age  int    `json:\"age\"`\n}\n\nfunc CreateUserHandler(ctx gofr.Context) (interface{}, error) {\n    var p Person // Use the package-level struct\n    // ... rest of the handler logic\n}\n\n**Screenshots**\n<img width=\"1917\" height=\"967\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72a31af9-6eff-44bb-a971-18d09616f7d0\" />\n\n**Environments **\n -OS: Linux (or any OS)\n- gofr version [v1.5.0]\n- go version [1.21]\n\n**More description**\nDefining structs at the package level is a standard Go best practice for data structures that represent domain entities or are used in multiple contexts.

Example zemax file: [Venus Laowa 10-18mm f4.5-5.6 Zoom.zmx](https://github.com/amegahed/OpticsDatabase/blob/main/Optics/Photography/Venus%20Laowa/Venus%20Laowa%2010-18mm%20f4.5-5.6%20Zoom.zmx)\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n1. Download Zemax file: [Venus Laowa 10-18mm f4.5-5.6 Zoom.zmx](https://github.com/amegahed/OpticsDatabase/blob/main/Optics/Photography/Venus%20Laowa/Venus%20Laowa%2010-18mm%20f4.5-5.6%20Zoom.zmx)\n2. Python code: `lens = load_zemax_file(ZMX_FILE)`\n3. Error: \n```\nraise ValueError('Aperture type must be \"EPD\", \"imageFNO\", '\n                     '\"objectNA\"')\nValueError: Aperture type must be \"EPD\", \"imageFNO\", \"objectNA\"\n```\n\n**Expected behavior**\nLoad zemax file without errors. The code seems to handle this case in `zemax_handler.py`:\n```\ndef _read_floating_stop(self, data):\n        \"\"\"\n        Extracts the floating stop data.\n\n        Args:\n            data (list): List of data values extracted from the Zemax file.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.data['aperture']['floating_stop'] = True\n```\nThough there is a limitation in `aperture.py`:\n```\ndef __init__(self, aperture_type, value, object_space_telecentric=False):\n        if aperture_type not in ['EPD', 'imageFNO', 'objectNA']:\n            raise ValueError('Aperture type must be \"EPD\", \"imageFNO\", '\n                             '\"objectNA\"')\n```\n\n\n**Screenshots**\nIf applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.\n\n\n**Environment**  \n- Optiland Version: `0.3.0`\n- Python Version: `3.13.3`\n- OS: `[Windows]`\n- Additional Info:\n\n\n**Additional context**\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\n",

      "repositoryName" : "HarrisonKramer/optiland",
      "description" : "Most use of `matplotlib` througout the package rely on the implicit `pyplot` API.\n\nI'd advocate for using the more explicit OOP-oriented API since it is considered cleaner, more pythonic, and allows for more control over plots.\n\nThe difference between the 2 APIs is described here :  https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/figure/api_interfaces.html\n\n## Example for distributions\n\nFor example, in the base class for distributions, the `view` method : \n\nhttps://github.com/HarrisonKramer/optiland/blob/6530b818bdac359858bcd0368fa950e5c53b7476/optiland/distribution.py#L58\n\nuses `plt` for accessing `matplotlib`. This code could be replace with, for example : \n\n**Before**\n\n```python\n    def view(self):\n        \"\"\"Visualize the distribution.\n\n        This method plots the distribution points and a unit circle for\n            reference.\n        \"\"\"\n        plt.plot(self.x, self.y, \"k*\")\n        t = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 256)\n        x, y = np.cos(t), np.sin(t)\n        plt.plot(x, y, \"r\")\n        plt.xlabel(\"Normalized Pupil Coordinate X\")\n        plt.ylabel(\"Normalized Pupil Coordinate Y\")\n        plt.axis(\"equal\")\n        plt.show()\n```\n\n**After**\n```python\n    def view(self, ax=None):\n        \"\"\"Visualize the distribution.\n    \n        This method plots the distribution points and a unit circle for\n            reference.\n        \"\"\"\n        if ax is None:\n            fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n        \n        ax.plot(self.x, self.y, \"k*\")\n        t = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 256)\n        x, y = np.cos(t), np.sin(t)\n        ax.plot(x, y, \"r\")\n        ax.set_xlabel(\"Normalized Pupil Coordinate X\")\n        ax.set_ylabel(\"Normalized Pupil Coordinate Y\")\n        ax.set_aspect(\"equal\")\n        return ax\n```\n\nThis way :\n- the user can either provide the `Axes` or let the method just create a new one with signature `(self, ax=None): `\n- and return the `Axes` for further customization with `return ax` \n- and delay the actual displaying by removing `plt.show()`\n\n## Generalization\n\nThis approach could (and should?) be applied throughout all plottings with `matplotlib` in the package:\n - https://github.com/HarrisonKramer/optiland/blob/4000c03774e889cba85599c71669b2bba9d037d1/optiland/visualization/visualization.py#L48\n - https://github.com/HarrisonKramer/optiland/blob/6530b818bdac359858bcd0368fa950e5c53b7476/optiland/psf.py#L107\n - https://github.com/HarrisonKramer/optiland/blob/6530b818bdac359858bcd0368fa950e5c53b7476/optiland/wavefront.py#L421\n\n## Note on circles\n\nI believe using \n```python\ncircle = plt.Circle((xc, yc), R, fill=False)\nax.add_patch(circle)\n```\nis considered a cleaner approach to plot a circle on an ax (removes the need for sampling `t = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 256)' )",

There are still many functions using `matplotlib` with a call to `show()` in the package. I suppose the easiest way to find them will be to search for \"`plt.show()`\". Ultimately, all of these will likely need to be changed, though there could be exceptions. If you prefer not to update everything at once, you can focus on one or more modules at a time.\n\nBest,\nKramer", "Hi @HarrisonKramer, \nThanks, for the quick answer !\nI started with two files : `spot_diagram.py` and `ray_fan.py`, by removing the `plt.plot()` and returning the `fig, ax` objects. In interactive python/Jupyter, the figure behavior remains unchanged. However, in scripts, nothing will be displayed unless the returned figure is explicitly shown or saved.Let me know if there's anything I should consider before proceeding with the rest. \n[https://github.com/lordpositron/optiland/commit/78c05f130f5884934e1d09dc747a1c96c5dc9914](url)\n\nCorentin", "Hi @lordpositron,\n\nThanks for the quick update. I glanced at your update and it looks good. The only thing that may be missing is adding a new argument `ax=None` to the view functions, but this currently conflicts with some of the GUI logic, so I propose we don't change that yet. I spoke with @manuelFragata, who will investigate that further. For now, returning the the `fig` and `ax` should be sufficient.\n\nThanks,\nKramer\n" ],

Something to note is that the language server correctly picks up on most `p5` types. For instance when an image is loaded with `loadImage()` and stored into a variable, it implicitly has a type of `p5.Image`. However `createCapture()` is given an implicit type of `any`, so the `videoFeed` variable above is also of type `any`. Additionally when I hover over the import line: `import P5 from \"p5\";` I get the following message:\n```\nCould not find a declaration file for module 'p5'. '/Users/lukejans/Code/testing/p5-issue/node_modules/.pnpm/p5@2.0.3/node_modules/p5/dist/app.js' implicitly has an 'any' type.\nThere are types at '/Users/lukejans/Code/testing/p5-issue/node_modules/p5/types/p5.d.ts', but this result could not be resolved when respecting package.json \"exports\". The 'p5' library may need to update its package.json or typings. (ts 7016)\n```\nSo when I explicitly set the type in a JSDoc comment I get a language server hint that `P5.MediaElement` cannot be resolved.\n\n### Potentially Related Code\n\nhttps://github.com/processing/p5.js/blob/746a481a059152a7755423589a7860f4f1e0dcdc/src/dom/p5.MediaElement.js#L787-L790",

Poor contrast can reduce readability and negatively impact the overall user experience, especially for users with visual impairments.

You're running _Linux_ inside _Windows_, so the only reasonable options to display here, in my opinion, is either of those (instead of \"WSL\" / \"Docker\", ...).\n\nBut since you're not the first person bringing this up and since it's a small and not very much impactful change, I'll add it as change request nevertheless.", "Sure, here is some surveys\n\n[Stackoverflow 2024](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology#1-operating-system)\n[Stackoverflow 2023](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#section-most-popular-technologies-operating-system)\n\nI also regenerated my summaries today (before your message) and older Linux data became WSL. but new datas are considered as Linux again.\nI tried regenerate again but there is no change.\n\n<img width=\"739\" height=\"326\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/431e6851-3bbc-4e27-9390-97f8ed144b9b\" />\n\nAlso a lot of \"unknown\" labeled data instead of \"coding\" but clearly they are came from VsCode extension and has coding related info such as branch or etc whilte category field is empty. But it is not related with WSL.", "Hm maybe WSL showed in above picture because I clicked import data in integration tab for wakatime. I will check again after my 24 hour waiting time complete\n\nEdit: Yes above WSL data comes from Wakatime Integration. When I click import data and regenerate data form danger zone, it syncs like that.\n\nSo there is no Wakapi support for WSL but it reads Wakatime WSL data as WSL as well instead of changing to Linux.", "Will add WSL support for Wakapi \uD83D\uDC4D.\n\n> Also a lot of \"unknown\" labeled data instead of \"coding\" but clearly they are came from VsCode extension\n\nCan you possibly help me debug this by searching your database's `heartbeats` table for entries that correspond to coding time that is listed with unknown category and post a few (anonymized) examples here? That would be super helpful! But no worries if not.", "Thanks for your attention \uD83D\uDE4F\uD83C\uDFFB \n\nSure, here is my example json data.\n\n```json\n{\n      \"id\": \"10270276195\",\n      \"branch\": \"feature/xxx\",\n      \"category\": \"\",\n      \"entity\": \"/home/x/projects/x/components/pages/...tsx\",\n      \"is_write\": false,\n      \"language\": \"TSX\",\n      \"project\": \"x-web-app\",\n      \"time\": 1753564736,\n      \"type\": \"file\",\n      \"user_id\": \"Muo\",\n      \"machine_name_id\": \"muo-matebook\",\n      \"user_agent_id\": \"wakatime/v1.124.1 (linux-6.6.87.2-microsoft-standard-WSL2-x86_64) go1.24.4 cursor/1.99.3 vscode-wakatime/25.2.0\",\n      \"lines\": 62,\n      \"lineno\": 36,\n      \"cursorpos\": 15,\n      \"line_deletions\": 0,\n      \"line_additions\": 0,\n      \"created_at\": \"2025-07-26T23:18:58.65+02:00\"\n    },\n```\n\nAnd all my current datas are like that. I am using Wakapi for 3-5 days and first day datas were labelled correctly and they had correct category info. But last ones has no category info. Empty string. But clearly it should be \"coding\".\n\nI updated some settings for example Heartbeats Timeout and tried some logics and regenrated my datas several times. Maybe it is the root cause.\n\nSince I have also integration with Wakatime, they showing those datas are \"coding\" even category is empty. I think empty categories should be considered as \"coding\" if other values are related with coding." ],

Configure the MongoDB receiver with mongodb.flushes.rate metric disabled:\n  receivers:\n    mongodb:\n      metrics:\n        mongodb.flushes.rate:\n          enabled: false\n  2. Run the collector against a MongoDB instance that doesn't expose WiredTiger checkpoint statistics\n  3. Observe the collector logs\n## Expected Result\nWhen mongodb.flushes.rate is disabled, the receiver should:\n  - Skip data collection entirely for this metric\n  - Not attempt to access the wiredTiger.checkpoint.total succeed number of checkpoints path\n  - Not report any errors related to this metric \n## Actual Result\n The receiver reports the following error even though the metric is disabled:\n  error scraperhelper@v0.124.0/obs_metrics.go:61 Error scraping metrics {\"error\": \"failed to collect metric mongodb.flushes.rate: could not find key for metric\"}\n\n  The error occurs because:\n  1. recordFlushesPerSecond is called unconditionally in scraper.go:267\n  2. The function attempts to collect data using collectMetric(doc, metricPath) at metrics.go:323\n  3. When the required key is not found, it adds the error to scrapererror.ScrapeErrors\n  4. The metric enablement check only happens later in the data point recording phase\n\n### Collector version\n\nv0.124.0\n\n### Environment information\n\n## Environment\nOS: macOS Darwin 24.5.0\n  Compiler: go version go1.23.3 darwin/arm64\n  OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib version: v0.124.0 (also reproduced on main branch)\n\n\n### OpenTelemetry Collector configuration\n\n```yaml\n\n```\n\n### Log output\n\n```shell\n\n```\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Tip\n\n<sub>[React](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) with \uD83D\uDC4D to help prioritize this issue.

Instead, I???d prefer using flags or environment variables to manage lightweight deployments.\n\nAs suggested in [issue #2052](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo/issues/2052), adopting Docker profiles could be a great solution. This approach would allow the demo to support multiple deployment ???modes??? in a cleaner and more flexible way.", "> The main challenge with using branches is maintainability\n\nYES!\n\nThe profiles is a great idea, but still we would need to make the services more configurable.\nVia env vars we must be able to specify if a service calls another or not", ">  Via env vars we must be able to specify if a service calls another or not\n\nThis would be a great addition, not only for a \"lighter\" demo, but also for contributing to and developing the demo. I sometimes struggle how to do small tweaks or changes to services without running the whole demo, especially for services with a high amount of down stream services (frontend, checkout, recommendation, etc.)\n\nOf course this should not be a default behavior, i.e. if the service is not available, the other service should still report errors or fail, but having a way to say \"run this without downstream service\" as an option would be great, e.g. looking at the recommendation service right now, what if I could set a `WITHOUT_PRODUCT_CATALOG` environment variable to `1` or `true` and insead of retrieving data from the product catalog service it simply uses some mock data.\n\nThis would also be a great \"first good issue\"/\"help wanted\" as it has a clear scope per service:-)", "I can have a look at this. I've already been investigating how to run the demo app on a machine with 8GB RAM or less and discussing this on Slack with @julianocosta89. So I feel this ties in nicely to the same work." ],

      "description" : "### Summary\n\nThe front-end lacks showing organization member listing on the organization details page (`/settings/organizations/[slug]`), however, all the pieces that are needed to implement showing the member list are available.\r\n\r\nBy this point, the organization details should be in the related slice on the front-end, including the `teams` (or `roles`) of the organization. Unfortunately, the organization members are not stored with their team details, so it must be fetched separately, one by one. This is not the most efficient, especially not for several teams, but for the MVP it is ???good enough???.\r\n\r\nSince the Organization API returns only the team IDs that the organization have, to get the team details, a call must be made to the [Organization Roles API](https://github.com/opcotech/elemo/blob/main/api/openapi/openapi.yaml#L1996-L2032) which returns the team details. To get the members of a given team, use the [Organization Role Members API](https://github.com/opcotech/elemo/blob/main/api/openapi/openapi.yaml#L2151-L2186). The endpoint returns the list of members per role. These calls are independent (as both requires the organization ID and/or role ID, which is already available).\r\n\r\nWith the information returned from these APIs, add the list of members with the following details about them below the company details: profile picture, name, email, status. Either group the members by their role or add a badge next to their name with the role name. The members which has ???deleted??? status should be listed as well, however, those members should be at the bottom of the list. If the current user is in the list, mark it with a green ???you??? badge next to its name. The badge is [available locally](https://github.com/opcotech/elemo/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#web-component-design) in Storybook.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to bother with member management (add/remote/change role). That's not in scope for this issue.\r\n\r\nBlocked on #155.\r\n\r\n_End-to-end tests are not strictly necessary, but highly welcomed._\n\n### Example Use-cases\n\n- As an organization admin, I want to see who is in the team and what roles do they have.\r\n- As an organization member, I want to see my peers, so if escalation is needed, I know who to contact.\n\n### Drawbacks\n\nAs we have no endpoint to return the list of members combined with their roles, the load time for that page will be bad, but not unmanageable.",

Enhancing it with recognizable icons (email, GitHub, LinkedIn) will make the footer look more polished and interactive.\n\n## ??? Possible Solution  \nReplace the plain text link with clickable icons:\n??? Email (using a mailto: link)  \n??? GitHub icon linking to the repository/user profile  \n??? LinkedIn icon linking to your profile  \n\nApply HTML/CSS-only styling:\n??? Add hover effects (color transitions, scale up/small animation)  \n??? Ensure the icons are evenly spaced, centered, and visually coherent with the footer???s design  \n??? Use semantic HTML and accessible attributes (alt or aria-label)  \n\n## \uD83D\uDCDD Additional Context  \nThis UI enhancement can be implemented with a simple HTML snippet and CSS classes. Here's an example you can adapt:\n\n```html\n<footer>\n  <div class=\"footer-social-icons\">\n    <a href=\"mailto:youremail@example.com\" aria-label=\"Email\">\n      <i class=\"fa fa-envelope\"></i> contact us\n    </a>\n  </div>\n</footer>\nI would love to work on this issue! \uD83D\uDCAA\n",

      "repositoryName" : "tqec/tqec",
      "description" : "# Logical Hadamard Transition\r\n\r\nThe logical Hadamard transition allows X(Z) type correlation surface to be changed to Z(X) type either in space or time. The necessary ingredients to implement the feature is ready in the codebase and it should  be a good starting point for the new contributors to get themselves familiar with the project.\r\n\r\n## 1. Temporal Hadamard Transition\r\n\r\n### 1.1 Construction\r\n\r\nThe temporal Hadamard transition is simply a transversal layer of H gates applied to all data qubits. Note that the boundary conditions of the code patches before and after the transition are flipped, meaning the X(Z) boundary changes to Z(X), and the stabilizer types of the patch are also inverted.\r\n\r\n![??????](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc51a86a-1920-41d5-a23c-1da5cd0ce2cc)\r\n\r\n\r\n### 1.2 Example\r\n\r\nYou can create a minimal example of a computation that includes the temporal Hadamard transition:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom tqec import BlockGraph, Cube, Position3D, ZXCube, SignedDirection3D, Direction3D\r\n\r\ng = BlockGraph()\r\ng.add_edge(\r\n    Cube(Position3D(0, 0, 0), ZXCube.from_str(\"ZXZ\")),\r\n    Cube(Position3D(0, 0, 1), ZXCube.from_str(\"XZX\")),\r\n)\r\ncorrelation_surfaces = g.to_zx_graph().find_correration_surfaces()\r\ng.view_as_html(\r\n    pop_faces_at_direction=SignedDirection3D(Direction3D.Y, False),\r\n    show_correlation_surface=correlation_surfaces[0],\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n![Temporal Logical Hadamard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68a2ac7a-b064-4da5-babb-a245734b4246)\r\n\r\n\r\n## 2. Spatial Hadamard Transition\r\n\r\n### 2.1 Construction\r\n\r\nThe spatial Hadamard transition is more complex. It involves replacing plaquettes on the boundaries of connected cubes. Specifically, new plaquettes measuring `ZXZX` and `XZXZ` stabilizers must be introduced at the boundary.\r\n\r\n![??????](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d80ba83f-6d1d-4283-8707-00946ddcd5b0)\r\n\r\n\r\n### 2.2 Example\r\n\r\nYou can create a minimal example of a computation that includes the spatial Hadamard transition with the following code:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom tqec import BlockGraph, Cube, Position3D, ZXCube, SignedDirection3D, Direction3D\r\n\r\ng = BlockGraph()\r\ng.add_edge(\r\n    Cube(Position3D(0, 0, 0), ZXCube.from_str(\"ZXZ\")),\r\n    Cube(Position3D(1, 0, 0), ZXCube.from_str(\"XZX\")),\r\n)\r\ncorrelation_surfaces = g.to_zx_graph().find_correration_surfaces()\r\ng.view_as_html(\r\n    pop_faces_at_direction=SignedDirection3D(Direction3D.Y, False),\r\n    show_correlation_surface=correlation_surfaces[0],\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n![Spatial Logical Hadamard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d0bc6fe-345f-4cf9-8dd6-46667a07d47b)\r\n\r\n## 3. Implementation\r\n\r\nTo implement this feature, consider starting with the CSS-type surface code, which has a simpler circuit. The main changes will be in `src/tqec/compile/specs/library/_utils` particularly in the `default_substitution_builder` function. You will need to create new plaquettes that support the transition; existing plaquette builders can be found in `src/tqec/plaquette/library`, which you may modify as needed.\r\n\r\nRegarding of temporal transition, there is an issue I'm aware of: if you implement a plaquette with a layer of H gates at the end of the circuit, i.e. after the measurements, then it will break the condition used by detector automation that there are no gates between measurements and resets. However, if you insert a layer of H gates before the measurements or after the resets, it will break the schedule of the circuits. @nelimee any idea on that? It seems reasonable to me that we should make some changes on the detector automation side to tolerate such cases.\r\n\r\nFor the boundary plaquette circuits that implement spatial transition, please refer to the figure above which includes both the stabilizer configuration and CNOTs order.  If further guidance is needed, I can provide sample circuits in [crumble](https://algassert.com/crumble).\r\n\r\nTesting the implementation can be done using the example code above to generate a `BlockGraph`. Use the compilation pipeline from the README to create stim circuits, which you can then verify in Crumble.\r\n\r\nThese are just my initial thoughts on the issue; there may be some details I haven???t covered. If you run into any problems, please feel free to reach out here or via email :-)\r\n",

It seems reasonable to me that we should make some changes on the detector automation side to tolerate such cases.\r\n\r\nThere are two major issues here that I would like to discuss in the future (and probably not here):\r\n\r\n1. There are a few \"things\" in the code that are hard-coded and require to match across several places right now. `Plaquettes` instances needing to be hand-made for each template (because each template might have its own plaquette indexing), template instantiation indices on the spatial boundaries, plaquette scheduling, and I am pretty sure that there are a few more things. We should think about whether this is fine for us, or if we should make that less manual / error-prone. I will open an issue on that soon.\r\n2. The detector computation part could very much be improved. It is lacking tests, it is not really performant, we might even benefit from more features (i.e., being able to only compute detectors involving at least one measurement from a given set of measurements instead of computing all the detectors and filtering them afterwards). #378 might be a good start.

      "description" : "We've come up with a training recipe for 2:4 activation sparsity, which is outlined in this paper: https://openreview.net/pdf?id=O5feVk7p6Y\n\nThe gist of this approach is that:\n\n1) we find high level of activation sparsity (> 85%) when training SquaredRELU based FFNs instead of SwiGLU FFNs. These Squared-RELU based FFNs show minimal to no accuracy loss. \n2) We accelerate the sparse activation x dense weight matmul with 2:4 sparsity. We can naively sparsity for the forwards pass, dropping values to fit the 2:4 constraint if they do not fit. For the backwards pass, we need some special sauce to mantain accuraccy. \n\nHowever @janeyx99 pointed out to me that instead of accelerating the model using 2:4 sparsity, we can seek to exploit (1) with activation compression instead. The idea here is that we can use something like [nvcomp](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvcomp) to compress the sparse squared-relu activations. \n\nWe should run some tests to know what compression ratio and thus the memory savings we could achieve, as well as if there's additional overhead for the compression to account for.

      "comments" : [ "Hi @jcaip, this seems an interesting take on activation sparsity. I would like to know if the model activations are highly sparse (>85% onwards), wont restricting them to a 50% sparsity be creating a hard upper bound? I think an unstructured sparse kernel make more sense in such scenarios, and makes for CPU inferencing a case as well.\n\n", "@agrawal-aka Yes that's correct, we have a max 2x acceleration with 2:4 sparsity at 50%, but theoretically we can push this higher. The difficulty with unstructured sparsity is that 1) it is hard to accelerate on GPU 2) we need to efficiently create the metadata for the sparse matrix at runtime, as we don't have the activations beforehand. Doing so for a more general sparsity pattern is not something I've considered deeply but probably can be done (or at least it should be possible to figure out if this approach is feasible). I've been thinking about combining this with maybe https://openreview.net/pdf?id=gWHQQagPbN \n\nCPU inferencing is a good point, but is this something that people care about? If so, I'd love to hear any insights you have here. I've been very GPU focused but not super familiar with the space. ", "Hi @jcaip,\n\nThanks for your response.\n\nI???m interested in exploring how activation compression might be integrated into model inference. Could you clarify at what point in the forward pass the compression and subsequent decompression should occur? Additionally, are there any specific task items or preliminary PR ideas you???re considering for this feature?\n\nOn the topic of CPU inferencing, community work from ARM, AWS, Neural Magic, and Cerebras highlights a growing interest in efficiency improvements through quantization and sparsity. For example:\n\n1. [ARM???s blog on LLM inference on the Neoverse V2 using int4 kernels](https://community.arm.com/arm-community-blogs/b/servers-and-cloud-computing-blog/posts/llm-inference-demo-with-pytorch-on-arm-neoverse-v2) \n2. [AWS???s posts on optimized PyTorch 2.0 inference with Graviton processors](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/optimized-pytorch-2-0-inference-with-aws-graviton-processors/), showing up to 50% cost savings\n3. [AWS???s posts on SLM inferencing using CPUs](https://community.aws/content/2pViH36qEfqDYwv0kEysJ0kqDp4/small-language-models-slms-inference-with-llama-cpp-on-graviton4) \n4. [Neural Magic???s demonstrations of significant speedups with fused sparse and quantized kernels](https://neuralmagic.com/blog/speed-up-your-llms-with-sparsegpt-and-deepsparse-on-cpus/)\n5. [Cerebras???s exploration of a 70% unstructured sparse LLaMA model achieving high accuracy with CPU inference via DeepSparse](https://neuralmagic.com/blog/speed-up-your-llms-with-sparsegpt-and-deepsparse-on-cpus/)\n\nThese examples indicate a notable momentum around CPU-based inference, suggesting that further investigation into activation compression could prove valuable across both GPU and CPU contexts.\nLooking forward to your thoughts!", "@agrawal-aka \n\n> Could you clarify at what point in the forward pass the compression and subsequent decompression should occur?\n\nFrom my understanding, activation compression would be of minimal use during inference, because you don't need to store the activations for the backwards pass like you do during training. During training, instead of storing the full activation, you would compress it and stored the compressed activation, and during your bw pass, you would uncompress. \n\nI think the only time that this would help for inference is if your model activations don't fit inside your GPU memory, in which case you could load the compressed activations instead of the full ones when doing activation checkpointing. cc @janeyx99 who might know better here. \n\n>Additionally, are there any specific task items or preliminary PR ideas you???re considering for this feature?\n\nI think the first step is to see the overhead of these compression routines, I'm unfamiliar so it would be good to know how much memory / loading time we would save. I'm not planning to work on this as I'm busy working on the kernels for 2:4 activation sparsity ATM, if you're interested would gladly accept a PR. \n\nThanks for the links, will check them out. I think for edge / CPU contexts specifically, there may be more room for speedups as you are more likely to be memory bound than compute bound. cc @syed-shakib7 who might be interested in this as well. \n\n\n", "thanks @jcaip, for giving the clarity about activation compression. \n\nAlso from my understanding for weight sparsity format creation is a one-time overhead before inferencing, but as you mentioned there is development in progress for 2:4 activation sparsity, how is the format creation overhead being handled in that case, if we have to do it at runtime? \n\nAs you mentioned, \n\n> From my understanding, activation compression would be of minimal use during inference\n\nCurrently, I am inclined towards working in inferencing, especially for CPU use cases. Do let me know if there are any task items or preliminary PR ideas you think from a weight/activation sparsity inference point of view. Would love to collaborate.", "> I've been thinking about combining this with maybe https://openreview.net/pdf?id=gWHQQagPbN\n\n@jcaip Hi, I am interested in this (Sparse Attention). It seems that https://openreview.net/pdf?id=gWHQQagPbN focused on weight sparsification. Therefore [BigBird???s Sparse Attention](https://medium.com/@vishal09vns/sparse-attention-dad17691478c) and [FAVOR+](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14794) can be a choice for Sparse Attention.\n\nBut how about focusing on KV-compression or attention algorithms like FlashAttention because it is a well-established field? [longctx_bench](https://github.com/henryzhongsc/longctx_bench) could be a choice for KV-compression techniques." ],

I am using AWS Opensearch version 2.19.\n\nI recently attempted to upgrade from Jaeger 2.5.0 to 2.6.0, but I have ran into a bug with Index Creation using the opensearch storage backend which is causing my Jaeger service to fail.\n\nThis commit https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/commit/1b1cfe205e6e8724718b92dda3f70ed4969c2031 by @timonegk sets the gzip encryption by default, but I do not believe we want this on the call to create the index, rather just on calls which submit traces.\n\nRolling back to 2.5.0 successfully creates my index.\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nSetup latest jaeger 2.6.0 to use an AWS Opensearch storage backend\nAttempt to start Jaeger, see failure in OS Index creation.\nRoll back to 2.5.0 and see OS Index creation succeed.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nIndex creates successfully and my Jaeger instance turns healthy.\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```shell\n`Error: cannot start pipelines: failed to start \"jaeger_storage_exporter\" exporter: cannot create trace write: failed to create template \"traces-jaeger-span\": elastic: Error 500 (Internal Server Error): Compressor detection can only be called on some xcontent bytes or compressed xcontent bytes [type=not_x_content_exception]`\n```\n\n### Screenshot\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Jaeger backend version\n\n2.6.0\n\n### SDK\n\nLatest jaeger version attempting to store traces in 2.19 Opensearch AWS.\nhttps://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/blob/main/cmd/jaeger/config-opensearch.yaml Use this configuration.\n\n### Pipeline\n\n_No response_\n\n### Stogage backend\n\nAWS OpenSearch\n\n### Operating system\n\nLinux\n\n### Deployment model\n\nECS\n\n### Deployment configs\n\n```shell\n\n```",

I'm [Dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot) and I???m helping the dify team.\n\n<!-- Answer -->\nThis error is likely caused by missing null/undefined checks in the frontend code for the Question Classifier node panel. When you click the node during execution, the required state or data may not be available yet, leading to a crash if the component tries to access properties of a null object. This pattern has been seen in other Dify issues and is often resolved by adding robust null guards and error handling in the relevant React components to prevent the UI from crashing if data is missing or in transition ([example](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/16142), [example](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/16173)).\n\nRecent pull requests have improved variable validation and error handling for workflow nodes, but there???s no direct evidence this specific bug is fixed in 1.7.0. Upgrading to the latest version may help, as changes like [#21766](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/21766), [#21932](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/21932), and [#22462](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/22462) have touched related areas. If upgrading isn???t possible, a workaround is to add null checks in the Question Classifier node???s panel/component rendering logic (see `web/app/components/workflow/nodes/_base/components/workflow-panel/index.tsx`) to ensure the UI doesn???t try to access properties of a null object during rapid state changes.\n\nIf you have custom modifications, double-check that all node data is initialized before rendering, and consider adding fallback UI or error messages when required data is missing ([reference](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/20725)).\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

      "description" : "### JabRef version\n\n6.0-alpha2\n\n### Operating system\n\nWindows\n\n### Details on version and operating system\n\nWindows 11\n\n### Checked with the latest development build (copy version output from About dialog)\n\n- [x] I made a backup of my libraries before testing the latest development version.\n- [x] I have tested the latest development version and the problem persists\n\n### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\n\n1. Start JabRef\n2. Start a LibreOffice Writer document instance\n3. Connect to the document instance from JabRef's OO/LO panel\n4. Open a new library\n5. Add the following entries to your library:\n```bibtex\n@Article{????2025,\n  author = {????},\n  title  = {You},\n  year   = {2025},\n}\n\n@Article{??2025,\n  author = {??},\n  title  = {I},\n  year   = {2025},\n}\n```\n6. Select a CSL style from the \"Select Style\" dialog of the OO/LO panel\n7. Cite any of the above entries\n8. Click the \"Make/Sync\" bibliography button from the OO/LO panel (not needed if `OO Panel->Settings->Automatically sync bibliography` is enabled)\n\nYou will observe the following exception (see appendix) along with the error dialog:\n```plain\nNo cited entries found in the document.\n```\nAnd log:\n```plain\n2025-06-10 22:32:55 [JavaFX Application Thread] org.jabref.logic.openoffice.ReferenceMark.parse()\nWARN: CSLReferenceMark: name=JABREF_????2025 CID_1 e2b1z2jv does not match pattern. Assuming random values\n```\n\n### Cause\nNon-Latin characters are not recognized valid in the \"reference marks\" format used for LO/OO in JabRef\n\n### Hints to solve\nAdapt the regex in:\nhttps://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/1ba35d20dbdd0b4aac33e1e594269d76302791b0/jablib/src/main/java/org/jabref/logic/openoffice/ReferenceMark.java#L18-L19\n\n### Pre-requisite context for people not familiar with this aspect of JabRef:\n**OO/LO integration:** https://docs.jabref.org/cite/openofficeintegration\n**CSL styles - citing and generating bibliographies:** https://blog.jabref.org/2024/08/26/GSoC-CSL/\n**\"Reference marks\" in LibreOffice:** https://devdocs.jabref.org/code-howtos/openoffice/overview.html (may be slightly outdated but conceptually valid).\n\n### Test for completion:\nScreen recording of bibliography being successfully generated in the document from the entries mentioned.\n\n### Appendix\n\n...\n<details>\n\n<summary>Log

Looking at the code, I can see that:\n\n1. **Organization pages use different navigation**: They use `organization_sidenav.html` (a completely different black sidebar) instead of the main site's navigation\n2. **Different base templates**: Organization admin pages extend `base_dashboard.html` instead of the standard `base.html`\n3. **Missing consistency**: The organization pages don't have the same header/navbar and sidebar that the rest of the site uses\n\n### **What needs to be done:**\n\n1. **Identify organization pages**: The main organization pages that need fixing are:\n   - `admin_dashboard_organization.html` \n   - `admin_dashboard_organization_detail.html`\n   - Any other organization-related pages\n\n2. **Update the base template**: Change these pages from extending `base_dashboard.html` to `base.html` so they get the proper header\n\n3. **Update navigation includes**: Replace the `{% include \"includes/admin_sidenav.html\" %}` or `{% include \"includes/organization_sidenav.html\" %}` with `{% include \"includes/sidenav.html\" %}` to use the main site's sidebar\n\n4. **Ensure proper layout**: Make sure the organization pages integrate seamlessly with the main site's layout and navigation\n\n### **The Process:**\n\n1. **Step 1**: Examine all organization-related templates\n2. **Step 2**: Change the `{% extends %}` directive from `base_dashboard.html` to `base.html`\n3. **Step 3**: Update the sidebar includes to use the main navigation\n4. **Step 4**: Test that the pages work correctly with the main site's header and sidebar\n5. **Step 5**: Ensure the organization-specific functionality still works within the main layout\n\nThe goal is to make the organization section look and feel like it's part of the same website, with the same header (navbar) and sidebar navigation that users see on other pages, rather than having its own separate black sidebar and different styling.\n\nWould you like me to help you identify all the specific files that need to be modified for this task?\n\n---\n\n\uD83C\uDFC1 Script executed:\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n# Check if there are organization-specific templates that currently use a different base\nfind website/templates -name \"*organization*\" -type f | head -10\n```\n\nLength of output: 705\n\n---\n\n\uD83C\uDFC1 Script executed:\n```\n#!/bash\n# Look for templates that might be organization pages based on URLs\ngrep -r \"organization/\" website/templates/ | grep -E \"(url|href)\" | head -10\n```\n\nLength of output: 1878\n\n---\n\n\uD83C\uDFC1 Script executed:\n```\n#!/bin/bash  \n# Look at the URLs/views to understand the organization section structure\ngrep -r \"organization\" website/urls.py | head -10\n```\n\nLength of output: 98\n\n---\n\n\uD83C\uDFC1 Script executed:\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n# Check what template files are used for the organization dashboard\nfind website/templates -name \"*\" -type f | xargs grep -l \"organization_dashboard\\|organization_\" | head -10\n```\n\nLength of output: 480\n\n---\n\n\uD83C\uDFC1 Script executed:\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n# Look for the urls.py file to understand organization routes\nfind . -name \"urls.py\" | head -5\n```\n\nLength of output: 46\n\n---\n\n\uD83C\uDFC1 Script executed:\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n# Check the organization dashboard base template\ncat website/templates/organization/dashboard/organization_dashboard_base.html\n```\n\nLength of output: 8405\n\n---\n\n\uD83C\uDFC1 Script executed:\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n# Look at one of the organization dashboard pages to see current structure\ncat website/templates/organization/dashboard/organization_analytics.html | head -30\n```\n\nLength of output: 1727\n\n---\n\n\uD83C\uDFC1 Script executed:\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n# Check how many organization templates extend which base\ngrep -r \"extends\" website/templates/organization/ | head -10\n```\n\nLength of output: 1361\n\n---\n\n\n\n</details>\n\nPerfect! Now I have a much clearer picture. Let me give you a comprehensive understanding of what needs to be done.\n\n## **Complete Understanding of the Issue**\n\n@nitish22059 Based on my analysis, here's exactly what DonnieBLT means and what needs to be fixed:\n\n### **The Problem:**\n\nThere are **TWO different organization sections** that are inconsistent:\n\n1. **Admin Organization Pages** (the broken ones):\n   - `admin_dashboard_organization.html` \n   - `admin_dashboard_organization_detail.html`\n   - These extend `base_dashboard.html` (missing main nav/sidebar)\n   - Use `admin_sidenav.html` (different navigation)\n\n2. **User Organization Dashboard** (the correctly implemented ones):\n   - All files in `website/templates/organization/dashboard/`\n   - These already extend `organization_dashboard_base.html` \n   - `organization_dashboard_base.html` **already includes** the correct header and sidebar:\n     ```html\n     {% include \"includes/header.html\" %}\n     {% include \"includes/sidenav.html\" %}\n     ```\n\n### **What DonnieBLT Actually Wants:**\n\nThe **admin organization pages** (the first group) need to be updated to match the consistent layout that the **user organization dashboard** already has.\n\n### **The Specific Solution:**\n\nYou need to update these **2 admin templates**:\n\n1. **Fix `admin_dashboard_organization.html`:**\n   ```html\n   <!-- CHANGE FROM: -->\n   {% extends \"base_dashboard.html\" %}\n   {% include \"includes/admin_sidenav.html\" %}\n   \n   <!-- CHANGE TO: -->\n   {% extends \"base.html\" %} \n   {% include \"includes/sidenav.html\" %}\n   ```\n\n2. **Fix `admin_dashboard_organization_detail.html`:**\n   ```html\n   <!-- CHANGE FROM: -->\n   {% extends \"base_dashboard.html\" %}\n   {% include \"includes/admin_sidenav.html\" %}\n   \n   <!-- CHANGE TO: -->\n   {% extends \"base.html\" %}\n   {% include \"includes/sidenav.html\" %}\n   ```\n\n### **Why This Fixes It:**\n\n- `base.html` includes the proper header (`navbar.html`) \n- `sidenav.html` is the main sidebar that matches the rest of the site\n- This makes the admin organization pages consistent with both the main site and the user organization dashboard pages\n\n### **Step-by-Step Process:**\n\n1. Open `website/templates/admin_dashboard_organization.html`\n2. Change line 1 from `{% extends \"base_dashboard.html\" %}` to `{% extends \"base.html\" %}`\n3. Find the line with `{% include \"includes/admin_sidenav.html\" %}` and change it to `{% include \"includes/sidenav.html\" %}`\n4. Repeat the same changes for `website/templates/admin_dashboard_organization_detail.html`\n5.

Looking at the code, I can see that:\n\n1. **Organization pages use different navigation**: They use `organization_sidenav.html` (a completely different black sidebar) instead of the main site's navigation\n2. **Different base templates**: Organization admin pages extend `base_dashboard.html` instead of the standard `base.html`\n3. **Missing consistency**: The organization pages don't have the same header/navbar and sidebar that the rest of the site uses\n\n### **What needs to be done:**\n\n1. **Identify organization pages**: The main organization pages that need fixing are:\n   - `admin_dashboard_organization.html` \n   - `admin_dashboard_organization_detail.html`\n   - Any other organization-related pages\n\n2. **Update the base template**: Change these pages from extending `base_dashboard.html` to `base.html` so they get the proper header\n\n3. **Update navigation includes**: Replace the `{% include \"includes/admin_sidenav.html\" %}` or `{% include \"includes/organization_sidenav.html\" %}` with `{% include \"includes/sidenav.html\" %}` to use the main site's sidebar\n\n4. **Ensure proper layout**: Make sure the organization pages integrate seamlessly with the main site's layout and navigation\n\n### **The Process:**\n\n1. **Step 1**: Examine all organization-related templates\n2. **Step 2**: Change the `{% extends %}` directive from `base_dashboard.html` to `base.html`\n3. **Step 3**: Update the sidebar includes to use the main navigation\n4. **Step 4**: Test that the pages work correctly with the main site's header and sidebar\n5. **Step 5**: Ensure the organization-specific functionality still works within the main layout\n\nThe goal is to make the organization section look and feel like it's part of the same website, with the same header (navbar) and sidebar navigation that users see on other pages, rather than having its own separate black sidebar and different styling.\n\nWould you like me to help you identify all the specific files that need to be modified for this task?\n\n---\n\n\uD83C\uDFC1 Script executed:\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n# Check if there are organization-specific templates that currently use a different base\nfind website/templates -name \"*organization*\" -type f | head -10\n```\n\nLength of output: 705\n\n---\n\n\uD83C\uDFC1 Script executed:\n```\n#!/bash\n# Look for templates that might be organization pages based on URLs\ngrep -r \"organization/\" website/templates/ | grep -E \"(url|href)\" | head -10\n```\n\nLength of output: 1878\n\n---\n\n\uD83C\uDFC1 Script executed:\n```\n#!/bin/bash  \n# Look at the URLs/views to understand the organization section structure\ngrep -r \"organization\" website/urls.py | head -10\n```\n\nLength of output: 98\n\n---\n\n\uD83C\uDFC1 Script executed:\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n# Check what template files are used for the organization dashboard\nfind website/templates -name \"*\" -type f | xargs grep -l \"organization_dashboard\\|organization_\" | head -10\n```\n\nLength of output: 480\n\n---\n\n\uD83C\uDFC1 Script executed:\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n# Look for the urls.py file to understand organization routes\nfind . -name \"urls.py\" | head -5\n```\n\nLength of output: 46\n\n---\n\n\uD83C\uDFC1 Script executed:\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n# Check the organization dashboard base template\ncat website/templates/organization/dashboard/organization_dashboard_base.html\n```\n\nLength of output: 8405\n\n---\n\n\uD83C\uDFC1 Script executed:\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n# Look at one of the organization dashboard pages to see current structure\ncat website/templates/organization/dashboard/organization_analytics.html | head -30\n```\n\nLength of output: 1727\n\n---\n\n\uD83C\uDFC1 Script executed:\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n# Check how many organization templates extend which base\ngrep -r \"extends\" website/templates/organization/ | head -10\n```\n\nLength of output: 1361\n\n---\n\n\n\n</details>\n\nPerfect! Now I have a much clearer picture. Let me give you a comprehensive understanding of what needs to be done.\n\n## **Complete Understanding of the Issue**\n\n@nitish22059 Based on my analysis, here's exactly what DonnieBLT means and what needs to be fixed:\n\n### **The Problem:**\n\nThere are **TWO different organization sections** that are inconsistent:\n\n1. **Admin Organization Pages** (the broken ones):\n   - `admin_dashboard_organization.html` \n   - `admin_dashboard_organization_detail.html`\n   - These extend `base_dashboard.html` (missing main nav/sidebar)\n   - Use `admin_sidenav.html` (different navigation)\n\n2. **User Organization Dashboard** (the correctly implemented ones):\n   - All files in `website/templates/organization/dashboard/`\n   - These already extend `organization_dashboard_base.html` \n   - `organization_dashboard_base.html` **already includes** the correct header and sidebar:\n     ```html\n     {% include \"includes/header.html\" %}\n     {% include \"includes/sidenav.html\" %}\n     ```\n\n### **What DonnieBLT Actually Wants:**\n\nThe **admin organization pages** (the first group) need to be updated to match the consistent layout that the **user organization dashboard** already has.\n\n### **The Specific Solution:**\n\nYou need to update these **2 admin templates**:\n\n1. **Fix `admin_dashboard_organization.html`:**\n   ```html\n   &lt;!-- CHANGE FROM: --&gt;\n   {% extends \"base_dashboard.html\" %}\n   {% include \"includes/admin_sidenav.html\" %}\n   \n   &lt;!-- CHANGE TO: --&gt;\n   {% extends \"base.html\" %} \n   {% include \"includes/sidenav.html\" %}\n   ```\n\n2. **Fix `admin_dashboard_organization_detail.html`:**\n   ```html\n   &lt;!-- CHANGE FROM: --&gt;\n   {% extends \"base_dashboard.html\" %}\n   {% include \"includes/admin_sidenav.html\" %}\n   \n   &lt;!-- CHANGE TO: --&gt;\n   {% extends \"base.html\" %}\n   {% include \"includes/sidenav.html\" %}\n   ```\n\n### **Why This Fixes It:**\n\n- `base.html` includes the proper header (`navbar.html`) \n- `sidenav.html` is the main sidebar that matches the rest of the site\n- This makes the admin organization pages consistent with both the main site and the user organization dashboard pages\n\n### **Step-by-Step Process:**\n\n1. Open `website/templates/admin_dashboard_organization.html`\n2. Change line 1 from `{% extends \"base_dashboard.html\" %}` to `{% extends \"base.html\" %}`\n3. Find the line with `{% include \"includes/admin_sidenav.html\" %}` and change it to `{% include \"includes/sidenav.html\" %}`\n4. Repeat the same changes for `website/templates/admin_dashboard_organization_detail.html`\n5. Test the pages to ensure they work correctly\n\nThe user organization dashboard pages in `/organization/dashboard/` are **already correctly implemented** and don't need changes.\n\nDoes this make it clear what needs to be done?</answer></rawResChunk> -->" ],

Write a brief description of how you will approach the task (without using ChatGPT).\n3. Add your Telegram handler in your application (e.g., in OnlyDust or similar)\n4. Write ETA in your application\n\n\n\n## What should I do if I have a problem\n1. Try to google it before asking. Googling is taking major part of dev work \n2. If you couldn't find answer your question with Google, text your question to [dev](https://t.me/spotnet_dev/4) group with your question.\n3. Do not send DM to maintainer, it would be better and faster to ask other contributors in chat \n\n\n## How to prepare PR\n1. Check if your code [smell](https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/smells) good\n2. Add `close #<issue number>` to link your issue with your PR\n3. Do not commit changes that are unrelated to your task\n4. Check after you created PR, if you committed everything\n\n\n## Task Description\n1. **Update Endpoint Behavior**  \n   Refactor the `/admin/me` endpoint to return the currently authenticated admin's data.  \n   It should:\n   - Rely on the authentication token to identify the admin\n   - Return relevant admin fields (e.g. `id`, `email`, `is_super_admin`)\n   - Exclude sensitive data such as password hashes\n\n2. **Ensure Secure Access**  \n   Make sure the route is protected and only accessible to authenticated admin users.\n\n3. **Update Response Schema**  \n   Use a clear and secure response model to structure the output.\n\n4. **Write Tests**  \n   Add tests for:\n   - Authenticated access\n   - Unauthorized access\n   - Correct data structure\n\n5. **Verify CI Workflow**  \n   Ensure all tests pass and the workflow remains green.",

Create cleanup manager in `src/core/lifecycle/cleanup.ts`:\n```typescript\nexport class CleanupManager {\n    private cleanupTasks: Array<() => Promise<void>> = [];\n    private isShuttingDown = false;\n\n    addCleanupTask(task: () => Promise<void>): void {\n        if (this.isShuttingDown) {\n            throw new Error('Cannot add cleanup tasks during shutdown');\n        }\n        this.cleanupTasks.push(task);\n    }\n\n    removeCleanupTask(task: () => Promise<void>): void {\n        const index = this.cleanupTasks.indexOf(task);\n        if (index > -1) {\n            this.cleanupTasks.splice(index, 1);\n        }\n    }\n\n    async executeCleanup(): Promise<void> {\n        if (this.isShuttingDown) return;\n        \n        this.isShuttingDown = true;\n        logger.info('Starting graceful shutdown...');\n\n        const cleanupPromises = this.cleanupTasks.map(async (task, index) => {\n            try {\n                await Promise.race([\n                    task(),\n                    new Promise((_, reject) => \n                        setTimeout(() => reject(new Error('Cleanup timeout')), 5000)\n                    )\n                ]);\n                logger.debug(`Cleanup task ${index + 1} completed`);\n            } catch (error) {\n                logger.error(`Cleanup task ${index + 1} failed:`, error);\n            }\n        });\n\n        await Promise.allSettled(cleanupPromises);\n        logger.info('Graceful shutdown completed');\n    }\n}\n\nexport const cleanupManager = new CleanupManager();\n```\n\n### 2. Add shutdown handlers in `src/core/lifecycle/shutdown.ts`:\n```typescript\nimport { cleanupManager } from './cleanup.js';\nimport { logger } from '../logger/index.js';\n\nexport function registerShutdownHandlers(): void {\n    const signals: NodeJS.Signals[] = ['SIGINT', 'SIGTERM', 'SIGUSR2'];\n    \n    signals.forEach(signal => {\n        process.on(signal, async () => {\n            logger.info(`Received ${signal}, initiating graceful shutdown...`);\n            \n            try {\n                await cleanupManager.executeCleanup();\n                process.exit(0);\n            } catch (error) {\n                logger.error('Error during cleanup:', error);\n                process.exit(1);\n            }\n        });\n    });\n\n    process.on('uncaughtException', async (error) => {\n        logger.error('Uncaught exception:', error);\n        try {\n            await cleanupManager.executeCleanup();\n        } catch (cleanupError) {\n            logger.error('Error during emergency cleanup:', cleanupError);\n        }\n        process.exit(1);\n    });\n\n    process.on('unhandledRejection', async (reason) => {\n        logger.error('Unhandled rejection:', reason);\n        try {\n            await cleanupManager.executeCleanup();\n        } catch (cleanupError) {\n            logger.error('Error during emergency cleanup:', cleanupError);\n        }\n        process.exit(1);\n    });\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Update SaikiAgent to register cleanup tasks:\n```typescript\nexport class SaikiAgent {\n    async start(): Promise<void> {\n        // ... existing start logic\n        \n        // Register cleanup tasks\n        cleanupManager.addCleanupTask(async () => {\n            logger.info('Stopping SaikiAgent...');\n            await this.stop();\n        });\n\n        cleanupManager.addCleanupTask(async () => {\n            logger.info('Closing database connections...');\n            await this.storage.close();\n        });\n    }\n\n    async stop(): Promise<void> {\n        // ... existing stop logic\n        \n        // Remove cleanup tasks since we're manually stopping\n        cleanupManager.removeCleanupTask(this.stopCleanupTask);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Update CLI to register shutdown handlers:\n```typescript\n// src/app/cli/cli.ts\nimport { registerShutdownHandlers } from '../../core/lifecycle/shutdown.js';\n\nexport async function startCLI(): Promise<void> {\n    registerShutdownHandlers();\n    \n    // ... existing CLI logic\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Update server mode to register cleanup:\n```typescript\n// src/app/api/server.ts\nimport { cleanupManager } from '../../core/lifecycle/cleanup.js';\n\nexport async function startServer(): Promise<void> {\n    const server = app.listen(port);\n    \n    cleanupManager.addCleanupTask(async () => {\n        logger.info('Closing HTTP server...');\n        return new Promise((resolve) => {\n            server.close(() => resolve());\n        });\n    });\n}\n```\n\n## Benefits\n1. **Resource Safety**: Prevents resource leaks on unexpected exits\n2. **Data Integrity**: Ensures proper cleanup of temporary files and database transactions\n3. **Better User Experience**: Clean shutdown messages and proper exit codes\n4. **Production Ready**: Essential for server deployments and long-running processes\n\n## Implementation Steps\n1. Create cleanup manager and shutdown handler utilities\n2. Update SaikiAgent to register cleanup tasks\n3. Update CLI to use shutdown handlers\n4. Update server mode to register HTTP server cleanup\n5. Add tests for cleanup scenarios\n6. Update documentation with graceful shutdown behavior\n\n## Files to Create/Update\n- `src/core/lifecycle/cleanup.ts` (new)\n- `src/core/lifecycle/shutdown.ts` (new)\n- `src/core/ai/agent/SaikiAgent.ts`\n- `src/app/cli/cli.ts`\n- `src/app/api/server.ts`\n- `src/app/index.ts`\n- Add tests in `src/core/lifecycle/cleanup.test.ts`\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Cleanup manager handles multiple cleanup tasks with timeout\n- [ ] Shutdown handlers registered for SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGUSR2\n- [ ] SaikiAgent registers proper cleanup tasks\n- [ ] CLI and server modes use graceful shutdown\n- [ ] Uncaught exceptions and unhandled rejections trigger cleanup\n- [ ] Tests verify cleanup behavior\n- [ ] No breaking changes to existing functionality\n- [ ] Documentation updated with shutdown behavior\n\n## Testing Strategy\n```typescript\ndescribe('CleanupManager', () => {\n    it('should execute all cleanup tasks on shutdown', async () => {\n        const cleanupSpy1 = vi.fn().mockResolvedValue(undefined);\n        const cleanupSpy2 = vi.fn().mockResolvedValue(undefined);\n        \n        cleanupManager.addCleanupTask(cleanupSpy1);\n        cleanupManager.addCleanupTask(cleanupSpy2);\n        \n        await cleanupManager.executeCleanup();\n        \n        expect(cleanupSpy1).toHaveBeenCalled();\n        expect(cleanupSpy2).toHaveBeenCalled();\n    });\n\n    it('should handle cleanup task failures gracefully', async () => {\n        const failingTask = vi.fn().mockRejectedValue(new Error('Cleanup failed'));\n        const successTask = vi.fn().mockResolvedValue(undefined);\n        \n        cleanupManager.addCleanupTask(failingTask);\n        cleanupManager.addCleanupTask(successTask);\n        \n        await cleanupManager.executeCleanup();\n        \n        expect(failingTask).toHaveBeenCalled();\n        expect(successTask).toHaveBeenCalled();\n    });\n});\n```\n\n## Estimated Effort\n**2-4 hours** - Good for developers learning about Node.js lifecycle management and graceful shutdown patterns.\n\n## Learning Opportunities\n- Node.js process signals and event handling\n- Resource management and cleanup patterns\n- Async/await error handling\n- Testing shutdown scenarios\n- Production deployment best practices",

Here's a simpler approach that leverages existing functionality:\n\n### Current State\n- ??? **Comprehensive `SaikiAgent.stop()` already exists** - handles SessionManager cleanup, MCP disconnection, storage cleanup, error collection\n- ??? **No signal handlers** - Ctrl+C or SIGTERM exits immediately without calling `agent.stop()`\n\n### Recommended Simple Solution\nCreate an app-layer utility that uses existing `agent.stop()`:\n\n```typescript\n// src/app/utils/graceful-shutdown.ts\nimport type { SaikiAgent } from '@core/index.js';\n\nexport function registerGracefulShutdown(agent: SaikiAgent): void {\n    const signals: NodeJS.Signals[] = ['SIGINT', 'SIGTERM', 'SIGUSR2'];\n    \n    let isShuttingDown = false;\n    \n    signals.forEach(signal => {\n        process.on(signal, async () => {\n            if (isShuttingDown) return; // Prevent multiple shutdowns\n            isShuttingDown = true;\n            \n            console.log(`\\nReceived ${signal}, shutting down gracefully...`);\n            try {\n                await agent.stop(); // Use existing comprehensive shutdown\n                process.exit(0);\n            } catch (error) {\n                console.error('Shutdown error:', error);\n                process.exit(1);\n            }\n        });\n    });\n\n    // Handle uncaught exceptions\n    process.on('uncaughtException', async (error) => {\n        console.error('Uncaught exception:', error);\n        if (\\!isShuttingDown) {\n            isShuttingDown = true;\n            try {\n                await agent.stop();\n            } catch {}\n        }\n        process.exit(1);\n    });\n\n    process.on('unhandledRejection', async (reason) => {\n        console.error('Unhandled rejection:', reason);\n        if (\\!isShuttingDown) {\n            isShuttingDown = true;\n            try {\n                await agent.stop();\n            } catch {}\n        }\n        process.exit(1);\n    });\n}\n```\n\nThen import and call in both application entry points:\n```typescript\n// src/app/api/server.ts\nimport { registerGracefulShutdown } from '../utils/graceful-shutdown.js';\n// ... in initializeApi()\nregisterGracefulShutdown(agent);\n\n// src/app/cli/cli.ts  \nimport { registerGracefulShutdown } from '../utils/graceful-shutdown.js';\n// ... in _initCli()\nregisterGracefulShutdown(agent);\n```\n\n### Benefits of This Approach\n- ??? **Reuses existing tested shutdown logic** (`agent.stop()`)\n- ??? **Single source of truth** for cleanup\n- ??? **App-layer utility** - signal handling is application concern, not core logic\n- ??? **Much simpler** - ~30 lines total\n- ??? **Same functionality** - signal handling + crash protection" ],

      "description" : "## Problem\n\nCurrently, we have issues with how provider API schemas are handled:\n\n### 1. **Struct Duplication Across Layers**\n- Provider request/response types are defined twice:\n  - Once in `core/providers/` (e.g., `OpenAIResponse` in `openai.go`)\n  - Again in `transports/bifrost-http/integrations/` (e.g., `OpenAIChatResponse` in `openai/types.go`)\n- This affects **all 9 providers** with ~25+ duplicate struct definitions total\n- Changes require updates in multiple places, increasing maintenance burden\n\n### 2. **Performance Issues with `map[string]interface{}`**\n- Core providers use `map[string]interface{}` for request construction:\n  ```go\n  requestBody := mergeConfig(map[string]interface{}{\n      \"model\":    model,\n      \"messages\": formattedMessages,\n  }, preparedParams)\n  ```\n- The `prepareParams()` function uses **reflection** to convert structs to maps\n- JSON marshalling with `map[string]interface{}` is 2-3x slower than typed structs\n- Causes unnecessary memory allocations and CPU overhead\n\n### 3. **Type Safety Issues**\n- Runtime errors from map key typos instead of compile-time validation\n- No IDE autocompletion for request fields\n- Harder to refactor and maintain\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nCreate a common provider API schemas directory at `/core/schemas/api/` with one file per provider:\n\n/core/schemas/\n????????? provider.go # (existing) Provider interfaces & config\n????????? api/ # \uD83C\uDD95 NEW - API request/response schemas\n  ????????? openai.go # All OpenAI request/response/error types\n  ????????? anthropic.go # All Anthropic request/response/error types\n  ????????? cohere.go # All Cohere types\n  ????????? bedrock.go # All Bedrock types\n  ????????? shared.go # Common types/utilities\n\n\n## Benefits\n\n### Performance Improvements\n- **2-3x faster JSON marshalling** by using typed structs instead of `map[string]interface{}`\n- **Eliminate reflection overhead** from `prepareParams()` function\n- **Better memory efficiency** - no interface{} boxing or map overhead\n- **Improved CPU cache locality** with typed structs\n\n### Code Quality\n- **Zero duplication** - single source of truth for all provider schemas\n- **Compile-time type safety** instead of runtime map key errors\n- **Better IDE support** - autocompletion, refactoring, go-to-definition\n- **Easier maintenance** - changes only need to be made in one place\n\n### Developer Experience\n- **Consistent API** across core and transport layers\n- **Simpler imports** - just `import \"github.com/maximhq/bifrost/core/schemas/api\"`\n- **Self-documenting** - clear struct definitions instead of magic map keys\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n1. **Create `/core/schemas/api/` directory**\n2. **Move and consolidate provider types** from both `core/providers/` and `transports/bifrost-http/integrations/`\n3. **Update core providers** to use typed structs instead of `map[string]interface{}`\n4. **Update transport integrations** to import from common location\n5. **Remove duplicate struct definitions**\n6. **Update imports across codebase**\n7. **Run tests** to ensure no regressions\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] All provider request/response types moved to `/core/schemas/api/`\n- [ ] Zero usage of `map[string]interface{}` for provider request construction\n- [ ] No duplicate struct definitions between core and transport layers\n- [ ] All tests passing\n- [ ] Performance benchmarks show expected improvements\n- [ ] Clean imports with single source of truth\n\n## Impact\n\nThis refactoring will:\n- **Significantly improve performance** under high throughput scenarios\n- **Reduce codebase complexity** by eliminating ~25+ duplicate structs\n- **Improve type safety** and developer experience\n- **Make adding new providers/integrations easier** with clear patterns to follow\n\n---\n**Priority**: High - Performance and maintainability improvement\n**Effort**: Medium - Requires careful refactoring but clear benefits\n**Breaking Changes**: None (internal refactoring only)",

This commonly happens when stdout is redirected to another program or a file. If you emit ANSI escape codes then the output is no longer \"plain text\" and it makes a bunch of common operations more difficult. It can break programs like `grep` if the search term spans escape codes. It also causes weird things to happen when you use programs like `less` (which will escape the escape codes by default).\n\nIn Deno, we can detect if it's a TTY or not using [`Deno.stdout.isTerminal()`](https://deno.land/api@v1.42.1?s=Deno.FsFile#method_isTerminal_0) method.\n\nSee also: <https://github.com/c4spar/deno-cliffy/issues/695#issuecomment-3006510224>.",

While exploring the project structure, I noticed that there are currently no existing test files under the test/ or androidTest/ directories, and as a result, these folders don???t appear in the Android view of Android Studio.\n\nI did switch to the Project view, where I can see the full directory structure, but I still don???t see the package be.scri.ui.screens.settings under either test or androidTest. From what I understand, this is likely because no tests have been created yet.\n\nJust to be sure, am I expected to manually create the required package structure and test files (SettingsScreenUnitTest.kt and SettingsScreenInstrumentedTest.kt) as suggested in the issue description? Once I get your go-ahead, I???ll proceed with setting them up and start adding the tests.\n\nThank you \uD83D\uDE0A", "Hey @majidhawa\n\nSorry, we were not able to get to you earlier. You would now see the android tests folder structure created in the directory as instrumentation tests are added for the project. If there are no specific tests for any package you could create the package and the subdirectories and then create the files under them for the tests. \n\nThanks for the efforts @majidhawa \uD83D\uDE04 \n", "Thanks so much for the clarification, @angrezichatterbox \uD83D\uDE0A\n\nThat makes perfect sense now. I actually figured it out shortly after and went ahead to manually create the required package structure for both unit and instrumented tests as suggested.\n\nHere???s how I organized the test directories:\n`app/\n      src/\n         test/\n    java/be/scri/ui/screens/settings/SettingsScreenUnitTest.kt\n         androidTest/\n                  java/be/scri/ui/screens/settings/SettingsScreenInstrumentedTest.kt\n`\nWhile setting this up, I initially ran into some issues related to the JDK configuration. Gradle was trying to use Java 21, which didn???t have the required compiler tools, so the tests wouldn???t run. I resolved it by switching to Java 17 and explicitly pointing Gradle to the correct JDK path.\n\nAfter that, I was able to successfully run the unit tests for the Dimensions object. I???m now working on the instrumented tests for SettingsScreen, focusing on Compose UI rendering and ViewModel state handling.\n\nI???ll continue pushing forward and will reach out if anything else comes up. Thanks again for the support.", "Hey hey @majidhawa \uD83D\uDC4B Quick check in to see if you need any support with the work for this issue :) Please let us know if there's anything we can do to support!", "Hey @andrewtavis , Thanks for checking in. I was able to set up the required package structure and got the unit tests for the Dimensions object running successfully. However, I ran into a bit of a blocker with the instrumented tests.\n\nWhen I run all tests together (e.g., using ???Run Tests???), things seem to work fine. But when I try running the instrumented test file individually (SettingsScreenInstrumentedTest.kt), it throws errors. I suspect this might be due to how the test files or dependencies are organized.\n\nI noticed someone else raised a similar concern in the group, so I???m waiting for tomorrow???s meeting to get more clarity and confirm whether I???ve set up everything correctly. Once I???m sure about the structure, I???ll continue with the remaining tests.\n\nThanks again for the support.\n", "@angrezichatterbox  I would like to work on this issue", "I would also like to work on this", "Thanks @navaneeth0041 and @AtharvaNair04 for picking this up!", "@angrezichatterbox I would like to work on this test `UI rendering of ScribeItemList and LazyColumn`" ],

Regardless of how the ingress/LB/cloud handles the traffic, it should end up getting blocked. (Well, unless it gets masqueraded to the pod's node IP, because then it hits that exception to the rules.)\r\n\r\nUnfortunately we can't say the same for egress; I think we assume that a pod-to-service-IP connection will be allowed to reach kube-proxy even if the pod is fully isolated-for-egress, but we explicitly don't require that `ipBlock` policies get applied after service proxying.\r\n\r\nAnyway, we should be able to add a test to `test/e2e/network/netpol/network_policy.go` that confirms that cluster-ingress traffic to a fully isolated-for-ingress pod is not allowed. In particular, if we create a LoadBalancer Service with `externalTrafficPolicy: Local`, and a NetworkPolicy blocking all ingress to that Service's Pods, then we should not be able to connect to the service via either the LoadBalancer IP/name or via its NodePort (on one of the correct nodes).\r\n\r\n/sig network\r\n/area network-policy\r\n/priority backlog\r\n/help\r\n/good-first-issue",

(Well, unless it gets masqueraded to the pod's node IP, because then it hits that exception to the rules.)\r\n>\r\n>Unfortunately we can't say the same for egress; I think we assume that a pod-to-service-IP connection will be allowed to reach kube-proxy even if the pod is fully isolated-for-egress, but we explicitly don't require that `ipBlock` policies get applied after service proxying.\r\n>\r\n>Anyway, we should be able to add a test to `test/e2e/network/netpol/network_policy.go` that confirms that cluster-ingress traffic to a fully isolated-for-ingress pod is not allowed. In particular, if we create a LoadBalancer Service with `externalTrafficPolicy: Local`, and a NetworkPolicy blocking all ingress to that Service's Pods, then we should not be able to connect to the service via either the LoadBalancer IP/name or via its NodePort (on one of the correct nodes).\r\n>\r\n>/sig network\r\n>/area network-policy\r\n>/priority backlog\r\n>/help\r\n>/good-first-issue\n\n\nInstructions for interacting with me using PR comments are available [here](https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/guide/pull-requests.md).

Below is my understanding and proposed approach???please let me know if I???ve missed anything or made any incorrect assumptions. Thanks!\n\n1. **Issue interpretation:** A pod which is fully isolated for ingress must never receive any north/south traffic, even when fronted by a LoadBalancer or NodePort, unless that traffic is SNAT'd to the node IP (which, based on the discussion above, appears to be an expected and accepted exception). Becasue SNAT can occur before or after NetworkPolicy evaluation, the policy may be non-deterministically bypassed depending on the network plugin, cloud provider, or service implementation.\n \n2. **Goal interpretation:** Add a deterministic E2E test that verifies a fully isolated ingress policy blocks all traffic.\n\n3. **Proposed approach:** A test in `/kubernetes/test/e2e/network/loadbalancer.go` that:\n\t1. Deploys a simple HTTP echo-server Pod.\n\t2. Apply a NetworkPolicy with no ingress rules.\n\t3. Create a Service of  type `LoadBalancer` with `externalTrafficPolicy: Local` (to preserve client IP and avoid kube-proxy SNAT/cross-node proxying)\n\t4. From e2e host, attempt to  curl the LoadBalancer IP (and the NodePort on that node).\n\t\t- Pass if connection times out/refuses\n\t\t- Fail if it succeeds\n\n4. **Questions / Considerations:**\n\t- **Test Location**: Should this live under `/kubernetes/test/e2e/network/netpol/network_policy.go` (to keep all NP tests together), or is `network/loadbalancer.go` more appropriate given the LB focus and fact that the current tests in `netpol/network_policy.go` test pod -> pod, while this test requires external -> pod via LB/NodePort.\n\t- **NodePort coverage:** Is an additional test needed for pod ??? Service(NodePort) traffic, since this can also involve SNAT and might expose similar bypass behavior?\n\t- **Underlying non-determinism:** Even with `externalTrafficPolicy: Local` or host-based testing, the root cause, SNAT ordering vs. policy enforcement, remains unpredictable. Can/does this underlying issue need to be addressed?", "> * **Test Location**\n\nProbably `tests/e2e/network/netpol/network_policy.go` should be moved up a level to `test/e2e/network/network_policy.go` (based on the comments in that file, it seems like maybe that was the original plan?), and `netpol/` should only contain the helpers, not the actual e2e tests themselves. And then the new test can be added to `test/e2e/network/network_policy.go`?\n\nNote that wherever it ends up, the test will need both `feature.NetworkPolicy` and `feature.LoadBalancer`.\n\n> * **NodePort coverage**\n\nThe non-`externalTrafficPolicy: Local` case is expected to do SNAT and the `externalTrafficPolicy: Local` case for NodePort is not interestingly different from the LoadBalancer IP case, so there's probably no point in testing this separately.\n\n> * **Underlying non-determinism**\n\nIt's not really \"non-determinism\"; any given environment is deterministic. And some people will run the e2e suite in environments that will fail the test due to SNAT. So I think the result should be:\n- connection is blocked: **Pass**\n- connection is accepted with original source IP preserved: **Fail**\n- connection is accepted with source IP changed: **Skip**\n\nI think having the test skip itself when it detects SNAT is preferable to just telling people \"you should skip this test if your environment doesn't support it\", because you're only supposed to skip it if the connection gets through because your load balancer did the \"wrong\" thing, _not_ if the connection gets through because your _network plugin_ does the wrong thing.", "/assign" ],

Not sure about what setting zero or more FieldProperty means.", "@eric052199 For me, it is not clear, what is unclear to you ^^.\r\n\r\nI try to write a few text on \"Enable setting zero ore more org.jabref.model.entry.field.FieldPropertys.\" Please ask which item should I refine or if you need additional information.\r\n\r\n1. The class [/src/main/java/org/jabref/model/entry/field/FieldProperty.java#L3](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/d81d37faaddd45257e445f1978f97994043dd2d4/src/main/java/org/jabref/model/entry/field/FieldProperty.java#L3) models properties of a field\r\n2. An EntryType specifies which fields are contained\r\n3. Custom Entry types are stored in [/src/main/java/org/jabref/model/entry/types/UnknownEntryType.java#L8](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/d81d37faaddd45257e445f1978f97994043dd2d4/src/main/java/org/jabref/model/entry/types/UnknownEntryType.java#L8)\r\n4. Custom Fields are stored in [org.jabref.model.entry.field.UnknownField](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/d81d37faaddd45257e445f1978f97994043dd2d4/src/main/java/org/jabref/model/entry/field/UnknownField.java#L12)\r\n5. From the UI, a new Custom Entry Type is generated at [org.jabref.gui.preferences.customentrytypes.CustomEntryTypesTabViewModel#addNewCustomEntryType](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/d81d37faaddd45257e445f1978f97994043dd2d4/src/main/java/org/jabref/gui/preferences/customentrytypes/CustomEntryTypesTabViewModel.java#L130)\r\n6. [org.jabref.gui.preferences.customentrytypes.CustomEntryTypesTabViewModel#addNewField](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/d81d37faaddd45257e445f1978f97994043dd2d4/src/main/java/org/jabref/gui/preferences/customentrytypes/CustomEntryTypesTabViewModel.java#L145) is used to add a new field to the customized entry type\r\n7. There, [org.jabref.gui.preferences.customentrytypes.FieldViewModel](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/d81d37faaddd45257e445f1978f97994043dd2d4/src/main/java/org/jabref/gui/preferences/customentrytypes/FieldViewModel.java#L26) class is used to put a single FieldProperty. The issue is to be able to add more than one property\r\n8. JabRef saves the customized entry types into the .bib file:\\\r\n   ```bibtex\r\n   @Comment{jabref-entrytype: person: req[Name] opt[Googlescholar;Orcid]}\r\n   ```\r\n9. an example person looks as follows:\\\r\n   ```bibtex\r\n   @Person{demo,\r\n     name          = {Oliver Kopp},\r\n     googlescholar = {https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=nB2GungAAAAJ&hl=de&oi=ao},\r\n     orcid         = {https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6962-4290},\r\n   }\r\n   ```\r\n10. Proposal for the new format: Use `|` to separate field names with the list field properties: \r\n  - `@Comment{jabref-entrytype-v2: person: req[Name|PERSON_NAME] opt[Googlescholar|EXTERNAL;Orcid|EXTERNAL]}`\r\n  - `@Comment{jabref-entrytype-v2: customizedtype: req[title;author;date] opt[year;month;publisher]}`\r\n  - Note that is not necessary to provide properties to already known field names. It is not possible to overwrite field properties (currently). Reason: Parsing logic at [/src/main/java/org/jabref/model/entry/field/FieldFactory.java#L76](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/d81d37faaddd45257e445f1978f97994043dd2d4/src/main/java/org/jabref/model/entry/field/FieldFactory.java#L76). You can think of changing this in your implementation. But take this as optional.\r\n  - New field properties can be added by passing them at [/src/main/java/org/jabref/model/entry/field/FieldFactory.java#L90](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/d81d37faaddd45257e445f1978f97994043dd2d4/src/main/java/org/jabref/model/entry/field/FieldFactory.java#L90)\r\n   ```java\r\n      .orElse(new UnknownField(fieldName));\r\n   ```\r\n  - Note that I added `-v2`, because the new format is NOT backwards-compatible with the old one and thus JabRef users might loose data if they switch versions back and forth.\r\n  - Note that there might be no field properties given. See discussion at https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3251.\r\n  - The proposal is NOT backwards-compatible. We can also come up with a completely new format. Nested JSON. Then, the string after `jabref-entrytype-v2:` needs to be forwarded to a JSON parser. \r\n\r\nHints:\r\n\r\n1. IDE hint: By holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and then click with the mouse on an identifier, you can navigate to the usage of a class, method, etc.\r\n2. IDE hint: By holding<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd>, you can search all text occurrences. Helpful to find some code.\r\n3. Please try to understand the current UI\r\n4. Add a sketch of the new UI - maybe this helps to understand the issue more\r\n5. Define the new data format for writing `jabref-entrytype`\r\n6. Add test cases for the new data format. The tests should go into [org.jabref.logic.exporter.MetaDataSerializerTest](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/d81d37faaddd45257e445f1978f97994043dd2d4/src/test/java/org/jabref/logic/exporter/MetaDataSerializerTest.java#L31). \r\n7. A new test class for [org.jabref.logic.importer.util.MetaDataParser](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/d81d37faaddd45257e445f1978f97994043dd2d4/src/main/java/org/jabref/logic/importer/util/MetaDataParser.java#L32). Needs to be created. This can be done with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd> and then <kbd>Enter</kbd>. `parseCustomEntryType` should be tested.\r\n8. You can also work on `org.jabref.model.entry.field.FieldFactoryTest`, because `org.jabref.model.entry.field.FieldFactory` is called in `MetaDataParser`.\r\n9. Other tests are in [org.jabref.model.entry.BibEntryTypesManagerTest](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/d81d37faaddd45257e445f1978f97994043dd2d4/src/test/java/org/jabref/model/entry/BibEntryTypesManagerTest.java#L158)\r\n11. More tests should go into [org.jabref.logic.exporter.BibtexDatabaseWriterTest](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/d81d37faaddd45257e445f1978f97994043dd2d4/src/test/java/org/jabref/logic/exporter/BibtexDatabaseWriterTest.java#L69)\r\n12.

Reason: the incoming object might be a \"constant\" object.

You could probably either overload the constructor or change the constructor to only accepts the name as a String. I prefer the first one: To provide a field for one constructor and overload the constructor with a String, but the `toField` method has to be retained.\r\n", "Case 1: This is OK. In addition, a) the field name should be shown and b) show the current field properties.\r\n\r\nReason for b): You rendering in \"Required and optional fields\" does not show the properties. This is OK, because GUI coding is hard. However, there should be a change for the average user to check the field properties. Currently, they are only visible in the code.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/assets/1366654/4dbfac29-b23b-489f-ae3f-d3b5dfe9c5a3)\r\n\r\nCase 2: \r\n\r\n- Checking if it is a standard field: Do not duplicate \"semantics\" of code. Please use `org.jabref.model.entry.field.FieldFactory#parseField(java.lang.String)`: `boolean isStandardField = FieldFactory.parseField(name) instanceOf StandardField;`. I read from your  code that you already have an instance of Field at hand. Thus, you can just use `instanceof` there. Note that I could not provide the full code, because `fieldsForAdding` is IMHO the list of all fields available in the combo box. We are talking about the place where a new entry is added.\r\n- The screenshot is strange. It is \"CitationKey\", which should also be forbidden, because it is an InternalField (add it to your thinking of case 1).\r\n- Let's discuss concrete examples. Then, you also have a base for test cases. Let's assume the user wants to add `exampleCustomField`. The user selected properties `DATE` and `DOI`. This is a strange selection. I think, you are beginning to discuss, which FieldProperties are mutually exclusive. I think, `org.jabref.model.entry.field.StandardField` is a good list of field property combinations. Nearly none of the fields have more than one property. Only exception `FieldProperty.EXTERNAL, FieldProperty.VERBATIM` for `URL` - and `UserSpecificCommentField`: `FieldProperty.COMMENT, FieldProperty.MULTILINE_TEXT`. --> And more thinking: `FILE_EDITOR` and `EXTERNAL` implies `VERBATIM`. `COMMENT` implies `MULTILINE_TEXT`. Thus, I **change** the specification: Allow the user to select **at most one** field property. If the Field is generated, AND the property is `FILE_EDITOR`, `EXTERNAL`, `COMMENT`, then add the implied property **at the end of the viewModel**, which is `org.jabref.gui.preferences.customentrytypes.FieldViewModel#toField`.\r\n\r\nCase 3: Correct.\r\n\r\n", "@DinjerChang @eric052199 are you still on it, or can I move this back to \"free to take\"?", "Yes, you could move it back.

This would involve using backdrop-filter: blur() along with transparency and shadow to create a visually engaging interface. Additionally, it should maintain responsiveness across all screen sizes and blend seamlessly with both light and dark themes.\n--\n\n## \uD83D\uDCDA Additional Context\n- This improvement can:\n\n- Enhance the aesthetic appeal and modernize the UI.\n\n- Make the navbar stand out without being too intrusive.\n\n- Encourage longer user engagement by offering a more polished experience.\n\n",

Should we create a PR for each converter individually, e.g., for the **Malicious Question Generator**, or should we wait until all the above attack modules from Project Moonshot are finished before submitting the PR? \r\n\r\nSubmitting separate PRs might allow for more focused reviews and quicker feedback on each converter, but I'll defer to your preference on how you'd like to handle it.\r\n\r\n2. **Regarding Violent Durian**, I initially thought it would function more like a strategy inside the Red Teaming Orchestrator. Upon further review, I see that it operates more dynamically by **convincing the LLM (prompt target) to take on a criminal persona**. The setup involves a **multiturn agent** that manipulates the LLM into gradually adopting the identity of a criminal (e.g., Zodiac Killer, Ted Bundy) and generating responses as if it were that persona.\r\n\r\nThis contrasts with a standard converter that mostly modifies the input prompt. In this case, **Violent Durian** seems to guide a multi-turn conversation, progressively influencing the LLM to respond unethically and act in alignment with the persona. \r\n\r\nFor example, I plan to integrate this behavior into the Red Teaming Orchestrator by dynamically selecting a criminal persona and applying it to the conversation objective in the YAML-based attack strategy, adapting the YAML to fit the Violent Durian use case.\r\n\r\nIf you have a different approach or best practices to suggest, I???d be happy to incorporate them. Looking forward to your thoughts \uD83D\uDE00", "Yes, individual PRs are preferable, unless you're reusing pieces. Even then it's probably better to have them one after the other.\r\n\r\nYour idea to use it on the orchestrator level makes sense. Essentially, this would be a new custom attack strategy.", "> > @KutalVolkan go ahead!

      "description" : "### System information\n\nTop of tree.\n\n### What is the problem that this feature solves?\n\nCurrently, ONNX???s `shape_inference.infer_shapes` API performs both type and shape inference simultaneously. Type inference is guaranteed in a valid model, but shape inference is on \"best effort\" basis. For some operators (e.g., GridSample, Gather, Reshape, Where, etc), shape inference may fail due to incomplete or complex shape logic, even when type inference could succeed. \nThis tight coupling prevents users from recovering type information when shape inference is unsupported or fails. For example, when users attempt to inject cast nodes or quantize nodes and propagate the type information downstream.\n\n\n**Request:**\nPlease consider adding an option to ONNX???s shape inference API to:\n- Run type inference independently of shape inference, so that type information can be propagated even when shape inference fails or is not implemented for an operator.\n- Alternatively, relax the requirement that shape inference must succeed for type inference to run.\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Enables users and downstream tools to recover and validate type information in more models, improving robustness and usability.\n- Reduces manual workarounds (such as manually setting types for affected nodes).\n- Makes ONNX models more portable and easier to analyze, even when shape logic is incomplete.\n\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n1. Create a separate function to support only type inference `infer_types` (preferable) \n2. Add boolean argument `check_shape=True` to the existing `infer_shapes` API (renaming the function is advisable in this case, `infer_shapes_and_types` or similar).\n\n\n### Describe the feature\n\nDecouple type inference from shape inference.\n\n\n### Will this influence the current api (Y/N)?\n\nDepends on the alternative selected. \nCan maintain backwards compatiblity.\n\n### Feature Area\n\nshape_inference\n\n### Are you willing to contribute it (Y/N)\n\nNone\n\n### Notes\n\nRelated issues https://github.com/onnx/onnx/issues/4934",

Any specific example to illustrate what you would like to see?\n\n@gramalingam Type inference is typically much simpler than shape inference, and less error-prone. \nShape inference may fail for dynamic shapes and for data-dependent shape scenarios, but type-inference is always very straight forward.\nI would like to be able to modify the input types for a graph and propagate the type information to the graph's outputs reliably.\nThe main consumer I have in mind is the newly release ModelOpt AutoCast tool ([Readme](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-Model-Optimizer/blob/main/docs/source/guides/8_autocast.rst\n)). Specifically, I'd like to avoid shape-related failures in this [pass](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-Model-Optimizer/blob/main/modelopt/onnx/autocast/precisionconverter.py#L178-L187). The shape inference failures are rare, and typically caused by model issues or wrong input shape, but I'd really like to be able to simplify this to handle only type-inference.\nRegardless, I think this is a long-standing anomaly that type inference and shape inference are coupled together.", "@galagam : conceptually, yes, having a separate type inference (without shape inference) could help, especially to bypass bugs in shape inference. Inference in ONNX involves both general inference logic, as well as operation-specific inference logic. Separating the type inference logic from shape inference logic in the operator-specific logic can be tedious work. If you have any suggestions on how to do that, would appreciate them.\n\nThe simplest approach I can see is to use the fact that the design allows for separate exceptions for type-inference errors and shape-inference errors. So, one possibility is that in the generic inference algorithm, we can catch shape-inference errors, and ignore them, and keep going ... this can be done [here](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/88d94b88fefffa98bc74cbae6fa63798d0d9c9f5/onnx/shape_inference/implementation.cc#L515) I think.", "BTW, have you tried setting `strict_mode=False` ? May give a partial workaround.

We just need to be clear on the design and backwards compatibility. \nThat is: \n- We can only update defs.cc, never old.cc, right? \n- Does it mean we create a new version for every single op with this change?\n- What happens if user calls `infer_types` but the node does not have `infer_types` defined (older opset or any other reason)? I'd suggest fall back on infer_shapes, but I'm not sure it's the best approach because it can have unexpected side effects.\nIn any case, I suggest we keep an pin in that and explore extending `error_mode` first." ],

Yes it is true that the JDKs can get accumulated over time when you use Ballerina distributions that depend on different JDKs.

We have already included Ballerina in Homebrew https://ballerina.io/downloads/installation-options/#install-via-homebrew\r\n3.

      "description" : "I thought it would be great to have a formatting line (an optional first line in the input file of the `file` parameter) which tells iai-callgrind how to interpret the following lines. If absent, each line is interpreted as a single benchmark, as before. If present, this line would provide more control over the creation process of the benchmark per line. The following example shows the basic idea for a file `benches/inputs` (the file name doesn't matter)\r\n\r\n```text\r\n# format:iai-callgrind field:id delimiter:\";\" field:description delimiter:\";\" field:data option:skip-if:\"^[ ]*#\"\r\nid_from_file;Some description I want to see in the DESCRIPTION field of the output;11111111111\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the first line starts with `# format:iai-callgrind`, we interpret this line as a formatting line. There can be different types of data which are described by `field:TYPE` key-value pairs.\r\n\r\nThe `id` type is appended to the existing ID which comes from `#[benches:ID]`. The line number could still be appended with the line number. For example `#[benches:some_id(file = ...]` with the above file content would result in a benchmark with the id: `some_id_id_from_file__line_1`\r\n\r\nThe `description` type adds the possibility to use this field as the description instead of the default, which is derived from the data field. So, instead of `String :: from(11111111111)` the description would be `Some description I want to see in the DESCRIPTION field of the output`. The DESCRIPTION is shown in the headline of the output of the benchmark as in `benchmark_file::group_name::function_name id:DESCRIPTION`. I also thought about some options for this field like `field:description:append` to append the description to the default instead of replacing it. Other possible options could be `prepend` and `replace` (the default).\r\n\r\nThe `data` field contains the actual benchmark data and is the only mandatory field and the only field which is actually passed to the benchmark function as `String` as in\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[library_benchmark]\r\n#[benches::some_id(file = \"benches/inputs\")]\r\nfn benchmark_function(data: String) -> String {\r\n    data\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also think it's useful to be able to skip comment lines, so it's possible to describe the intention of the benchmark in the file itself. The `option` field can provide such behavioural changes. `skip-if:\"REGEX\"` was just one idea, the parameters for this field can be enhanced over time.\r\n\r\nFinally, the `delimiter` is used to describe the delimiter between the different fields.",

For example, it could accept a function with the signature `fn() -> impl Iterator<Item = ARGS>` where `ARGS` is a tuple matching the benchmark function's input. Then iai takes an input, starts cachegrind, runs the function with the input, pauses cachegrind, and loops until the iterator is empty.", "@tgross35 Thanks for your suggestion. I think both, `iter` and `file` have their advantages. The problem with an iterator is, that in contrast to `file` and `args` an iterator needs to be traversed at runtime in the benchmark harness instead of the runner. Now, each benchmark case is not a separate/hard-coded function anymore which has side-effects that need to be considered. This is a problem for example when running dhat with the default entry point. The allocation (and iteration) of the iterator happens during the setup and therefore is included in the metrics, which I definitely don't want. The code needed to setup the benchmarks should not have an influence on the benchmark metrics or at least be insignificant. However, I am confident it's a solvable problem so I started working on the iterator." ],

If absent, each line is interpreted as a single benchmark, as before. If present, this line would provide more control over the creation process of the benchmark per line.",
      "validationOrRequirement" : "If the first line starts with `# format:iai-callgrind`, we interpret this line as a formatting line. There can be different types of data which are described by `field:TYPE` key-value pairs. The `id` type is appended to the existing ID which comes from `#[benches:ID]`. The line number could still be appended with the line number. For example `#[benches:some_id(file = ...]` with the above file content would result in a benchmark with the id: `some_id_id_from_file__line_1`. The `description` type adds the possibility to use this field as the description instead of the default, which is derived from the data field. So, instead of `String :: from(11111111111)` the description would be `Some description I want to see in the DESCRIPTION field of the output`. The DESCRIPTION is shown in the headline of the output of the benchmark as in `benchmark_file::group_name::function_name id:DESCRIPTION`. I also thought about some options for this field like `field:description:append` to append the description to the default instead of replacing it. Other possible options could be `prepend` and `replace` (the default). The `data` field contains the actual benchmark data and is the only mandatory field and the only field which is actually passed to the benchmark function as `String` as in\n\n```rust\n#[library_benchmark]\n#[benches::some_id(file = \"benches/inputs\")]\nfn benchmark_function(data: String) -> String {\n    data\n}\n``` The `option` field can provide such behavioural changes. `skip-if:\"REGEX\"` was just one idea, the parameters for this field can be enhanced over time. Finally, the `delimiter` is used to describe the delimiter between the different fields.",
      "attemptedFixes" : "Support format specification in files of the `file` parameter",
      "otherNotes" : "Would it be better instead to support arbitrary input generators like suggested in https://github.com/iai-callgrind/iai-callgrind/issues/326? For example, it could accept a function with the signature `fn() -> impl Iterator<Item = ARGS>` where `ARGS` is a tuple matching the benchmark function's input. Then iai takes an input, starts cachegrind, runs the function with the input, pauses cachegrind, and loops until the iterator is empty. @tgross35 Thanks for your suggestion. I think both, `iter` and `file` have their advantages. The problem with an iterator is, that in contrast to `file` and `args` an iterator needs to be traversed at runtime in the benchmark harness instead of the runner. Now, each benchmark case is not a separate/hard-coded function anymore which has side-effects that need to be considered. This is a problem for example when running dhat with the default entry point. The allocation (and iteration) of the iterator happens during the setup and therefore is included in the metrics, which I definitely don't want. The code needed to setup the benchmarks should not have an influence on the benchmark metrics or at least be insignificant. However, I am confident it's a solvable problem so I started working on the iterator.",

Could you give me some tips?\r\n\r\nThere's a few things you can do:\r\n\r\n1. `python3 runtests.py name_of_your_file` just runs your test (note that `name_of_your_file` doesn't include `.srctree`)\r\n2. `--no-capture` argument to `runtests.py` makes it much easier to use in a debugger\r\n3. `--no-cleanup` and `--no-cleanup-sharedlibs` don't delete the files after the test finishes. That means you can change directory into `TEST_TMP` and import/run the modules yourself after the test has finished.", "There's also a combined `--debug` option in `runtests.py` that enables everything that makes `pdb` usable.

That cuts off external pdb runs. What I'd do is run it once with `--no-cleanup` and then use the resulting test directory to do your own Cython runs in it, as @da-woods suggested above. That could possibly be improved by detecting pdb and injecting a pdb command into the `setup.py` build runs of srctree tests automatically, but that might also be surprising and unwanted, so not sure it's worth implementing. Again, I'd just run the commands manually.", "Hi! I would like to contribute to this, is it still open?", "> Hi!

So look at trying to create some a loop with some observable and reliable behaviour that involves `break` and `continue`. Follow the style of the existing tests in the file - these you Python's doctest module.\r\n\r\nYou can run that individual testcase with `python3 runtests.py \"run[.]parallel\". The `--no-capture` argument may be useful if you want to put breakpoints in Cython's code to check if you're reaching the right lines.\r\n\r\nThere's no need to compile/install Cython - just clone the repository.", "So I have a few questions:\r\n\r\n1) I noticed that on Pycharm, I am getting red lines underneath parallel, prange, threadid as shown in the picture.

I'm going through the cython documentation to learn cython but are there any other webpages/resources that I should also study to complete this task?\r\n", "1. Probably normal that PyCharm can't find it. I'm not 100% sure though because I don't use PyCharm.\r\n2. No special venv needed really.

No need to edit runtests.py - just use it to run the tests with the command line I suggested. \r\n4. I don't think there's huge amounts of relevant documentation beyond the Cython documentation.

Forked and cloned the repository, then searched the codebase for `readline` usage to find the core input handling logic.\n2.  Identified `useKeypress.ts` (for raw keypress events) and `InputPrompt.tsx` (for input logic) as the key files.\n3.  To see what the application receives, I temporarily modified the code to log every keypress event to a `debug.log` file.\n4.  **Key Finding:** My initial debugging proved that on a default macOS Terminal, `Shift+Enter` sends the exact same sequence (`\\r`) as a regular `Enter` press, making the two indistinguishable.\n\n### Attempted Fix & The Final Discovery\n\nBased on the initial finding, I attempted a code-only fix by teaching the application to listen for a different key combination, `Shift+Down`, which often sends a unique sequence on other terminals.\n\n1. The Code I Tested\nI modified `useKeypress.ts` to listen for the `Shift+Down` sequence (`\\x1b[1;2B`) and `InputPrompt.tsx` to handle a `key.shift` flag.\n\n```typescript\n// In useKeypress.ts, I added a check:\nif (key.sequence === '\\x1b[1;2B') {\n  key.name = 'return';\n  key.shift = true;\n}\n```\n```typescript\n// In InputPrompt.tsx, I added the key.shift check:\nif (key.ctrl || key.meta || key.shift || charBefore === '\\\\' || key.paste) {\n  // ... newline logic\n}\n```\n\n2. The Result: It Also Failed\nThis proof-of-concept did not work. To understand why, I used the `cat` command to see what my terminal was actually sending when I pressed `Shift+Down`.\nFinal Proof: The terminal sent `^[[B`, which is the standard escape code for a plain Cursor Down key.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis investigation leads to a definitive conclusion: the default macOS Terminal is more limited than anticipated. It appears to strip the `Shift` modifier information from both the `Enter` key and the arrow keys, making a code-only fix for a `Shift+Key` newline combination unfeasible on this specific platform, although i think this might work on other platforms which by default register shift + down as '\\x1b[1;2B' but i cant really test it.\n\nThis might explain why `Ctrl+J` is a common suggested alternative, as it sends a universal newline character (`\\n`) that doesn't rely on modifier key parsing.\n\nAs this is my first contribution, my analysis could be wrong, and I apologize for the detailed-but-failed attempt. Given these findings, what is the desired path forward? Any information from the internal `b.corp.google.com` link about how other terminals are supported would still be very helpful.\n\nThank you for your time and guidance.", "Just to add, I personally use the Warp Terminal on Mac.

As I mentioned before that grammar fix\n2. play now - open\n3. I noticed that cards are uneven due to text length and it can be fixed by adding consistent height, low contrast on the play now button.\n4. next I would like to tell about \"Text Clarity\" there \"View all events memories here\" , I want to change it to \"Explore past events and highlights\" or something similar\n5. And lastly if it's not ready for mobile responsive, I would make sure the layout is mobile responsive\n\n@VAIBHAVBABELE can you consider it now ?\n\n", "Please assign it to me" ],

For example, when I'm writing a [query module for database export](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/100), I'm actually creating a `JSON` file with a list of nodes and relationships. Therefore, I have to reach every label, property, etc. of each `Vertex` and `Edge`. I would like to be able to just add properties as a list to my properties key, but then `mgp.Vertex.properties` is not `JSON` serializable. I solved this by going through all properties and creating new dictionary, but I think that the right place for this code would be inside mgp and not query module. Since we're going to create new utility modules similar to the export one, this feature may come in handy.\r\n\r\n",

      "description" : "### Is your feature request related to a problem?\n\n- [x] Yes, it is related to a problem\n\n### Describe the feature you'd like\n\n### \uD83C\uDF1F Feature Description\n\nThis feature focuses on a critical enhancement of the initial **Classification Prompt**. The goal is to refine the prompt's logic to be much stricter and more precise, ensuring that the DevRel agent is only triggered for queries that are explicitly its responsibility. This involves improving the instructions the LLM uses to decide whether a message requires agent intervention.\n\nAdditionally, this task includes a secondary objective to review all other existing prompts (`agent_prompt`, `summarization_prompt`, etc.) for clarity, efficiency, and alignment with the latest system architecture.\n\n### \uD83D\uDD0D Problem Statement\n\nCurrently, the classification prompt may be too broad, leading to the DevRel agent responding to general conversations or messages where it's not needed. This can create several issues:\n\n1.  **Unnecessary Invocations**: The agent wastes resources processing irrelevant messages.\n2.  **User Annoyance**: An AI assistant that injects itself into every conversation can be perceived as intrusive or unhelpful.\n3.  **Lack of Precision**: The agent may misinterpret context and provide answers when it should remain silent, degrading the quality of the user experience.\n\nThe core problem is a lack of **strict activation boundaries** for the agent.\n\n### \uD83C\uDFAF Expected Outcome\n\n1.  **Modified Classification Prompt**: The `Classification Prompt` will be rewritten to include new, strict rules. The agent should **only** be activated if one of the following conditions is met:\n      * The user **explicitly tags or mentions** the DevRel AI bot (e.g., `@Devr.AI, can you help?`).\n      * The user's query is a direct question about the project, community, contribution process, or a technical issue clearly related to the repository (e.g., \"How do I set up the development environment?\", \"I'm getting a build error.\").\n      * The prompt will explicitly instruct the model to **ignore** general chatter, greetings, and conversations between other users unless the bot is tagged.\n2.  **Reduced False Positives**: After implementation, there should be a measurable decrease in the number of times the agent responds to irrelevant conversations.\n3.  **Improved Prompt Suite**: A brief review of all other system prompts will be conducted, with minor enhancements made for clarity and conciseness.\n\n### Record\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\n- [ ] I want to work on implementing this feature",

However, Second Life only supports a maximum texture resolution of 1024??1024.

This appears to be a result of convention or copy-paste, not a performance-driven choice.\n\nFor instance, in `CreateRelease`, the `RepositoryRelease` struct is relatively large (~15+ fields), but most of its fields are pointers themselves. As such, passing it by value would have negligible performance impact in typical API usage. Moreover, value semantics would improve clarity, especially for required arguments that aren't modified.\n\nTo improve API design consistency and safety, we should:\n\n- Audit method signatures that accept pointer structs as input\n- Change them to accept values when:\n\n  - The input is required (not optional)\n\n  - The function does not modify the input\n\n- Optionally introduce dedicated input structs for specific operations (e.g. `CreateRepositoryRelease` with only the fields needed for creation)\n\nNote: This would be a breaking change and should be handled carefully, possibly across multiple PRs.\n\n_Originally posted by @gmlewis in https://github.com/google/go-github/pull/3636#discussion_r2228429223_\n            ",

It seems the goal of this optimization is to simplify the comparisons involving ANY or SOME operators when the left hand is constant and the right side contains a constant that can evaluate the operation to be True.\n\nTo achieve this, I was considering adding a function called FoldAnyWithConst in [fold_constants.opt](https://github.com/ahuangg/cockroach/blob/master/pkg/sql/opt/norm/rules/fold_constants.opt) \n```\n# FoldAnyWithConst simplifies a scalar ANY operation when the left side is constant\n# and the right side contains a constant that can determine the result, like this:\n# 0.1 < ANY (c0, 0.4) can be simplified since 0.1 < 0.4 is True\n[FoldAnyWithConst, Normalize]\n(AnyScalar\n    $left:* & (IsConstValueOrGroupOfConstValues $left)\n    $right:* &\n    (Let\n        ($result $ok):(FoldAnyWithConst (OpName) $left $right) $ok\n    )\n)\n=>\n$result\n```\nthen doing the actual implementation of the function in [fold_constants_funcs.go](https://github.com/ahuangg/cockroach/blob/master/pkg/sql/opt/norm/fold_constants_funcs.go) in a similar fashion to how the other functions are implemented in the file. \n\nPlease let me know what you think, feedback is appreciated.\n", "That sounds like the correct approach to me.\n\nOne thing we'll have to be mindful about is `NULL` values. We should be find as long as we only fold to `true`, and never `false`.\n\n```sql\nSELECT 1 < ANY (2, NULL), 1 < ANY(0, NULL);\n--   ?column? | ?column?\n-- -----------+-----------\n--      t     |   NULL\n-- (1 row)\n```", "Seeing as this issue has been inactive for a month - can this be assigned to me?\n\n@DrewKimball @mgartner ", "Hi @DrewKimball and @rytaft,\n\nI'd like to work on this issue.

Create/modify `config.toml` with `max_iterations = 1000`\n2. Install development version: `pip install openhands -e .`\n3. Run: `openhands -n vscode-runtime`\n4. Observe that execution stops at 500 iterations despite config setting\n\n## Additional Context\n- The config file is definitely being read (other settings are applied)\n- This affects workflows where longer sessions are needed\n\n---\n*Reported by: OpenHands-Claude (AI Assistant)*",

See https://medium.com/@stefanos.kalandaridis/bash-ing-your-network-f7069ab7c5f4 for a decent primer on how it works.\r\n\r\nThis is among the weakest of healthcheck options in that it simply verifies that SOMETHING is able to accept a tcp connection on the API port. It says nothing about the health of the gRPC stack or any in-memory or on-disk state. It also says nothing about DERP, which could maybe be interrogated via `/dev/udp` but doing so requires knowing a valid message to send that will elicit a response and not leak resources along the way. I haven't configured a derp check myself.\r\n\r\nThis isn't a high-quality replacement for the stronger checks proposed in other comments... but it's start that allows monitoring frameworks to check that the API is at least healthy enough to complete a 3-way TCP handshake in image-flavors that have bash available.", "> This enables using /dev/tcp to check if the API port is open via something like (assuming you're using the default API port): `bash -c 'cat < /dev/null > /dev/tcp/localhost/8080'`\n\nNo **bash** nor **sh** in `headscale/headscale:v0.25`", "What I saw in other go programs is a health check made in main of the go program.\nSo you can make use of http client.", "Hey all.

      "description" : "### Proposal summary\n\nWe like to extend the existing evaluation metrics to include a new metric called \"Trajectory Accuracy\". Esentially we are evaluating ReAct style agents by reasoning about the sequence of actions taken and their outcomes. Based on the paper ???ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models??? https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629. You can also see the Langchain implementation here:\n- https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/evaluation/langchain.evaluation.agents.trajectory_eval_chain.TrajectoryEvalChain.html\n- https://github.com/langchain-ai/agentevals/tree/main/python/agentevals/trajectory\n\nExample of an existing judge metric (Hallucination) is defined here:\n- Docs: https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/evaluation/metrics/hallucination\n- Docs Code: https://github.com/comet-ml/opik/blob/main/apps/opik-documentation/documentation/fern/docs/evaluation/metrics/hallucination.mdx\n- Python SDK: https://github.com/comet-ml/opik/tree/main/sdks/python/src/opik/evaluation/metrics/llm_judges/hallucination\n- Python Examples: https://github.com/comet-ml/opik/blob/main/sdks/python/examples/metrics.py\n- Frontend: https://github.com/comet-ml/opik/blob/main/apps/opik-frontend/src/constants/llm.ts\n\nIdeally this is implemented as an LLM-as-a-judge. Expectation is the new judge is added to the frontend for using LLM-as-a-judge from the UI (Online Evaluation tab) as well as in the Python SDK. The appropriate docs needs to be updated and a video attached of the metric working.\n\nReturn should be float (0-1), and if its using LLM as a eval then should also contain a \"reason/explanation\"\n\n### Motivation\n\nI would like to see more robust set of metrics and evaluations based on recent research.",

Quick question before I move forward\nWould you prefer I\n    Implement a new setting to auto-hide the ???More Videos??? popup that appears on pause or fullscreen exit,\n    OR\n    Investigate if the extension already tries to block it, and it's just not working as expected?\nThe reason I???m asking is ??? I tested on both Firefox (with the extension) and Chrome (without the extension), and in both cases, I didn???t see the popup appear when pausing or exiting fullscreen.\n\nSo I???m wondering if this is:\n    A browser-specific issue\n    A YouTube experiment (A/B test)\n    Or something already handled, but not consistently\nLet me know which direction you'd like me to take", "It's possible the extension already tries to block it, but I looked through the settings and didn't see an option for it. The extension on the Chrome web store actually seems to show a picture indicating that it should be removed with the \"Related videos\" setting.\nhttps://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/improve-youtube-%F0%9F%8E%A7-for-yo/bnomihfieiccainjcjblhegjgglakjdd?pli=1\nSecond picture, bottom left\n\nI've been having an (unrelated) issue where the forced video playback speed and playback speed adjustments haven't been working most of the time. I haven't found a specific situation that causes it or a solution. But the youtube playback speed settings still work, just not my shortcuts through the extension or any playback speed above 2x. This is to say that the extension hasn't been working perfectly for me, so this may just be a me issue.\n\nAre there troubleshooting steps I can take to see if both issues are due to an out-of-date firmware or something? Uninstall and reinstall the extension maybe?", "Hide pause overlay was turned off (it's on now) and hide cards was turned on. I still have the same \"more videos\" popup when I pause. If that's not expected then the issue is likely on my end, like I said my playback speed settings haven't been working. I didn't want to make a separate bug thread unless I knew it wasn't an issue with my computer. Should I make another thread about both these setting not seeming to work for me? Or is there something I can try to fix it?\n\nThank you a ton for your help!", "hi and thanks @Gurunath-S  @GorillaOnWeekends  \n\nah, reading your new answer @GorillaOnWeekends, \ni only know that popup when using the embedded player(?)\nso then `general` : `embedded `: `hide pause overlay` helps\n\n( Taxonomy is important for this project. We started collecting some tags in our [menu structure](https://github.com/code-charity/youtube/tree/master/menu/skeleton-parts), so that we can use them to improve our feature-search later.\n\n(also, when somebody disables/disabled related videos in the sidebar, of course they might want to hide the \"pause overlay\"  too.  \nEspecially if they use our pop out player feature. A lot of logic could meaningfully be added)\n\nSince when have you been using the extension? Shortcuts should work.  Permanent speed with the music exception could be slow and was updated a few some days ago with v4.1320.   Might be great if you can check the browser console for related issues.  Would like to rule out any broader / timing issues.\n", "I've been using the extension for a couple years now I think? I'm on v4.1320. I have this issue regardless of if I have the force on music turned on or off. Another issue that seemed to start at the same time is that I cant pause a video with \"k\" or use the arrow keys or J and L to skip around the video until I click to pause and play the video. Almost as if I was tabbed out and those YouTube shortcuts wouldn't work until I was tabbed back in.\nI had to google what a browser console was, these were in there:\n\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'parentElement')\n    at ImprovedTube.improvedtubeYoutubeButtonsUnderPlayer (appearance.js:505:22)\n    at ImprovedTube.ytElementsHandler (functions.js:98:8)\n    at ImprovedTube.childHandler (functions.js:10:7)\n    at ImprovedTube.observer.MutationObserver.observe.childList (init.js:13:18)\nthis.onpause     functions.js:329\ninitializing selectors     ryd.content-script.js:832\nObject     ryd.content-script.js:842 \n\nobserver method `dataChanged_` not defined\nthis.onpause     functions.js:329 \nskipping permanent speed, since speed was manually set differently for this video to:1.75, was it?     player.js:140\n\nI can paste the rest of the console here if you want/need it. I didn't wanna paste anything else in case there's sensitive/private stuff but if that's silly I'll send the rest. If I understood what any of that meant we might have a solution? That last part talks about skipping permanent speed", "Hi! @GorillaOnWeekends, iIregret the delay. Did you try \"hide pause overlay\"?\n\nI just removed a bug with the new key scene button, where it wasn't considered that it is possibly not neighboring to our screenshot button, which you disabled?\n" ],

      "repositoryName" : "RustPython/RustPython",
      "description" : "Though it will be sometimes blocked by rust side issues, don't worry!\nPlease just create PR about the broken test and and create issues related to the new bugs.\n\nIf you are new to updating cpython libraries, this guide will be useful:\nhttps://github.com/RustPython/RustPython/wiki/How-to-update-test-files\n\nWhen updating module Lib/X, please don't forget to also update Lib/test/test_X\n\nA few libraries doesn't need to be updated because CPython also kept it same as previous version. In that case, please leave a comment to let us mark it as done. Thank you!\n\nTips\n- To get specific version of CPython source code, e.g. try `git checkout v3.13.1` from CPython repository.\n- Please check #4064 for example. Not the entire changes but the each commits. One of the middle size example is https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython/commit/17e12dea1ec11b871a9e5d3a4a26e2f9ad83fde2 . Sometimes it can be really simple like https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython/pull/4064/commits/9571a68c01284191d4b18229694c303dad8992ff\n- Please create one PR for one library+test pair whenever possible. Once you stuck by dependencies, go to one of the dependency first and finish it before restarting the stuck one unless they become simpler to be updated at the same time. Normally adding more libraries make passing tests (a lot) harder.\n- To run tests, try `cargo run --features ssl -- -m test -v <test_name>`. e.g. If you changed `test_unicode.py`, `cargo run --features ssl -- -m test -v test_unicode`\n  - If it runs too slow, try to add `--release` like `cargo run --release --features ssl -- -m test -v test_unicode`\n\n\n# List of libraries\n- [ ] `__future__.py`\n  - Related test is  `test_future_stmt`\n- [x] _colorize  #5520\n- [ ] `_compression.py` \n- [ ] `_markupbase.py` \n- [x] `_osx_support.py` #5596\n- [ ] `_threading_local.py`\n- [ ] `_weakrefset.py`\n- [ ] `abc.py`\n  -

These must be filed via the bug report template.\n- [x] I have looked through the open issues for a duplicate request.\n\n### What's the problem this feature will solve?\n\nThe `timeout-minutes` property can be used to prevent run-away jobs from consuming all your allowed GitHub Actions runner minutes. [The default value is 360 minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idtimeout-minutes) (6 hours).\n\nExamples include scripts that accidentally hang or go into a loop, package managers which slow to a crawl when the registry is responding slowly, compilers that get stuck, or really anything else that can unexpectedly slow but not be constrained by its own timeout.\n\nI use this property on all jobs in all my workflows.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nI would like Zizmor to enforce or recommend the use of a `timeout-minutes` property on all jobs. This property is not strictly related to security, but I think it's such a useful configuration that it could be part of the \"pedantic\" or \"auditor\" persona.\n\nAt a stretch, you could suggest that a vulnerability in a workflow could allow an attacker to consume all your GitHub Actions minutes, and this would protect against that, but honestly it's more likely that `npm install` hangs and eats all your allowance.\n\n### Additional context\n\nJobs which call a reusable workflow (with `uses`) do not support `timeout-minutes`. The property needs to be defined in the jobs within the reusable workflow that it calls.",

Which one is more important probably ends up being context- and trigger-sensitive.)", "Hey @woodruffw , @johnbillion,\nI'd like to work on this issue. \nI'm relatively new to contributing to Python projects but have experience with CI/CD workflows and GitHub Actions. \nCould you point me to any existing checks that would be good examples to follow for implementing this feature?", "Hi @EmmanuelBerkowicz, thanks for offering your time.\n\nThis is a Rust project, not a Python project, just so you know \uD83D\uDE09 \n\n> Could you point me to any existing checks that would be good examples to follow for implementing this feature?\n\nAny of the pre-existing audits that use `audit_normal_job` would probably be a pretty good reference point -- see `UnpinnedImages` for example:\n\nhttps://github.com/zizmorcore/zizmor/blob/22958cba7586b81790213b908f23bf86f092d834/crates/zizmor/src/audit/unpinned_images.rs#L49\n\n(This audit _should_ be simpler than most -- it should be mostly a matter of checking `timeout_minutes` on each job and step, and raising a finding if any is missing or if the step(s) aren't transitively covered by the job.)\n\nThe docs here should also help a bit, although they're also a bit stale: https://docs.zizmor.sh/development/#adding-or-modifying-an-audit\n", "@woodruffw ,\nI knew that....

      "description" : "Currently our non-notebook examples are manually included in the examples webpage via custom `.rst` files in `tutorial/source/`.  As the number of examples increases, it would be better to follow [NumPyro's approach](http://pyro.ai/numpyro/examples/) and generate HTML pages automatically with [`sphinx_gallery`](https://sphinx-gallery.github.io/stable/index.html).  This would make examples easier to find and read, improve the design of the tutorial page, and declutter our tutorial folder on GitHub.  Many of the examples also contain extensive docstrings and comments that `sphinx_gallery` could automatically render in HTML.\r\n\r\nMore ambitiously, we might even aim to use `sphinx_gallery` to include tutorials in ReadTheDocs, simplifying our release process and removing the lag between new tutorials being added on GitHub and becoming visible on the examples web page.",

It's just how I'd do it, after I'd tested that all the new %install_* macros work on recipes where it matters and then I'd auto-replace in all other recipes and punt the checking of those to when they need a bump anyway.

      "comments" : [ "# :wave: Important: PLEASE READ :wave:\n\nThis issue has been labeled as a **good first issue** and is available for anyone to work on.\n\nIf this is your first time contributing to an open source project, some aspects of the development process may seem unusual, arcane, or some combination of both.\n\n1.  **You cannot \"claim\" issues.** People new to open source often want to \"claim\" or be assigned an issue before beginning work. The typical rationale is that people want to avoid wasted work in the event that someone else ends up working the issue. However, this practice is not effective in open source, as it often leads to \"issue squatting\", in which an individual asks to be assigned, is granted their request, and then never ends up working on the issue. Accordingly, you are encouraged to communicate your intent to address this issue, ideally by providing a rough outline as to how you plan to address the issue or asking clarifying questions, but, at the end of the day, we will take running code and rough consensus in order to move forward quickly.\n2.  **We have a very high bar for contributions.** We have very high standards for contributions and expect all contributions???whether new features, tests, or documentation???to be rigorous, thorough, and complete. Once a pull request is merged into stdlib, that contribution immediately becomes the collective responsibility of all maintainers of stdlib. When we merge code into stdlib, we are saying that we, the maintainers, commit to reviewing subsequent changes and making bugfixes to the code. Hence, in order to ensure future maintainability, this naturally leads to a higher standard of contribution.\n\nBefore working on this issue and opening a pull request, please read the project's [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md). These guidelines and the associated [development guide](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/docs/contributing/development.md) provide important information, including links to stdlib's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), license policy, and steps for setting up your local development environment.\n\nTo reiterate, we **strongly** encourage you to refer to our contributing guides **before** beginning work on this issue. Failure to follow our guidelines significantly decreases the likelihood that you'll successfully contribute to stdlib and may result in automatic closure of a pull request without review.\n\nSetting up your local development environment is a critical first step, as doing so ensures that automated development processes for linting, license verification, and unit testing can run prior to authoring commits and pushing changes. If you would prefer to avoid manual setup, we provide pre-configured [development containers](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/tree/develop/.devcontainer) for use locally or in GitHub Codespaces.\n\nWe place a high value on consistency throughout the stdlib codebase. We encourage you to closely examine other packages in stdlib and attempt to emulate the practices and conventions found therein.\n\n-   If you are attempting to contribute a new package, sometimes the best approach is to simply copy the contents of an existing package and then modify the minimum amount necessary to implement the feature (e.g., changing descriptions, parameter names, and implementation).\n-   If you are contributing tests, find a package implementing a similar feature and emulate the tests of that package.\n-   If you are updating documentation, examine several similar packages and emulate the content, style, and prose of those packages.\n\nIn short, the more effort you put in to ensure that your contribution looks and feels like stdlib???including variables names, bracket spacing, line breaks, etc???the more likely that your contribution will be reviewed and ultimately accepted. We encourage you to closely study the codebase **before** beginning work on this issue.\n\n:sparkles: Thank you again for your interest in stdlib, and we look forward to reviewing your future contributions. :sparkles:\n" ],

      "title" : "Effort to Compile on FreeBSD 14.2 - Summary of Issues & Final C++ Errors",
      "url" : "https://github.com/odoo/paper-muncher/issues/72",
      "repositoryName" : "odoo/paper-muncher",
      "description" : "Hello paper-muncher team,\n\nI am attempting to compile paper-muncher on a FreeBSD 14.2 system. I understand this is an experimental project and FreeBSD is not an officially supported target, but I wanted to document the journey and the final blockers in the hope that it might be useful for a future porting effort or for anyone else attempting this.\n\nAfter overcoming several dependency and build configuration hurdles, the process now fails during C++ compilation. This suggests the main remaining issues are within the C++ source code itself, primarily in the karm dependency, which seems to use modern C++ features that are not fully compatible with the Clang 18 toolchain on FreeBSD.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the steps taken, the workarounds required, and the final compilation errors.\nSystem Environment\n\n    Operating System: FreeBSD 14.2-RELEASE\n\n    Compiler: Clang 18.1.8 (installed via pkg install llvm18)\n\n    Core Dependencies Installed: python312, ninja, jq, oniguruma\n\nSummary of Porting Steps & Workarounds\n\nTo get the build process to the point of C++ compilation, the following issues had to be addressed:\n\n1. Core Dependencies\nThe following packages were required but are not explicitly listed for a FreeBSD environment:\n\n    python312\n\n    ninja\n\n    jq (for the cxx-collect rule)\n\n    The full llvm18 toolchain to provide clang-scan-deps and other utilities.\n\n2. Build System Configuration (cutekit)\nThe cutekit build system correctly identifies the OS as freebsd but has no rules to handle it, causing it to fail when resolving dependencies for system-specific implementations. I manually patched the following manifest.json files within the .cutekit/extern/ directory to include \"freebsd\" in their when.sys arrays:\n\n      \n// Patched the following manifest.json files to include \"freebsd\":\n\n// 1. To enable the base POSIX layer\n.cutekit/extern/skift-org/karm/src/impls/impl-posix/manifest.json\n\n// 2. To enable kevent async I/O (same as Darwin).\n.cutekit/extern/skift-org/karm/src/impls/impl-posix/kevent/manifest.json\n\n// 3. To satisfy the sandbox dependency (best-effort hack, as FreeBSD has Capsicum).\n.cutekit/extern/skift-org/karm/src/impls/impl-posix/darwin/manifest.json\n\n\n3. Hardcoded Compiler Flags\nThe build process generates commands with compiler flags that are incompatible with clang18 on FreeBSD. These flags appear to be dynamically generated by the build scripts, as they could not be found via grep in any source configuration files (project.json, mixins.py, etc.).\n\nThe problematic flags were:\n\n    -fmodules-reduced-bmi (unknown argument)\n\n    -std=gnu2y (invalid value)\n\nTo overcome this, a compiler wrapper script was created. This script intercepts calls to clang, clang++, and clang-scan-deps. It filters the arguments, removing -fmodules-reduced-bmi and replacing -std=gnu2y with -std=gnu17 before passing them to the real compiler. This was the only method that proved successful at correcting the dynamically generated build commands.\nFinal C++ Compilation Errors\n\nAfter implementing all the above workarounds, the build process starts and successfully compiles a significant number of files ([94/386]). However, it ultimately fails with a cascade of C++ errors originating from the karm library dependency.\n\nThe errors suggest a deep incompatibility related to modern C++ features, particularly constexpr, consteval, and advanced template metaprogramming, which the FreeBSD Clang version cannot handle as expected.\n<details>\n<summary><b>Click to expand the full compiler output</b></summary>\n\n      \n[43/292] host-amd64/vaev-css: cxx .cutekit/build/host-amd64-c77a6ee6-7ffb5091/vaev-css/__obj__/parser.cpp.o...\nFAILED: .cutekit/build/host-amd64-c77a6ee6-7ffb5091/vaev-css/__obj__/parser.cpp.o \n/usr/local/bin/clang++ -MD -MF .cutekit/build/host-amd64-c77a6ee6-7ffb5091/vaev-css/__obj__/parser.cpp.o.d -std=gnu++2c -Wall -Wextra -Werror -fcolor-diagnostics -fmodules-reduced-bmi -O3 -I.cutekit/extern/cute-engineering -I.cutekit/extern/cute-engineering/ce-libc/src -I.cutekit/extern/cute-engineering/ce-libm/src -I.cutekit/extern/cute-engineering/ce-mdi/src -I.cutekit/extern/cute-engineering/ce-stdcpp/src -I.cutekit/extern/skift-org/karm/src/assets -I.cutekit/extern/skift-org/karm/src/impls -I.cutekit/extern/skift-org/karm/src/libs -I.cutekit/generated -I.cutekit/generated/__aliases__ -Isrc -D__ck_abi_unknown__ -D__ck_abi_value=unknown -D__ck_arch_amd64__ -D__ck_arch_value=amd64 -D__ck_bits_unknown__ -D__ck_bits_value=unknown -D__ck_host__ -D__ck_sys_encoding_utf8__ -D__ck_sys_encoding_value=utf8 -D__ck_sys_freebsd__ -D__ck_sys_line_ending_lf__ -D__ck_sys_line_ending_value=lf -D__ck_sys_path_separator_slash__ -D__ck_sys_path_separator_value=slash -D__ck_sys_terminal_ansi__ -D__ck_sys_terminal_value=ansi -D__ck_sys_value=freebsd -D__ck_toolchain_clang__ -D__ck_toolchain_value=clang -D__ck_version_v0_2_2__ -D__ck_version_value=v0.2.2 @.cutekit/build/host-amd64-c77a6ee6-7ffb5091/vaev-css/__obj__/parser.cpp.o.modmap -c -o .cutekit/build/host-amd64-c77a6ee6-7ffb5091/vaev-css/__obj__/parser.cpp.o src/vaev-css/parser.cpp\nIn file included from src/vaev-css/parser.cpp:1:\nIn file included from .cutekit/extern/skift-org/karm/src/libs/karm-logger/logger.h:3:\nIn file included from .cutekit/extern/skift-org/karm/src/libs/karm-base/loc.h:3:\n.cutekit/extern/skift-org/karm/src/libs/karm-base/string.h:370:42: error: constexpr function never produces a constant expression [-Winvalid-constexpr]\n  370 | inline constexpr Karm::_Str<Karm::Utf16> operator\"\"_s16(char16_t const* buf, usize len) {\n      |                                          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n.cutekit/extern/skift-org/karm/src/libs/karm-base/string.h:371:13: note: reinterpret_cast is not allowed in a constant expression\n  371 |     return {reinterpret_cast<u16 const*>(buf), len};\n      |             ^\nIn file included from src/vaev-css/parser.cpp:1:\nIn file included from .cutekit/extern/skift-org/karm/src/libs/karm-logger/logger.h:4:\nIn file included from .cutekit/extern/skift-org/karm/src/libs/karm-cli/style.h:3:\nIn file included from .cutekit/extern/skift-org/karm/src/libs/karm-io/emit.h:4:\nIn file included from .cutekit/extern/skift-org/karm/src/libs/karm-io/fmt.h:16:\nIn file included from .cutekit/extern/skift-org/karm/src/libs/karm-io/text.h:3:\nIn file included from .cutekit/extern/skift-org/karm/src/libs/karm-io/traits.h:7:\nIn file included from .cutekit/extern/skift-org/karm/src/libs/karm-io/types.h:3:\nIn file included from .cutekit/extern/skift-org/karm/src/libs/karm-base/res.h:4:\nIn file included from .cutekit/extern/skift-org/karm/src/libs/karm-base/union.h:3:\n.cutekit/extern/skift-org/karm/src/libs/karm-meta/pack.h:17:32: error: expected '>'\n   17 |     if constexpr (Same<T, Ts...[Start]>)\n      |                                ^\n.cutekit/extern/skift-org/karm/src/libs/karm-meta/pack.h:17:23: note: to match this '<'\n   17 |     if constexpr (Same<T, Ts...[Start]>)\n      |                       ^\nfatal error: too many errors emitted, stopping now [-ferror-limit=]\n20 errors generated.\nninja: build stopped: subcommand failed.\nError: ninja: Process exited with code 1\n</details>\nConclusion\n\nIt appears that successfully compiling on FreeBSD would require:\n\n    Official Build System Support: Adding freebsd as a recognized target in the build configuration files and implementing a proper sandbox mechanism (e.g., using Capsicum).\n\n    C++ Code Portability: A significant review of the C++ code, especially within the karm dependency, to resolve incompatibilities with the Clang 18 toolchain or to remove/replace language features that are not yet universally supported.\n\nI hope this detailed report is useful.

      "url" : "https://github.com/AOSSIE-Org/Devr.AI/issues/97",
      "repositoryName" : "AOSSIE-Org/Devr.AI",
      "description" : "### Is your feature request related to a problem?\n\n- [x] Yes, it is related to a problem\n\n### Describe the feature you'd like\n\n## \uD83C\uDF1F Feature Description\n\nThis feature re-envisions the **`FAQ Handler`** as a specialized tool that leverages web search to answer general, high-level questions about the organization. It is designed to be the go-to tool for users seeking to understand the organization's mission, projects, and operational model.\n\nIt will be triggered when users ask questions like:\n\n  * *\"What is this organization all about?\"*\n  * *\"How does this organization work?\"*\n  * *\"What projects do you have?\"*\n  * *\"What are the main goals of Devr.AI?\"*\n\n## \uD83D\uDD0D Problem Statement\n\nNewcomers and potential contributors often have foundational questions about the organization itself before they dive into specific projects. Answering these questions manually is repetitive and inefficient. While a static knowledge base could work, it risks becoming outdated. A dynamic approach is needed to provide accurate, current information based on the organization's official public presence.\n\n## \uD83C\uDFAF Expected Outcome\n\nThe `FAQ Handler` will act as an automated public-facing representative, providing instant and accurate information about the organization. The expected outcome is a system that can:\n\n  * **Receive a general query** about the organization.\n  * **Dynamically search the web**, focusing on the organization's official website, blog, and public repositories.\n  * **Synthesize the search results** into a concise, easy-to-understand answer.\n  * **Provide source links** to allow users to explore the topic further.\n\n## \uD83D\uDCF7 Screenshots and Design Ideas\n\nThe workflow will be managed by the `FAQ Handler` tool, which will essentially be a specialized and intelligent implementation of a web search node.\n\n1.  **Trigger**: A user asks a general question.\n      * *User*: \"What kind of projects does this organization work on?\"\n2.  **Input**: The user's query is passed to the `FAQ Handler`.\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"query\": \"What projects does this organization have?\"\n    }\n    ```\n3.  **Action - Intelligent Web Search**:\n      * The tool formulates targeted search queries. For the example above, it would generate queries like:\n          * `\"Devr.AI open source projects\"`\n          * `\"Devr.AI GitHub repositories\"`\n          * `\"About Devr.AI projects\"`\n      * It executes these queries using the **Web Search Tool**.\n4.  **Synthesis**:\n      * The tool receives the top search results (snippets and URLs).\n      * It feeds this context to the LLM (Gemini) with a prompt like: *\"Based on the following search results, answer the user's question: 'What projects does this organization have?'\"*\n5.  **Output**: The tool returns a structured response containing the synthesized answer and the sources used.\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"status\": \"success\",\n      \"answer\": \"Devr.AI primarily focuses on creating tools for developer relations (DevRel), including AI-powered assistants for community engagement, issue triage, and onboarding. You can explore our main projects on our official website and GitHub page.\",\n      \"sources\": [\n        { \"title\": \"Devr.AI - Official Website\", \"url\": \"https://devr.ai/projects\" },\n        { \"title\": \"Devr.AI on GitHub\", \"url\": \"https://github.com/AOSSIE-Org/Devr.AI\" }\n      ]\n    }\n    ```\n6.  **Final Action**: The DevRel Agent formats this into a helpful message and sends it to the user.\n\n## \uD83D\uDCCB Additional Context\n\nBy aligning the **`FAQ Handler`** with the **Web Search** tool, we ensure a \"single source of truth\": the organization's own website and public materials. This approach is highly scalable and low-maintenance.\n\nTo make this tool effective, the primary task is not to build a database of FAQs, but to ensure that the organization's **website is well-structured and contains clear, findable answers** to these common questions. The success of the `FAQ Handler` is directly tied to the quality of the organization's public-facing content.\n\n### Record\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\n- [ ] I want to work on implementing this feature",

I'll elaborate on my workflow soon.", " **FAQ Handler Implementation:**\n\nI???ve carefully read through the problem statement and I believe this is a high-impact addition to your project.\n\nHere's how I plan to break this down and implement it, step by step:\n\n_Step 1: Question Intent Detection_\n\n- Build a simple NLP classifier (or use keyword-based matching) to determine if the user???s query is a general organizational FAQ (e.g., \"What projects do you have?\" or \"How does Devr.AI work?\").\n\n- This helps trigger the specialized FAQ Handler only for relevant questions.\n\n_Step 2: Dynamic Web Search Tool_\n\n- Use a web search API like:\n\n1. [SerpAPI](https://serpapi.com/) (Google/Bing wrapper),\n2. or DuckDuckGo Search API (open/free).\n\n- Fetch top 3???5 results focused on official sources.\n\n _Step 3: AI-Powered Synthesis_\n\n- Feed the top search results (title, snippet, URL) into an LLM like OpenAI GPT or Gemini using a structured prompt.\n\n- Example prompt:\n\n\"Based on the following search results, answer this user question in a concise and helpful way: 'What projects does Devr.AI work on?'\"\n\n_Step 4: Generate Final Response_\n\n- Parse the LLM output to:\n\n1. Return a clear, user-friendly answer.\n2. Include a list of cited sources.\n\n_Step 5: Integration into the Main Bot or Frontend_\n\n- Package this as a backend endpoint or a callable tool inside your chatbot/workflow agent.\n\n- Ensure it fails gracefully (e.g., no results or poor connectivity ??? fallback message).\n\n**\uD83D\uDD27 Why Me?**\nAlthough I???m new to contributing, I???m genuinely passionate about AI, developer tools, and meaningful open source work. I'm confident I can break this down into clean, maintainable code and deliver something the community will benefit from.\n\nI???d love your feedback or go-ahead to get started!\n\n@smokeyScraper \n\n", "yes @PrithvijitBose, we require this tool to be aligned in a similar way; just with a few changes.\nFor step 1, instead of any keyboard based matching, let there be a thinking node which can align the user's query to well aligned question.\nFor step 2, we already have Tavily as well as DuckDuckGo configured.\nRest flow is correct and we just need to ensure minimal nodes and minimizing calls to the model.\n\n@Rudra775 did a bit of work on this issue too, I think you both can work on this issue together? I'll let you know more on the design details.", "@smokeyScraper sure man, will love to work with like minded people ", "@Rudra775 I am a newbie in Open Source.. but i know about the task..can you help me contribute to this project as well\n\nIt will be a great help for me", "@PrithvijitBose im not an expert either, just trying to learn from everywhere i can. lets connect on discord and discuss. `rudraaa_24`", "Hey @smokeyScraper \uD83D\uDC4B\n\nI've completed the implementation for the `thinking_node` as discussed in #97.  \nPlease Check The PR\nAll checks have passed ???, and I???ve also addressed CodeRabbit's suggestion regarding the import.\n\nThe node now rephrases informal user queries using Gemini (LLM) and routes them more cleanly to the appropriate tool (FAQ or Web Search).\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to make any changes ??? happy to improve it further! \uD83D\uDE80\n" ],

So if had results and switch out of the app or i receive the lock screen of my phone, the app triggers a re-search of the already found results. This is realy anoying and in my oppinion a bug. \n\nI think a full re-search shoul'd only be applied when i scroll up. I mean scroll down also triggers the search to add the next results of my hashtag search. Because when this re-search is triggered it starts completly from the beginning. so i need to scroll down again until i reach the part of my search which i don't looked into. \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Search a Hashtag\n2. See Results and Scroll Down\n3. Wait for Lock Screen of Phone or Switch shortly to another App (ex. Email)\n4. Switch Back\n\n### Pixelfed version\n\n1.4.0.1\n\n### Platforms\n\nAndroid\n\n### Device model\n\nSamsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G (Android 13)\n\n### Other information\n\n_No response_\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nYes",

Here???s my high-level plan:\n\n1. **Interface scaffolding**  \n   - Pull the exact `NFTContractInterface`, `JobContractInterface`, etc. from Issues #440 & #441.  \n   - Generate TS stubs for each contract method & event signature.\n\n2. **Mock implementations**  \n   - For each contract interface, create a `MockXyzContract` class that simulates state in-memory (e.g. `Map<???>`).  \n   - Implement all methods with realistic return types, incrementing IDs or toggling states as needed.  \n   - Include optional IPFS-style metadata where applicable.\n\n3. **Configurable delays & errors**  \n   - Add a shared `MockConfig` where teams can set per-contract or per-method delays (in ms) and error rates.  \n   - Wrap methods in a helper that injects `await sleep(config.delay)` and randomly throws when `config.errorRate > 0`.\n\n4. **Dockerized local server**  \n   - Spin up an Express (or Fastify) HTTP+JSON-RPC server exposing each mock contract under distinct endpoints (e.g. `/mock/nft/mint`).  \n   - Write a `Dockerfile` that installs dependencies, builds TS, and starts the mock server.  \n   - Expose ports & volume-mount docs for easy local use.\n\n5. **Documentation & examples**  \n   - Add a `README.md` with:\n     - Installation via `docker build` + `docker run`\n     - Environment variables or JSON config format\n     - Sample TS code showing how to `import { MockNFTContract }` or call the Docker-based RPC.  \n   - Provide a small `example/` folder with a Next.js or Node script that mints a token, polls for events, and demonstrates error injection.\n\n6. **Testing**  \n   - Write unit tests (Jest) to assert that each mock follows its interface and respects delays/errors.  \n   - Add a CI step in `mock/` that runs these tests.\n\nI???ll follow the project???s CONTRIBUTING guidelines, commit under a branch named `mock-contracts-setup`, and open a draft PR once I???ve scaffolded the first two mocks. Please assign this issue to me or let me know if there???s any other setup I should follow first.

I think the best bang for buck is asking plugin devs to add annual tags to their repos. Any beets plugin should be tagged with `beets-plugin` (or whatever name we decide) and the current year - `2025`. Github search allows boolean operators so we could just link to plugins as they update.\n\nhttps://github.com/search?q=+%222025%22+AND+%22beets-plugin%22&type=repositories\n\nCurrent state is just an alphabetical sort:\n\nhttps://beets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins/aura.html\n\nWe could sort by stars by default. Unfortunately, alphabetical sort in github searches isn't possible.\n\nhttps://github.com/search?q=%22beets-plugin%22&type=repositories&s=stars&o=desc\n\nIf a developer stops updating a git repo for a year, that's a sign that the plugin is no longer supported.

Maintenance overhead: one tag per year per repo, and 2 lines of markdown in the docs per year.\n\nHere's how it could look in our docs:\n\n---\n\n# Last Updated: 2026\n\n[Click here](https://github.com/search?q=+%222026%22+AND+%22beets-plugin%22&type=repositories)\n\n# Last Updated: 2025\n\n[Click here](https://github.com/search?q=+%222025%22+AND+%22beets-plugin%22&type=repositories)\n\n# Last Updated: 2024 and earlier\n\nYou can consult our [legacy list of plugins](https://beets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins/aura.html) that have not been updated recently.

Is there anything Zen Browser does to the Firefox options that I have changed manually that could effect it?\n\nI manually change 'browser.enable_automatic_image_resizing' and 'browser.enable_click_image_resizing' in about:config within Firefox every time I have installed it. It is the only things I change in about:config. Maybe I haven't done this on my Linux yet; I have just started using it.\n\nDoes Zen Browser have options for theses toggles within the settings? Or does it come with these already modified?", "Zen has those in about:config. Both of them are true on Zen. I don't tweak any settings directly in about:config though, so I assume that's the default on Zen. I also still have a Firefox install and both of them are true as well. \n\nEdit: I just tried a fresh add-on install on Firefox. Without changing anything, the videos are not stretched. I changed \"Thumbnails per Row\" (General > Thumbnails) to 6, and videos are still not stretched. But importing the same settings from Zen to Firefox produced the bugs. Resetting the settings, the bug isn't produced. ", "Alright. So it must be a setting in our 'Improve YouTube!' addons. Something we changed a while back and is now causing the problem.\n\nI had an old settings backup from 12th October 2024 which I ported over to the Linux installed Firefox. I think it was before the issues with thumbnails. I have exported the Windows settings and had a look at the differences between them.\n\nHere is a list of the differences. The problem must surely be here:\n\n### **These below are new in the .json file. Changes I have made in the Windows version since the last backup, which are not in the Linux version**\n\n\"header_hide_logo\":false,\n\"header_position\":\"normal\",\n\"hide_clip_button\":\"hidden\",\n\"hide_save_button\":\"normal\",\n\"player_autoplay_button\":false,\n\"player_cinema_mode_button\":false,\n\"player_forced_volume\":false,\n\"player_loudness_normalization\":true,\n\"player_popup_button\":false,\n\"player_repeat_button\":false,\n\"player_volume\":9,\n\"remove_member_only\":true,\n\"title_version\":true,\n\n### **These below are the differences in settings that exist in both .json files**\n\n\"hide_share_button\":\"icons_only\", changed to \"hide_share_button\":\"hidden\",\n\"lastDarkTheme\":\"night\", changed to \"lastDarkTheme\":\"sunset\",\n\"lastLightTheme\":\"custom\", changed to \"lastLightTheme\":\"desert\",\n\"player_color\":\"amber\", changed to \"player_color\":\"default\",\n\"theme\":\"night\", changed to \"theme\":\"sunset\",\n\nThis is a good place to start I think.\n\nI also reloaded the old settings to the windows version and all seems to be fine with those settings, too. Which I was hoping would not be the case. Some interaction between settings and browser and OS makes it more complicated to diagnose.", "Ok so I fixed the Linux YouTube Playlists last night.\n\n- First, I backed up my settings from Windows Improve YouTube\n- Went to my broken Linux version\n- Opened Improve YouTube settings and clicked _backup&reset_ > _reset all settings_ \n- Opened a new tab and went to a playlist; it was fixed\n- Then I imported the settings I backed up earlier\n- Opened a new tab and checked the playlist and it still worked fine\n\nIt still worked today after booting up so looks like this fixed it for me.\n\nIf you backup your settings, reset them, then re-import them, checking playlists between each step; it may fix it for you, too.\n\nIf not, try switching to the settings in the last post above, that have changed between both .json files and repeat the steps.\n\nHopefully someone can piece together why first resetting and then re-importing my newer .json file fixed this weirdness.\nIf just saving, resetting, re-importing fixes others' playlists, we can rule out the change in settings between backups at least.", "I'm experiencing this issue as of today, with thumbnails stretched as wide as the layout allows in both playlists and channel pages. This issue started happening right after I accidentally changed the \"Thumbnails per row\" setting (for which there's no reset button turn back the default behavior). Any value I set to it doesn't affect this issue.\n\nTried backing up my settings, clearing all settings in the extension using the \"Reset all settings\" button inside the extension's backup settings, and modifying my settings.json file to remove the thumbnails setting before loading it back to the extension. However, while the number of thumbnails per row returned to the normal value used by youtube, the stretched thumbnails still appear, even though I removed the setting that caused this issue.\n\nMight try later to fully reinstall the extension and see if that works. \n\nBrowser: Firefox 140 on Linux.\n\nUpdate: Clearing extension settings while on a channel page instantly fixes the problem, but as soon as I import my settings again, the issue reappears. Reinstalling didn't work either, since it pulled my synchronized settings.\n\nUpdate 2: Ended up just resetting extension settings and restoring my configuration manually. Tried checking the json for any extraneous settings that might have been changed, but nothing stood out as the source for the issue. Clearing cookies didn't help either, just in case.", "Same here, reset settings and restoring my configuration manually and the bug isn't reproduced.

No synchronisation, manual backup, reset settings, check a playlist, re-import settings, restart browser, check playlist. No messing with settings or .json file in between any steps.\nThat's what seems to work for me.\n\nI have 'four thumbnails per row' on Windows and 'five' on Linux. They are both fine.

Fresh install of improved youtube (IY), everything is fine. Imported my .json file I shared in this issue post, bugged playlist and home channel. reset settings, everything fine again. manually set via GUI, not by json file, like the bugged set up from my first device. everything is fine, playlist and channel home not bugged. \n\nNow in my first device, the W10 PC, I reset settings, import the new settings on the W11 laptop. issue is fixed. playlist and channel home not bugged. changed the number per row to 8 just for extreme. still not bugged. \n\nno messing with json file because I don't really know json, and also don't really want to try it lol. ", "@91grayjay  Ok, cool. So it seems like something was changed in an Improve YouTube update that our old settings didn't like. Maybe the way to fix it for everyone, is to have the Add-on (somehow) backup all settings, reset them and then re-apply them.\n\nI'm not sure how because it needs to ask for an extra permission to backup the settings. Possibly export to memory first instead?\nI wonder how many people this has effected that dropped the Add-on because it is the easy fix?", "I was mainly experiencing this on YT homepages. One of the last settings I changed was the **Thumbnail Size**. This setting, when changed, breaks the layout in some cases.\n\nThis can be validated by resetting all settings and only updating that as I do below.\n\n<img width=\"800\" height=\"500\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f5abc82-ecf4-4517-823b-40f2cdea0625\" />\n\n<img width=\"800\" height=\"500\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/278eb715-0ba1-4a24-94ec-6d3ef12c30f6\" />\n\nIt remains broken no matter which option you pick. A way to fix it without manually setting up the extension again:\n\n- Export a backup of existing files\n- Open the JSON\n- Find the **thumbnail_size** setting and remove it and its value\n- Reset existing settings on Improve YouTube, do not skip this\n- Import your settings again\n- And most importantly, don't change the Thumbnail Size setting again\n\nHopefully this can help save some time for others that stumble across it \uD83D\uDE42 " ],

Maybe we can write our own debouncer that handles that rather than use the notify mini debouncer?", "If you mean \"report only once per interval\": debouncer-mini does that by default (otherwise it's a bug). There is also debouncer-full if you need more features.", "Can we get a list of all the debounced events in the interval?

Hope that helps.\r\n\r\nNot sure if some \"cooldown\" window could be added / helps more.", "I played with this a bit, and the implementation gets messy if we try and be smart about handling a batch of events minimally. We're lucky if the batch of events requires a full site rebuild, because then we can let the rebuild cover all other events. If we have multiple events and none require a site rebuild, we have to add logic to make sure that the union of all changes required is applied correctly, and its this logic that gets messy due to a variety of checks and sensitive ordering (ex: check for full rebuild cases, then partial update cases, etc.).\r\n\r\nI have a local implementation based on `notify-debouncer-full`. I have not read the code of `notify-debouncer-mini`, but if it is sensitive to the same events that `-full` is, including [opening and closing files](https://docs.rs/notify/6.1.1/notify/event/enum.AccessKind.html), we probably don't want `-mini` because we can't get at the event type and therefore filter those events out.\r\n\r\nI played with behavior on master by using this toy script and a personal project:\r\n\r\n```\r\necho \" \" >> config.toml\r\necho \" \" >> config.toml\r\necho \" \" >> content/blog/2024-05-14.md\r\necho \" \" >> content/blog/2024-05-14.md\r\ntouch templates/foo.html templates/bar.html\r\ntouch sass/foo.scss\r\ntouch sass/bar.scss\r\ntouch sass/baz.scss\r\n```\r\n\r\nMaster shows (truncated in places):\r\n\r\n```\r\nChange detected @ 2024-05-17 20:52:35\r\n-> Config changed. The browser needs to be refreshed to make the changes visible.\r\n\r\nChange detected @ 2024-05-17 20:52:36\r\n-> Content changed /foo/site/content/blog/2024-05-14.md\r\n\r\nChange detected @ 2024-05-17 20:52:36\r\n-> Template changed /foo/site/templates/foo.html\r\n\r\nChange detected @ 2024-05-17 20:52:36\r\n-> Template changed /foo/site/templates/bar.html\r\n\r\nChange detected @ 2024-05-17 20:52:36\r\n-> Sass file changed /foo/site/sass/foo.scss\r\n\r\nChange detected @ 2024-05-17 20:52:36\r\n-> Sass file changed /foo/site/sass/bar.scss\r\n\r\nChange detected @ 2024-05-17 20:52:36\r\n-> Sass file changed /foo/site/sass/baz.scss\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn my local usage of `notify-debouncer-full`, the same script causes the same 7 events to be raised, but they are joined in a single batch.\r\n\r\nAre you okay with me just iterating through the events in the batch and applying updates in series for now? That way we can reuse a lot of the existing handling logic in `serve`, and the diff becomes a bit less messy.

      "comments" : [ "I second this. This would be great.", "After looking into this more, I am not sure what the best method to accomplish this would be.\n\nMy initial thought was to do something like adding a property called `AdormentTooltip` that you could set for example \n```cshtml\n<MudTextField @ref=\"multilineReference\" T=\"string\" Label=\"Multiline Select\" Lines=\"3\" Variant=\"Variant.Outlined\" Text=\"@sampleText\" Adornment=\"Adornment.End\" AdornmentIcon=\"@Icons.Material.Filled.Api\" OnAdornmentClick=\"@(() => multilineReference.SelectAsync())\" AdornmentTooltip=\"Select All Text\" />\n```\n\nHowever, I don't like this method because it doesn't allow users to fully customize the Tooltip as you are unable to provide additional Tooltip settings. So, I decided to do something like:\n\n```cshtml\n<MudTextField @ref=\"multilineReference\" T=\"string\" Label=\"Multiline Select\" Lines=\"3\" Variant=\"Variant.Outlined\" Text=\"@sampleText\" Adornment=\"Adornment.End\" AdornmentIcon=\"@Icons.Material.Filled.Api\" OnAdornmentClick=\"@(() => multilineReference.SelectAsync())\" AdornmentTooltip=\"Select All Text\" AdornmentTooltipOptions=\"@TooltipOptions\" />\n\n@code {\n  private Dictionary<string, dynamic> TooltipOptions => new Dictionary<string, dynamic> {\n    { \"Duration\", 500.00 },\n    { \"Arrow\", true },\n    { \"Placement\", Placement.Right },\n    { \"Color\", Color.Secondary },\n    { \"RootStyle\", \"width: 100%;\" },\n    { \"Style\", \"font-size: 1rem; padding: 0.5rem 1.25rem;\" },\n  };\n}\n```\nWhich this appears to work, but this feels dirty too.\n\nSo lastly, I tried to do something like this:\n```cshtml\n<MudTextField @ref=\"multilineReference\" T=\"string\" Label=\"Multiline Select\" Lines=\"3\" Variant=\"Variant.Outlined\" Text=\"@sampleText\" Adornment=\"Adornment.End\" AdornmentIcon=\"@Icons.Material.Filled.Api\" OnAdornmentClick=\"@(() => multilineReference.SelectAsync())\" />\n  <AdornmentContent>\n    <MudTooltip Text=\"Select All Text\" Duration=\"500.00\" Color=\"Color.Secondary\">\n      <MudButtonIcon Icon=\"@Icons.Material.Filled.Api\" OnClick=\"@(() => multilineReference.SelectAsync())\" />\n    </MudTooltip>\n  </AdornmentContent>\n</MudTextField>\n```\nBut this felt very over engineering. I would really like feedback on which is the best method to implement this before continuing my work on this PR. Also, if anyone has any other suggestions, please let me know.", "this is easily the best method and follows the pattern of many controls. Nullable so if it doesn't exist you just do what has always been done. You will, however need to add this to MudField too, and lots of documentation. so if you use AdornmentContent all other Adornment features would be ignored except Adornment.End/Start. I like it.\n\n```\n<MudTextField @ref=\"multilineReference\" T=\"string\" Label=\"Multiline Select\" Lines=\"3\" Variant=\"Variant.Outlined\" Text=\"@sampleText\" Adornment=\"Adornment.End\" AdornmentIcon=\"@Icons.Material.Filled.Api\" OnAdornmentClick=\"@(() => multilineReference.SelectAsync())\" />\n  <AdornmentContent>\n    <MudTooltip Text=\"Select All Text\" Duration=\"500.00\" Color=\"Color.Secondary\">\n      <MudButtonIcon Icon=\"@Icons.Material.Filled.Api\" OnClick=\"@(() => multilineReference.SelectAsync())\" />\n    </MudTooltip>\n  </AdornmentContent>\n</MudTextField>\n```", "Agree with @versile2 . Having a RenderFragment parameter that overrides all the other Adornment parameters makes sense. It is also mostly backwards compatible since it is only applied if it is non-null.", "I feel the same way, I just wanted to ask for feedback before I spend time implementing it only to realize it's not the preferred method I should have gone down.", "Hi! Any updates on this feature? I was just now looking for the option \uD83D\uDE04 ", "This could be implemented without a breaking change. Just need two things, @danielchalmers or @ScarletKuro approval and someone willing to do the work. I'm not opposed but I'm backed up at least two weeks.", "Yes, icon buttons should be able to define both an ARIA label and a tooltip.\n\nAn elegant solution for the user, without [reworking adornment markup](https://github.com/MudBlazor/MudBlazor/issues/8945), could be to automatically add the MudTooltip behind the scenes:\n\n```razor\n@if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(AdornmentTooltip))\n{\n    <MudTooltip Text=\"@AdornmentTooltip\">\n        <MudInputAdornment Class=\"@AdornmentClassname\"\n                        Icon=\"@AdornmentIcon\"\n                        Color=\"@AdornmentColor\"\n                        Size=\"@IconSize\"\n                        Text=\"@AdornmentText\"\n                        Placement=\"@Adornment.Start\"\n                        AdornmentClick=\"@OnAdornmentClick\" />\n    </MudTooltip>\n}\nelse\n{\n    <MudInputAdornment Class=\"@AdornmentClassname\"\n                    Icon=\"@AdornmentIcon\"\n                    Color=\"@AdornmentColor\"\n                    Size=\"@IconSize\"\n                    Text=\"@AdornmentText\"\n                    Placement=\"@Adornment.Start\"\n                    AdornmentClick=\"@OnAdornmentClick\" />\n}\n```\n\nNot as elegant on the backend but would provide the least friction before/if adornments are reworked." ],

Do not commit changes that are unrelated to your task\n4. Check after you created PR, if you committed everything\n\n\n## Task Description\n1. In the [admin endpoints](./blob/main/margin/margin_app/app/api/admin.py), add an endpoint called `/assets`. Call the [`Assets statistic` method from this issue](https://github.com/djeck1432/spotnet/issues/906) to retrieve the data. Format the response using pydantic BaseModel.\n2. Add integration tests for it.\n3. Ensure that all tests(workflows) and endpoint works properly.",

I'm experiencing the same issue, I want to configure hybrid_search with weighted_score when I create some document, but it's not working. I tried passing my retrieval_model object like:\n\n`retrieval_model: {\n      search_method: 'hybrid_search',\n      reranking_enable: true,\n      reranking_mode: 'weighted_score',\n      vector_setting: {\n        vector_weight: 0.7,\n        embedding_provider_name: 'openai',\n        embedding_model_name: 'text-embedding-3-large',\n      },\n      keyword_setting: {\n        keyword_weight: 0.3,\n      },\n      top_k: 5,\n      score_threshold_enabled: false,\n      score_threshold: 0,\n    },`\n\nWhat is the correct way to pass these data to API? The path route is '/v1/datasets/${datasetId}/document/create-by-file'", "@dosu\nis it possible to configure the hybrid search with weighted_score using the dify API?", "<!-- Answer -->\nYes, it is possible to configure the hybrid search with `weighted_score` using the Dify API. The correct way to pass the data to the API is by structuring the `weights` parameter as a dictionary within the `retrieval_model` object. Here's an example of how you should format your payload:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"retrieval_model\": {\n    \"search_method\": \"hybrid_search\",\n    \"reranking_enable\": true,\n    \"reranking_mode\": \"weighted_score\",\n    \"weights\": {\n      \"vector_setting\": {\n        \"vector_weight\": 0.7,\n        \"embedding_provider_name\": \"openai\",\n        \"embedding_model_name\": \"text-embedding-3-large\"\n      },\n      \"keyword_setting\": {\n        \"keyword_weight\": 0.3\n      }\n    },\n    \"top_k\": 5,\n    \"score_threshold_enabled\": false,\n    \"score_threshold\": 0\n  }\n}\n```\n\nEnsure that the `weights` parameter is correctly structured as shown above. This setup allows you to assign custom weights to semantic and keyword searches, enabling a balance between full-text search and vector search <sup>[[1]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/12546)</sup>.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To continue talking to [Dosu](https://dosu.dev), mention @dosu.*\n\n---\n<sup>Help Dosu learn!
