A few key changes to note:\n\n* **KRaft mode:** As of Strimzi??0.46, ZooKeeper support has been removed. Kafka must now run in KRaft mode.\n* **MirrorMaker??1:** Deprecated and no longer supported.\n* **CR updates:** Ensure any test custom resources reflect the new API versions.\n\nLooking further ahead, environments running Kubernetes **v1.27+** will require **Strimzi??0.48.x** or newer.\n\nCurrently, our E2E tests reference Strimzi??0.35.0 in `keda/tests/helper/helper.go:66`:\n\n```go\nStrimziVersion = \"0.35.0\"\n```\n\nThis may break on modern clusters (e.g., in `TestSetUpStrimzi`).\n\n**Proposal:**\n\n* Bump to **0.47.0** as our baseline in tests.\n* Plan for **0.48.x** once we start validating in Kubernetes??v1.27 environments.\n\n**References:**\n\n* [[Strimzi??0.47.0 Release Notes](https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/releases)](https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/releases)\n* [[KRaft migration changes](https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/releases#:~:text=,KRaft%20migration%20has%20been%20removed)](https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/releases#:~:text=,KRaft%20migration%20has%20been%20removed)\n* [[ZooKeeper deprecation](https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/releases#:~:text=%2A%20Support%20for%20ZooKeeper,46%20or%20newer)](https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/releases#:~:text=%2A%20Support%20for%20ZooKeeper,46%20or%20newer)\n\n", "I would go for `0.47.0`, because that is the latest stable release.", "@rickbrouwer  I agree ??? I???d also go with 0.47.0 since it???s the latest stable release and fully compatible with Kubernetes 1.25+. It includes important updates like KRaft mode support and deprecates older components such as MirrorMaker 1.\n\nLet???s proceed with updating to this version in the tests." ],

Consistent and responsive margins and padding.\n??? Proper alignment of form elements (inputs, labels, buttons).\n??? Enhanced visual hierarchy (use of font sizes, spacing, and layout).\n??? Improve mobile responsiveness using flexbox/grid and media queries.\n??? Add subtle hover and focus effects for better interactivity.\n\n\uD83D\uDCA1 Suggestions:\nUse a container with fixed max-width and auto margin for centering.\nApply consistent vertical spacing using rem or em units.\nTest across screen sizes to ensure layout doesn't break on small devices.\nConsider using a UI library (e.g., Tailwind, Bootstrap) for faster consistency.\n\n\uD83D\uDCF8 Screenshots :\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"1015\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e44d479-8c3a-4e9c-9512-26f2f8f8688c\" />\n\n<img width=\"818\" height=\"671\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65dd287c-0464-4826-9828-0a1f4ecd0822\" />\n",

The following pages should help you to get started:\n- https://github.com/eclipse-ide/\n- https://github.com/eclipse-pde/eclipse.pde?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-contribute\n\nand if you have further questions, don't hesitate to ask, we are here to help.", "Hey guys, I'm working on this issue in a group with ahenden13. We were wondering if anybody has thoughts on how we should format the display, as there is a lot of unhelpful information. \n\nWe are inclined to just remove these useless bits, but we could also just remove the error bits, leave everything and bold the set bits, etc. If anyone has any input it would be appreciated!", "I think the main issue is that you can not know programmatically what styles a widget support at the moment.\n\nSo the first thing would be to have some declarative way (e.g. an annotation) to carry that information and update all widgets to use that thing before one can make progress here. Hardcoding the supported styles seem not very useful to me.", "That makes a lot of sense. @neilcabanilla and I found the method getStyle() in [SpyView.java](https://github.com/eclipse-pde/eclipse.pde/blob/master/ui/org.eclipse.swt.tools.spies/src/org/eclipse/swt/tools/views/SpyView.java) which we could borrow to easily grab only the relevant style bits for a given widget and then bold the styles that are currently being used. The downside to this function is that it uses a lot of long if...else statements to manually grab the set style bits one by one, with hardcoded styles. We have a solution ready to go using this method, and we could do a PR right now.\n\nWhat you are advising is we instead use something like an annotation. We could try to build this and do a PR for SWT, or we could try to build a similar solution within Eclipse PDE. For example, we could use a format like a registry of SWT styles, which might look something like:\n\npublic class Registry {\n    private hashmap;\n\n    static {\n        hashmap.put(Button.class, Set.of(\n            SWT.PUSH,\n            SWT.CHECK,\n            SWT.RADIO,\n            SWT.TOGGLE\n        ));\n\n        //etc\n    }\n\n    public static Set<Integer> getStyles(Class) {\n        // return styles for a given class\n    }\n}\n\nThis is probably less optimal than adding something to the widget class directly, but it is a lot more human-readable than the getStyle() idea and allows us to update everything a lot easier down the line. \n\nWhat should our next steps be? Should we do a PR with what we have now, build a new solution in the format I described here, try to create a solution by modifying the widget class itself, or do something else?", "> What you are advising is we instead use something like an annotation.\n\nI do not advise to use _something like an annotation_ but to use an annotation. e.g it could be a repeatable `@Style` with and int value and an optional String description. If we choose retention of runtime that information could be easily queried by tools (even e.g. in autocompletion or validation) to learn about valid styles what currently is only documented in the javadoc (and sadly even only in the class description and not at the constructor).\n\n> The downside to this function is that it uses a lot of long if...else statements to manually grab the set style bits one by one, with hardcoded styles.\n\nThe most limiting factor is that there is literally no way for it to be used with custom widgets outside of what we know at platform / SWT.", "Hello @laeubi,\n\nI am in team with @WillPeltz  & @ahenden13. We were exploring information regarding Annotations you've previously mentioned. Based on our understanding here is what we came up with\n\n```\nimport java.lang.annotation.Retention;\nimport java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy;\nimport java.lang.annotation.Repeatable;\n\n@Repeatable(Styles.class)\n@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)\npublic @interface Style {\n    int value();                //Store style value i.e. SWT.BORDER\n    String description() default \"\";  //  A description = Creates a Border\n}\n\n\n//Container to support repeatability (For multiple styles in a widget)\nimport java.lang.annotation.Retention;\nimport java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy;\n\n@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)\npublic @interface Styles {\n    Style[] value();\n}\n```\nWe could put this interface in the SWT repositories or make a wrapper class in PDE.\n\nDoes this align with the approach you have in your mind? \n\nThank you so much!\n", "Hello @laeubi, @akurtakov, @HannesWell, @iloveeclipse, @vogella\n\nJust following up on the approach we shared above; we???d love your input to keep us aligned with your vision of the ideal issue solution. \n\nDoes this way of defining our style annotations make sense, and should we attach these annotations in the SWT repository or just create wrapper classes in Eclipse PDE?\n\nThank you for your time and guidance!" ],

I think the `list-numberN` thing might be a red herring. Instead, I believe it's the conditions that lead to setting `list-start-numberN` which are the real crux (see [this code](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/blob/475456ec10705e7771dd488796a74acb5834411a/src/static/js/domline.ts#L109)).\n\nI see that CSS is responsible for the actual sequential numbering, and it appears that this depends on having a `list-start-numberN` class on some numbered list element. This requires `listType == \"number\" && start == 1`. But if the first list element isn't of type number, we don't set `list-start-number1` on it, and so the CSS can't do its job.

Write a brief description of how you will approach the task (without using ChatGPT).\n3. Add your Telegram handler in your application (e.g., in OnlyDust or similar)\n4. Write ETA in your application\n\n\n## What should I do if I have a problem\n1. Try to google it before asking. Googling is taking major part of dev work \n2. If you couldn't find answer your question with Google, text your question to [dev](https://t.me/spotnet_dev/4) group with your question.\n3. Do not send DM to maintainer, it would be better and faster to ask other contributors in chat \n\n\n## How to prepare PR\n1. Check if your code [smell](https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/smells) good\n2. Add `close #<issue number>` to link your issue with your PR\n3. Do not commit changes that are unrelated to your task\n4. Check after you created PR, if you committed everything\n\n\n## Task Description\n1. Set up backend part using this [README.md](https://github.com/djeck1432/spotnet/tree/main/margin/margin_app/README.md)\n2. Don't forget to run [seed data generator](https://github.com/djeck1432/spotnet/blob/main/margin/margin_app/README.md#5-seed-data-generator) to populate DB\n3. `/sign-up` route is an old endpoint, which will be used later for finishing email registration; for now do not change it\n4. Create `/signup` route that will have styling like `/login` page, and those two pages should be accessible from each other in case if user already has an account or wants to create new account\n5. In the beginning, there should be only `email` input field with signup button; don't forget about email validation\n6. When clicking on signup button, API request to `http://0.0.0.0:8000/api/auth/signup` backend endpoint should be sent, and based on response, success screen or error message will be shown\n7. Success screen should contain information that email was sent, and user has to check his email to finish registration\n\n_NOTE: For now, you will be always getting errors from backend because you don't have env variables, and it's okay, but you still have to implement both scenarios (success and error)_\n",

Locate the navigation/menu bar.\n3. Click on the Editor link.\n\n## Expected Behavior\nClicking the Editor link should redirect the user to a live code editor interface, where:\n1. Users can write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\n2. There are three side-by-side editors, each labelled.\n3. A Run button executes the code and displays it in an output pane.\n4.

      "url" : "https://github.com/google/site-kit-wp/issues/10988",
      "repositoryName" : "google/site-kit-wp",
      "description" : "## Feature Description\n\nStarting in #10165 it was proposed to refactor several methods that hook into the `googlesitekit_inline_modules_data` filter, so they are consolidated into a single method `get_inline_data` that will return all data in the single method.\n\nFor consistency, we should do this in all modules, and preferably enforce this as with an interface. We can create `Module_With_Inline_data` interface that will force adding `get_inline_data` method, and new trait `Module_With_Inline_Data_Trait` that will include `register_inline_data` method, which will hook into the `googlesitekit_inline_modules_data` filter and invoke `get_inline_data` method.\n\nWe can then refactor all modules to use this new interface and trait, and it should be used in all new modules that are created in the future.\n\n---------------\n\n_Do not alter or remove anything below. The following sections will be managed by moderators only._\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n\n* New interface `Module_With_Inline_Data` is introduced to enforce the presence of a unified method on any module that provides inline data.\n* New trait `Module_With_Inline_Data_Trait` is introduced to include a registration method - which will hook into the `googlesitekit_inline_modules_data` and use the interface enforced method as a callback\n* Existing modules with inline data should be refactored to use the interface and trait for consistency.\n\n## Implementation Brief\n\n* [x] Add new interface `includes/Core/Modules/Module_With_Inline_Data.php` \n  *  It should enforce `get_inline_data` method which should return an array\n* [x] Add new trait `includes/Core/Modules/Module_With_Inline_Data_Trait.php`\n  * Include  `register_inline_data` method which hooks into the `googlesitekit_inline_modules_data` and uses `get_inline_data` as a callback\n* [x] Update following modules: \n  * `includes/Modules/Analytics_4.php`\n  * `includes/Modules/Ads.php`\n  * `includes/Modules/Sign_In_With_Google.php`\n    * Each should implement `Module_With_Inline_Data` interface and use `Module_With_Inline_Data_Trait` trait\n    * Refactor existing callback for `googlesitekit_inline_modules_data` hook to use new method `get_inline_data`\n    * In the `register` method, invoke `register_inline_data`\n* Search through codebase if any new module was added in the meantime which is also using the inline data, after this IB was written\n\n### Test Coverage\n\n* Update tests for updated modules to adapt the new method name usage\n\n## QA Brief (QA:ENG)\n\n* Set up Site Kit with Analytics and Ads enabled.\n* Go to the Site Kit page.\n* Type `_googlesitekitModulesData` in the console.\n  * The object should have an `ads` key, whose value is an object containing:\n    * `supportedConversionEvents`: an array of supported conversion events.\n      * As a sanity check, install WooCommerce. This array should contain WooCommerce-related events (`add-to-cart`, `purchase`).\n  * The object should have an `analytics-4` key, whose value is an object containing:\n    * `customDimensionsDataAvailable`\n    * `resourceAvailabilityDates`\n    * `tagIDMismatch`\n    * `newEvents`\n    * `lostEvents`\n    * `newBadgeEvents`\n  * Without setting up Sign In With Google, the object should not have `sign-in-with-google`.\n  * After setting up Sign In With Google, the object should have the `sign-in-with-google` key, whose value is an object containing:\n    * `isWooCommerceActive`\n    * `isWooCommerceRegistrationEnabled`\n\n\n\n\n## Changelog entry\n\n* N/A.\n",

", "Hey @abdelmalekkkkk, congrats on raising your first PR!\n\nIt does need a QA Brief, which will be needed for QA but is also useful for CR (and, indeed, needs to be reviewed as part of the CR process). I've assigned it back to you in Execution to add the QAB.", "@techanvil Done! Thanks for letting me know.", "Thanks @abdelmalekkkkk. The PR for the issue is good and I've gone ahead and merged it - congrats on your first merge!\n\nThat said - the current QAB is a bit too broad in scope; there's a lot of functionality associated with the Ads, Analytics and Sign in with Google modules, and QA engineers could spend time smoke testing unnecessary areas (or, more likely would ask you to advise them what they should be focusing on).\n\nTo make the QAB more specific, we should focus on the specific areas of functionality that the refactored code relates to, i.e. the functionality that depends on the pieces of inline data being present.\n\nTo identify these areas, I'd suggest searching for GitHub issues which mention the data keys, e.g. searching for [`supportedConversionEvents`](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Agoogle%2Fsite-kit-wp+supportedConversionEvents&type=issues), and use these issues and their QABs for smoke testing suggestions. Alternatively, use IDE tooling to help identify PRs and their linked issues (for example I use GitLens in Cursor/VS Code, although this [doesn't seem available](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZedEditor/comments/1b5q3dl/switched_to_zed_and_missing_gitlens/) for Zed).\n\nSimply linking to these issues with the direction to run through their QABs should suffice, rather than reproducing the QABs in this issue.\n\nThis is admittedly a bit fiddly as, despite the refactor itself being pretty straightforward, giving it a proper test means delving into some complex areas of functionality. Please feel free to reach out to me if you need any help with this.", "Thanks for the input @techanvil \n\nI figured it would be way more efficient to make this a QA ENG and just have the engineer make sure the inline module data is populated correctly with a simple console check, instead of having a QA try out all the different places that those pieces of inline data are used. I updated the QA brief accordingly.  Please let me know your thoughts.", "Thanks @abdelmalekkkkk. Great work digging in on this one.\n\nMaking this a `QA:Eng` brief sounds sensible. The QAB you've drafted looks good, it just needs a bit of reformatting. We don't tend to use checkboxes for the QABs, I'd suggest sticking to bullet points, and some of the keys need to be wrapped in backticks. There are also a couple of minor grammatical points to address - as a shortcut, you can ask [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) to review the content, for example you could use this prompt:\n\n```\nReview the following for grammar:\n\n* [ ] Setup Site Kit with Analytics and Ads enabled\n* [ ] Go to the Site Kit page\n* [ ] Type?? `_googlesitekitModulesData` in the console\n\t* [ ] The object should have a `ads` key whose value is an object containing\n\t\t* [ ] supportedConversionEvents: array of supported conversion events\n\t\t\t* [ ] As a sanity check, install WooCommerce. This array should contain WooCommerce related events (`add-to-cart`, `purchase`)\n\t* [ ] The object should have `analytics-4` key whose value is an object containing\n\t\t* [ ] customDimensionsDataAvailable\n\t\t* [ ] resourceAvailabilityDates\n\t\t* [ ] tagIDMismatch\n\t\t* [ ] newEvents\n\t\t* [ ] lostEvents\n\t\t* [ ] newBadgeEvents\n\t* [ ] Without setting up Sign In With Google, the object should not have `sign-in-with-google`\n\t* [ ] With Sign In With Google setup, the object should have the `sign-in-with-google` and its value should be an object containing\n\t\t* [ ] isWooCommerceActive\n\t\t* [ ] isWooCommerceRegistrationEnabled\n```\n\nOnce it's tidied up, this should be good to go!", "@techanvil Done!", "Thanks @abdelmalekkkkk, that's great.

Bookmark Notes\nAdd a ??? icon or \"Save\" button beside each note link.\n\nDisplay all saved notes in a \"Bookmarked Notes\" section.\n\nAdd a remove option for flexibility.\n\n??? Personal 5-Star Rating\nAdd 5 clickable stars beside each note.\n\nWhen a user clicks a star (e.g., 4/5), store that rating in localStorage.\n\nOn page load, display the saved rating next to each note.\n\nUse simple tooltips like:\n\n??????????????? ???

Check that no other contributor is working on this issue. If someone is assigned to the issue or claimed to be working on it, ping the person. After one week without a response, the assignee may be changed.\n1. Leave a comment indicating that you are working on the issue, or just create a [pull request](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pulls) after following the steps below. [Mention](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) this issue in the description of the pull request.\n1. Fix the issue locally.\n1. [Run the test suite](https://llvm.org/docs/TestingGuide.html#unit-and-regression-tests) locally. Remember that the subdirectories under `test/` create fine-grained testing targets, so you can e.g. use `make check-clang-ast` to only run Clang's AST tests.\n1. Create a Git commit.\n1. Run [`git clang-format HEAD~1`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html#git-integration) to format your changes.\n1. Open a [pull request](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pulls) to the [upstream repository](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project) on GitHub.

So to get correct known bits, we need to call ARM_AM::decodeVMOVModImm with the proper element size. Just using getConstantOperandAPInt gives the wrong result in many cases.\n\nIf you???d like to verify or experiment with this, the following function is a good way to trigger the pattern:\n```llvm\n; RUN: llc < %s -mtriple armv7-linux-gnueabihf -mattr=+neon | FileCheck %s\ndefine void @test_v2i8(ptr %p) {\n  %a = load <2 x i8>, ptr %p\n  %tmp = call <2 x i8> @llvm.cttz.v2i8(<2 x i8> %a, i1 false)\n  store <2 x i8> %tmp, ptr %p\n  ret void\n}\n``` \nThis will eventually lower into a sequence containing VORRIMM, so it???s useful for testing both codegen and known bits behavior.\n\nHope my suggestions and the draft PR help make the problem clearer and help you understand it clearer!", "Hi @trnguyen34, form draft PR's review, maybe we need add a small test case in `AArch64SelectionDAGTest`.\nWould you be interested in trying that, No pressure at all and I???d be happy to help however I can.", "It shouldn't be in AArch64SelectionDAGTest - you will need to create a ARMSelectionDAGTest equivalent", "I can try to add some test cases this weekend. @woruyu @RKSimon Do you guys have any resource that can help me?", "Take a look through AArch64SelectionDAGTest and see how they did the various computeKnownBits tests in there. \n\nYou will then need to create a minimal llvm\\unittests\\Target\\ARM\\ARMSelectionDAGTest.cpp file (and hook it up to the CMakeLists.txt etc._" ],

This could be helpful for TPC-DS as well.\n\nWe have some hash functions in Velox for Spark now. We could re-use them for Presto C++ to enable this optimization.\n\nwdyt ?", "It seems like this is because we don't know how to translate `$operator$hash_code` into the equivalent in Velox.  But this should be feasible, as obviously Velox is able to hash a bigint.  Isn't this a bug in the plan translator?", "Ah well... This was a deliberate bug in plan translator. \n\nWe generally preferred to use VectorHasher and Velox HashTable and avoid the use of hash_code as much as possible in Velox operators. At the time, the only optimizer rule we found using hash_code was to avoid re-hashing an agg post join, and Velox team was quite insistent that this performance is good out of the box in Velox.\n\nThe prefilter_for_groupby_limit is a very useful optimization and I have found it used in addition to all Velox offers to get good benchmark numbers. So I'm in favor of re-enabling it.\n\nWe just need to expose the right hash functions to map to hash_code (and we have added a bunch of them to Velox now). Re-mapping the functions will be sufficient to enable this optimization.", "This should be straightforward, should we add the `good first issue` label?", "> This should be straightforward, should we add the `good first issue` label?\n\nThat's a good idea. Done.", "This is my feature :) unfortunately it uses a hacky \"timeout\" thing not sure if we want that in native. But I would love to see this working", "> right hash functions to map to hash_code\n\nIIUC, we just recently added xxhash64 (which is used in the join_prefilter optimization). So maybe we can use that?" ],

      "description" : "In roundtrip testing a new concrete `v2::PjParams` struct I realized `SystemTime` includes nanosecond precision. After serializing `SystemTime` into the `EX1` u32 expiration parameter, and deserializing back into the type that precision is lost and an `assert_eq` failed, raising this issue, since we are storing time as `SystemTime` in many parts of the `payjoin` crate.\n\nIt seems to me that encoding this information internally as precise as the URL-serialized representation would be more accurate. For this purpose we may even use [`bitcoin::absolute::Time`](https://docs.rs/bitcoin/latest/bitcoin/absolute/struct.Time.html). Other than accuracy, changing to a u32 UnixTime abstraction gives us the advantage that u32 would work in `wasm` where `SystemTime` is not available.\n\nI think this may be a good first issue to start, but it might be tricky to get the ergonomics right to completely close this issue. We'd need to figure out what type (`u64`, `u32`, or `bitcoin::absolute::Time`?) to expose in the API arguments and across the FFI boundary even if the internal representation becomes `absolute::Time`. We may take a look at how conversion ergonomics from `SystemTime::now()` to `bitcoin::absolute::Time` (or similar functionality) are designed as inspiration.\n\n",

The following sections will be managed by moderators only._\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n\n* Reader Revenue Management module is referencing the `isURLUsingHTTPS` util function from `assets/js/util/is-url-using-https.js` instead of the local one located in the `assets/js/modules/reader-revenue-manager/utils/validation.js`\n* `isURLUsingHTTPS` function is removed from `assets/js/modules/reader-revenue-manager/utils/validation.js` file\n\n## Implementation brief\n\n1. In following files update the import path for `isURLUsingHTTPS`.\n  - assets/js/modules/reader-revenue-manager/index.js\n  - assets/js/modules/reader-revenue-manager/utils/validation.test.js\n\n2. Remove `isURLUsingHTTPS` from `assets/js/modules/reader-revenue-manager/utils/validation.js` file.\n\n### Test coverage\n\nNo additional test change required.\n\n## QA Brief\n\n1. Test on a non https site that we get the warning for RRM module that site should be on https.\n2. Run a quick smoke test around RRM module that everything is functioning normally as before.\n\n## Changelog entry\n\n* N/A.\n",

Create a custom errors for all the controllers\n2. Make all the custom errors a wrapped errors by implementing the `Unwrap()`method \n3. Replace all the regular errors with a new wrappable custom errors\n4. Unwrap the `reconcileErr` error and join the result with `statusErr` and return it \n\nam I right? ", "That's right. The main goal is to be able to return better errors- so we might also want to add new `ConditionReason`s. Wrapping the errors will allow us to then set these based on the outer error type" ],

      "repositoryName" : "cri-o/cri-o",
      "description" : "### What happened?\n\nHi,\n\nI???m using Kubernetes with CRI-O as the container runtime interface and passing USB and other devices to containers using the devices field.\n\nOn the host, the device files have correct permissions (e.g., 0660) with specific owners and groups. However, inside the container (using crun as the OCI runtime), the uid and gid are preserved, but the device permissions are always 0666.\n\nI opened an[ issue in crun](https://github.com/containers/crun/issues/1826), and the response was that the OCI config.json passed to the runtime does not include a fileMode field for the devices, so crun falls back to its default (0666). Here is an example of the generated config:\n\n```\n\"devices\": [\n  {\n    \"path\": \"/dev/bus/usb/002/002\",\n    \"type\": \"c\",\n    \"major\": 189,\n    \"minor\": 129,\n    \"uid\": 107,\n    \"gid\": 107\n  }\n]\n```\n\nAs per the [OCI runtime spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/blob/main/config-linux.md#device), the fileMode field is optional, but when not provided, the runtime will use its own default (often 0666). This behavior causes all containers to have full read/write access to the device regardless of host file permissions.\n\n\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\nFrom what I understand, the CRI implementation (in this case CRI-O) should be responsible for populating the fileMode in the OCI spec if it wants to preserve the host permissions.\n\nCould CRI-O be updated to propagate the device file permissions (mode) into the OCI config? Otherwise, this could lead to unexpected security and access issues inside containers.\n\n### How can we reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)?\n\nOn the host node, set a device file (e.g. /dev/bus/usb/002/002) with specific permissions:\n\n```\nsudo chown 107:107 /dev/bus/usb/002/002\nsudo chmod 0660 /dev/bus/usb/002/002\n```\n\nDeploy a pod that requests the device using the devices field in the PodSpec (via Kubernetes Device Plugin or static configuration if supported).\n\nInside the running container, check the device file permissions:\n\n```\nls -l /dev/bus/usb/002/002\n```\n\n### Anything else we need to know?\n\n_No response_\n\n### CRI-O and Kubernetes version\n\n<details>\n\n```console\n$ crio --version\n[vagrant@node02 ~]$ crio --version\ncrio version 1.33.2\n   GitCommit:      0da1b7c95fa3ec7cb83306a39724bf39e35033f4\n   GitCommitDate:  2025-07-01T08:46:54Z\n   GitTreeState:   dirty\n   BuildDate:      1970-01-01T00:00:00Z\n   GoVersion:      go1.24.2\n   Compiler:       gc\n   Platform:       linux/amd64\n   Linkmode:       static\n   BuildTags:\n     static\n     netgo\n     osusergo\n     exclude_graphdriver_btrfs\n     seccomp\n     apparmor\n     selinux\n   LDFlags:          unknown\n   SeccompEnabled:   true\n   AppArmorEnabled:  false\n[vagrant@node02 ~]$ \n\n```\n\n```console\n$ kubectl version --output=json\nselecting docker as container runtime\nClient Version: v1.33.2\nKustomize Version: v5.6.0\nServer Version: v1.33.2\n```\n\n</details>\n\n\n### OS version\n\n<details>\n\n```console\n# On Linux:\n$ cat /etc/os-release\n# paste output here\n$ uname -a\n# paste output here\n```\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Additional environment details (AWS, VirtualBox, physical, etc.)\n\n<details>\n\n</details>\n",

Here's how you can succeed in this task.\nFirst, some background. Shared libraries are those collections of code that are available to be used throughout the `cht-core`. They are located in `cht-core/shared-libs`. This task wants you to create another shared library called `constants` where all the constants of `cht-core` will be stored as a single source of truth.\n\n1. Create a new folder in `cht-core/shared-libs` called `constants`.\n2. Create a new folder `src` inside the folder created above with an `index.js` file.\n3. Create a `package.json` file inside the `constants` folder. Add some mandatory fields like `name`, `version`, `description`, etc. Other shared libraries can be a good reference for this. Keep this file minimal.\n4. Start adding constant values in the `src/index.js` file. Refer to this [comment](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/9621#issuecomment-2464647266) as to what values are to be converted to constants. Also, you can do some research and add constants as required.\n5. Replace the values in the code with the `constants` library values. The way to use a library from a shared library is:\n    ```javascript\n    const constants = require('@medic/constants');\n\n    // use\n    constants.a;\n    constants.b;\n    ...\n    ```\n6. After you replace a value in the `cht-core` code, with a constant value, be sure to run the tests to make sure that nothing has changed. The tests can be run using the `npm` commands: `npm run integration-all-local` for integration tests, `npm run unit` for unit tests and `npm run wdio-local` for automation tests.",

      "description" : "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### New feature\n\nHello maintainers, thank you for building a tool that makes curating datasets less tedious! \n\nI recently started to integrate nipoppy for curation and processing of imaging data, and I came across`\"Cannot move file because it already exists\"` error with the `nipoppy reorg` command. The DICOM files I'm working with are named identically across different sequences. For example, `sub-A/ses-1` have the following (partial) directory tree:\n\n```bash\nsub-A/ses-1\n????????? S10010\n??????? ????????? I10\n??????? ????????? I11\n????????? S1010\n??????? ????????? I10\n??????? ????????? I11\n????????? S11010\n??????? ????????? I10\n??????? ????????? I11\n????????? S12010\n??????? ????????? I10\n??????? ????????? I11\n????????? S4010\n??????? ????????? I10\n??????? ????????? I100\n??????? ????????? I1000\n??????? ????????? I10000\n??????? ????????? I100000\n??????? ????????? I100010\n??????? ????????? I100020\n??????? ????????? I100030\n??????? ????????? I100040\n??????? ????????? 100050\n??????? ????????? I100060\n\n```\n\nWith help from @michellewang on discord, I was able to resolve it by renaming the files to be unique by prefix-ing the sequence directory name as follows:\n\n```bash\nsub-A/ses-1\n????????? S10010\n??????? ????????? S10010_S10010_I10\n??????? ????????? S10010_S10010_I11\n????????? S1010\n??????? ????????? S1010_I10\n??????? ????????? S1010_I11\n????????? S11010\n??????? ????????? S11010_I10\n??????? ????????? S11010_I11\n????????? S12010\n??????? ????????? S12010_I10\n??????? ????????? S12010_I11\n????????? S2010\n??????? ????????? S2010_I10\n??????? ????????? S2010_I11\n????????? S3010\n??????? ????????? S3010_I10\n??????? ????????? S3010_I11\n????????? S4010\n??????? ????????? S4010_I10\n??????? ????????? S4010_I100\n??????? ????????? S4010_I1000\n??????? ????????? S4010_I10000\n??????? ????????? S4010_I100000\n??????? ????????? S4010_I100010\n??????? ????????? S4010_I100020\n??????? ????????? S4010_I100030\n??????? ????????? S4010_I100040\n??????? ????????? S4010_I100050\n??????? ????????? S4010_I100060\n```\nI'd be happy to make the necessary contributions to the codebase to include this renaming feature if y'all think its a good idea. I'm not sure how common this issue is but our scanners at NIMHANS seem to be set up this way. \n\nThanks! \n\n### Unclear documentation\n\n_No response_",

      "description" : "### Apache Airflow version\n\nmain (development)\n\n### If \"Other Airflow 2 version\" selected, which one?\n\n_No response_\n\n### What happened?\n\nWhile further looking at https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/53401, I am trying to understand more the spans and traces config. It came to observance that span queries are still happening although traces is disabled.\n\nThe Airflow scheduler continues to:\nupdate span_status on dag_run and task_instance, and\nexecute, every scheduling loop, a query that scans those tables for\n```\nWHERE span_status = 'should_end'\n```\n\nThis adds an unnecessary SELECT ???  every loop; on large task_instance tables, it showed up in `pg_stat_activity` with noticeably slow queries until we added an index on `span_status`\n\nImpact:\n- Unnecessary DB queries during Scheduler operations\n- Performance degradation in environments where tracing is not used\n- Missed heartbeats due to blocking/slow queries\n\n### What you think should happen instead?\n\nI was checking the latest main branch and noticed, for example, that the [call](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blame/912ccace3532e3c05a46f6a1cf9457c0de41db6b/airflow-core/src/airflow/jobs/scheduler_job_runner.py#L1280) to the `_end_spans_of_externally_ended_ops()` method doesn???t appear to check whether tracing is enabled in the config. From what I can see, the Scheduler calls this method unconditionally.\n\nThere may be other similar cases, but in general, it would be good to ensure that no span-related logic or queries are executed when tracing is disabled (which is the default setting).\n\n### How to reproduce\n\n1. Start up an Airflow deployment with the default configuration (i.e. tracing disabled).\n2. Observe the database activity ??? span-related queries are executed during the Scheduler operation, even though tracing is disabled\n3. If the task_instance table contains a large number of records, these span-related queries can become slow and degrade performance (until [this issue](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/53401) is addressed).\n4. These queries can be easily identified in the query logs or by profiling the database.\n5. Adding info logs to the `_end_spans_of_externally_ended_ops()` method would further confirm that it???s being invoked unconditionally (I haven???t tried this yet, but it???s straightforward to trace through the code and verify the call path).\n\n### Operating System\n\nLinux\n\n### Versions of Apache Airflow Providers\n\n_No response_\n\n### Deployment\n\nAstronomer\n\n### Deployment details\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Are you willing to submit PR?\n\n- [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n",

This is a great opportunity to test my abilities.", "@wesleykebrown Sounds great!", "I've been working on this for a while locally and wanted to ask some questions!\n\nQuestions I have for solution paths:\n\n1. Could the tests be modified to use `pollToPromise`?\n1. With the image urls, there's a nested call in generated functions from `createTexture2DUpdateFunction` ([here](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/blob/main/packages/engine/Source/Scene/Material.js#L787C10-L787C39)]. When interacting with `_loadedImages`, this function's path can either be synchronous or asynchronous. The asynchronous path has potentially multiple `.then` calls, which is probably what's causing the test issue. For improving this, should this and its parent functions be refactored to have a split async/sync path depending on if there's a \"url\" passed as an arg to a constructor? This would be a lot of refactoring.\n1. The variant of above is making every function async and returning the promise chains but that's even worse.\n\n<details>\n<summary>\nQuestions I have for code understanding in this starbucks (hidden cuz its like, optional and I'm fun)\n</summary>\n\n1. I've been reading the [coding guide](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/blob/main/Documentation/Contributors/CodingGuide/README.md) & I wanted to ask where this `Material` falls in the range of low-level to high-level\n1. From the coding guide, it suggests writing code similar to what already exists. Unfortunately, for the `fromUrl` results in the repo, they're wildly different implementations. Mine more closely resembles [the more recently updated one of them](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/blob/main/packages/engine/Source/Scene/SingleTileImageryProvider.js), but it is postfixed with `Provider`, and I wasn't sure if that had any implications\n1. I saw in the op the example fix has a parameter structure breaking with the `fromUrl` tradition: having `url` be the first param. Would it be ok to have `url` be the first param or was that intended as its considered `image` as a nested property within the `Material` spec?\n1. Also looking at other implementations of fromUrl, they're all public. Since the intention here is for improving testing, would it make sense to break from that here and have it be private or no?\n</details>\n\nThanks", "we are actually facing a similar challenge, but in a custom material using fabrics. would your solution also work for this?\n\ni hacked a quick prototype where i used an `imageLoaded` event that would emit on `update` for every loaded image with the uniformId. the benefit of this, i thought, was a) that i can change the uniform and wait for the new texture to be loaded again without having to create a new material and b) the code changes where minimal: a total of three lines. BUT, you have to actually call update on the material. \n\nmaybe there is an inbetween solution that could take care of both the `await Material.fromUrl('my.png')` and `new Material({ fabric: { type: 'MyFabric', uniforms: { tex: myCanvas }, source: '' } })`. ", "If the only purpose of `Material.fromUrl` is to make unit testing easier, why don't we instead make some sort of `imageReady` flag and event that Material creators can listen for? Unit tests could enter a poll loop on the ready flag, or register a listener which performs the `expects` validation steps.\n\nI could see it being useful in other places in the codebase to have a flag that indicates an image is loaded. On the other hand - do we have use cases where we'd want to asynchronously load an image from a URL?", "This sounds related to (although not \"the same as\") the changes that had been done in https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/blob/main/CHANGES.md#1107---2023-07-03 . There, the move was generally to change existing cases of \"ready flags\" and events into actual promises, but no strong opinion on the `Material.fromUrl` case from my side.\n ", "I see. In that case, maybe we should just store an array of promises (of images to load) in the material class, and expose a public getter so that users can await those promises? Users can continue to make materials as before - via the constructor or `.fromType` - but can subsequently await the images loading.\n\nWe could also then allow users to (optionally) pass in functions to call on resolving the promise, etc.", "I might be lacking some context for the Material API in particular. It sounds like the suggested `Material.fromUrl` function is not _necessarily_ intended _only_ for tests, but could also be useful in other contexts. Conversely, people might want to have finer control, to optionally wait for (and/or be informed about) the image loading process, but I might be lacking the imagination about why they could want this. For the example of\n```\n  primitive.appearance.material = Material.fromType(\"Image\", { \n    image: \"./Data/Images/Blue.png\"\n  });\n```\nit looks like it can hardly make sense to use this material _without_ the image (this could cause... you know... some white flashing and such \uD83D\uDE2C ). But I think that images can also be \"composed\" and contain _multiple_ external images, and being able to track this with dedicated promises for each image sounds pretty involved (for the implementation, _and_ for the client who wants to use it).\n\nFrom the description until now, it sounds like a \"blanket\"-function like `fromType`**`Async`** could make sense: It creates whatever has to be created, returns a promise, and when it's done, it's done. But maybe there are use-cases for the \"fine-grained\" promises as well.\n", "> dedicated promises for each image sounds pretty involved\n\nIs it? If the `Material` class holds an array of image promises that's gettable, couldn't the user simply `Promise.all(theArray)` to wait for all of them?", "I'm not necessarily arguing against an async constructor, for what it's worth. Just playing devil's advocate to try to understand *exactly* what we want here, before wasting effort building something we don't." ],

Instead of suggesting the correct function from the imported package, the compiler suggested an unrelated term.\r\n\r\n### Code to Reproduce:\r\n```gleam\r\nimport gleam/io\r\n\r\npub fn main() {\r\n  let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\r\n  debug(numbers) // Intended to use io.debug but mistakenly omitted 'io.'\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior:\r\nI expected the compiler to suggest using `io.debug` or another relevant function from the `gleam/io` package since it was imported and contained functions for console output.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior:\r\nThe compiler identified `debug` as an unknown variable and suggested unrelated terms, missing the opportunity to suggest the correct function from an already imported package.\r\n\r\n**Error Message**:\r\n```\r\nerror: Unknown variable\r\n  ?????? /path/to/project/src/my_project.gleam:5:3\r\n  ???\r\n5 ???   debug(numbers)\r\n  ???   ^^^^^ Did you mean `True`?\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Suggested Improvement:\r\nEnhance the compiler's error suggestions to consider functions available in the imported modules/packages, especially when an unknown function or variable matches a name in those imports. This feature could significantly improve developer experience by providing more contextually relevant suggestions and reducing potential confusion, particularly for newcomers or in cases of simple typos.\r\n\r\n### Additional Context:\r\nThis issue arose when I tried to print a list of numbers without correctly specifying the `io` module prefix for the `debug` function. The current compiler suggestions did not help in guiding me towards the correct usage of imported functions.\r\n\r\n**Gleam Version**: 1.0.0\r\n**Operating System**: macOS Ventura (Version 13.2)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/assets/59015064/416ccaa9-f464-44dc-8230-fc01270b6d57)\r\n\r\n",

I saw that #2715 was closed due to inactivity and it seems not that hard, a really good first issue to explore the codebase !\n\nHowever, there has been a little change since Gleam v1.0.0 and I don't know from which version this behaviour has changed.

Let me know if you'd like a breakdown of my approach before I begin!\n\nThanks! ", "Hi @adityai0 I would like to contribute to this issue so could you pls assign this issue to me \n\nMy approach - \n- first to create a /solutions page where a user can search for the solutions for the challenges \n- add the routes to it\n- later add an area below the solution where user can see the most recent comments stored in local storage\n\nas for the like and dislike there would be buttons with the thumbs up and down which when pressed add to its respective\nso could you pls assign this issue to me\n" ],

A couple things that I have found myself struggling / unable to really figure out personally would be:\r\n\r\n- sync (steep learning curve and ran into a lot of roadblocks with implementing but might be due to lack of experience on my end)\r\n- writer methods (nothing seemed to happen)\r\n- cascade deletions on related tables without having to manually do so\r\n\r\nA troubleshooting page of common problems (like https://github.com/Nozbe/WatermelonDB/pull/615) and a FAQ (dealing with the sync when offline, possibility of multiple relations to the same table, expo related questions, etc) would be useful as well. Also, there's someone with a PR open that is trying to add info to the observables section: https://github.com/Nozbe/WatermelonDB/pull/1447 which might be good as well\r\n\r\nI'll try to put together an example project that does the full front and backend sync if I can get some free time haha. It would be nice if people could submit their own example projects too and that way there could be a couple different kinds of examples (simple & complex) \r\n\r\n\r\nAlso the demo is down: https://github.com/Nozbe/WatermelonDB/issues/1415#issue-1420236273\r\n\r\n---\r\nSome other things I noticed were that the migrations page is under the Advanced section but says:\r\n> Without migrations, if a user of your app upgrades from one version to another, their local database will be cleared at launch, and they will lose all their data.\r\n> ?????? Always use migrations!\r\n\r\nIf it is essential, I think it should be moved up closer to setup. My idea for sections with the current information would be something like:\r\n\r\n- About (1.1)\r\n   - All the sections could probably be split into separate pages for readability and easier navigation\r\n- Setup (2.1 - 2.4 + 3.1)\r\n- Usage (2.5 -2.9)\r\n- Sync (its own section)\r\n- Troubleshooting\r\n- FAQ\r\n- The rest of the current sections seem good as is (maybe the LokiJS & web implementation should get their own section but I don't use it so I'm not quite sure)\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think!\r\n\r\n---\r\nAlso, not sure if there are any other maintainers (with privileges to merge in PRs & close issues) on the repo? As far as I could tell, it's just you? Not sure if this is an option for \uD83C\uDF49 since it's a Nozbe repo but having more maintainers would probably help. I could probably put in a PR at https://github.com/pickhardt/maintainers-wanted if you were looking for active maintainers or just pin an issue to recruit some.", "I want to help too, do you have anything in mind related to how it should be structured in the repo?\r\n\r\nThe current setup has the docs-master/ with the .md files and the generated docs/ folder.\r\n\r\nCan it be changed to something like the structure found in the [react-native-navigation](https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation/tree/master/website) repo, it features the API reference you mentioned or even [react-native-website](https://github.com/facebook/react-native-website)\r\n\r\nBoth of these examples also have versioning, is that something useful here?", "@ErickLuizA Yes, I'd like to change the structure a bit, it seems to confuse a lot of people that docs-master/ is the current version of docs that matches code on master, while `docs/` matches the latest published version.\r\n\r\nRegarding versioning, it's a nice to have, but not super important to me.

Things have changed since 2018, and I think we can now assume that most people use TypeScript/Flow, and whoever doesn't can just ignore them\r\n- Changing navigation to be closer to your suggestion seems like a good idea\r\n", "@radex Will do, I'll try to get to it as soon as I get some free time!", "> About the generate docs from source code, there are some solutions, I tested the [jsdoc-to-mdx](https://github.com/naver/jsdoc-to-mdx), it appears to work, although I kind of just put some text and see if it outputs something, if you wanna check it out, it's in this [branch](https://github.com/ErickLuizA/WatermelonDB/tree/migrate-docs-docusaurus-jsdoc), btw, for some reason, to work I need to put the comment in the .js and d.ts to work \uD83E\uDD14\r\n\r\n> There is [this gist](https://gist.github.com/slorber/0bf8c8c8001505f0f99a062ac55bf442) from the maintainer of docusaurus, but I was not able to make it run, there is also https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/3413, but it's for typescript.\r\n\r\n@ErickLuizA Can you help out with that? In general, JSDoc or something similar to annotate symbols with text seems good. JSDoc has the advantage that is has been around for a very long time, so even if one breaks, there's always going to be some tool to extract it and format it somehow.\r\n\r\nIt would be great not to have to duplicate types and just take function signatures automatically, and I think I've seen somewhere one-off scripts to help with that for Flow, but Flow just isn't that popular anymore, so it might be hard to maintain. Typedoc on the other hand looks interesting (though I don't really like how it formats the output), but I'm not sure it's a good idea to keep the main in-code documentation not in the main code but in the d.ts files.\r\n\r\nSo I think it would be great to start with a working demo of jsdoc-to-mdx, and then iterate from there", "I added some JSDoc comments to Database, Collection, etc. cc @ErickLuizA ", "Also to Model, Schema, sync", "I have not been able to open a PR with the API Reference because I didn't find a way to make jsdoc-to-mdx work properly\r\nI don't know why, but it has some problems with flow or the .d.ts files or both.\r\n\r\nI will try to work on another solution, maybe with [jsdoc-to-markdown](https://github.com/jsdoc2md/jsdoc-to-markdown), it does not work out of the box with docusaurus but it's more popular, I will see if it can work.", "I will help.", "@lucaswitch Much appreciated, do you need guidance as for where to start?", "I added JSDoc to Query class as well", "@radex Restructured and split up long sections here: https://github.com/Nozbe/WatermelonDB/pull/1535.

In theory we need to validate that only those fields are present. \n\nI'd set the highest priority on making sure we know how to generate a subset of this data and read it back in a valid form.\n\nFirst we need to create test cases and then we need to do the proper validations.\n\n2.2 requires validation of c2pa.metdata assertions.  This task is to support those validations \n\nSomewhere down the road we may want to test this by automatically moving metadata from XMP into one of these assertions.

I created #24244 before finding this issue.\n\n@SomeoneToIgnore, for the requirements/design what about enabling user config of a list of `path_regexes` to allow people to decide for their specific use cases what they would like to support. At least for rustc output cases, the paths are not surrounded in any well-known delimiters and in general I think we should support such cases. My local implementation currently uses regexes to identify lines which are well-known to end in a path, and captures that part of the line in a named capture. \n\n```\nconst RUSTC_DIAGNOSTIC_PATH_REGEX: &str = r#\"\\s+(at|:::|-->) (?<path>.+)$\"#;\nconst RUSTC_PACKAGE_PATH_REGEX: &str = r#\"\\s+(Compiling|Checking|Documenting) [^\\(\\n]+\\((?<path>[^\\)]+)\\)\"#;\n\n```\nThis is working well for me for rustc output. Thoughts on adding user config for providing regexes like these? Of course we can still add built-in support for well-known surrounding delimiters.", "I went ahead and put together a prototype to facilitate design/discussion/testing here: https://github.com/davewa/zed/tree/terminal-hyperlinks.", "Thank you for the prototype, much simpler to discuss things based on this.\n\nI see a few things worth highlighting:\n\n* Seems that we might want to unite custom regexes with the existing one: `[DEFAULT_REGEX]` or something in the settings.\nOne gotcha is that the default regex needs some `[path] -> path` special handling, but we hardcode that regex anyway hence when matching, can do extra checks for the default one.\n\n* Despite all the docs, it's totally unclear why do those regex settings exist: we might want to emphasize that this path capturing is for `cmd+click` and whatever matched will be checked for existence before opening (so, a \"bad\" regex capture is not guaranteed to be opened)\n\n* We might want to add some `log::debug!`/`log::info!` logging for the case when we matched, but the path was rejected after FS checks, to simplify the troubleshooting.\n\nNot certain, but also feel that we might want to fall back to URL capturing if nothing custom works?\n\n* Main concern: we seem to synchronously do the string matching with regexes in `process_terminal_event`, in a loop.\nThis seems quite dangerous, as we can block for quite a long time due to bad and/or abundant regexes.\nI think we need to test this bad case more, and, if things start to break indeed (I suppose this will look like \"cmd-hover onto some line, nothing else works for a few seconds, even resizing\"), we need to consider moving this match-in-for-loop to the background thread.", "Thanks for looking at my prototype and sending your feedback. I think I agree with all your points, but I'm not sure my prototype is the best approach. I've been thinking about your earlier comment that regex might not be the right solution, and I think you may be right. I have an idea for another approach that I think is better than my prototype in many respects (and which is probably similar to what you were thinking of when you mentioned nested quotes above...). I would like to discuss the design a bit more before I proceed further.\n\n**Design**\n\nThe below non-regex approach could be used for linkifying paths with spaces in the terminal without adding any user config, which seems like a big benefit.\n\n```rust\nlet focused = /* word under the cursor */;\nlet potential_start_words = &[/* all words on the same line up to focused */];\nlet potential_end_words = &[/* all words on the same line from focused to the last word */];\nlet linkified_path = /* longest string starting with a word in potential_start_words and \n    ending with a word in potential_end_words that is a valid path */;\n```\n\n**Benefits**\n- No configuration needed, it just works for most (all?) cases.\n- Handles nested quotes, parenthesis, etc.\n\n**Drawbacks**\n- Does a little more work in the default case (bounded by line length though). If this unacceptable, we could retain the existing behavior of checking the focused word first, and not check further if it is a valid path. Also other mitigations against pathological cases (e.g., very long lines) are trivial.\n- It is possible to match an existing file for a focused word that is not _meant_ to be a path, e.g. An existing file named \"hello to the world\" would be linkified in the sentence \"I would like to say hello to the world!\". I feel that this would be rare and also, _it matches the existing behavior_ ;), ...and is not solvable in a fully general way.\n\n**Considerations**\n- Given the potential drawbacks, it seems best to have this disabled by default, so we would need a setting value to explicitly enable it. I think it _would_ be nice to have it enabled by default, if that were deemed acceptable, but I'd rather have it opt-in than not at all.\n- The workspace could tell us if any path in the workspace contains spaces, and we could enable this behavior by default if it does. Of course, it could still be disabled in settings.\n- It would also be possible to match on strings enclosed in well-known (or user configured) path-surrounding characters; ' \" ( )\n- It seems desirable to find the longest match, but I could be wrong.\n\n", "Honestly, not sure I see any benefits over the regexes as, indeed, we seem to replace regex matching with more heuristics (checking for whitespaces in paths and removing the surrounding symbols) with more FS checks required for this.\nWe're not going away from regexes fully either, as we're forced to check for URLs at least.\n\nMaybe, I'm missing something and it's simple to prototype this to prove me wrong?", "From an implementation perspective, I see them about the same. Where I see real benefits of the non-regex approach are in usability and functionality. For usability, with the regex approach, everyone who wants this feature enabled has to figure out for their specific language and tools which regexes will work for them, and there are 100s of tools at least. Sure any given developer may only have 10s they are working with, but even that is cumbersome. Also, it is brittle; any change in the tools' output can break everyone's regex. For functionality, the regex approach doesn't work for nested quotes, (or ( ) [ ], etc.) or multiple paths on a line (e.g., the default output of `ls` wouldn't linkify). With the non-regex approach, the only configuration needed for everyone's toolset to just work is `enable_linkify_all_valid_paths = true`, it is not brittle, and it works in cases where regex is difficult or impossible. Seems like a good trade for a few extra `fs.exists()` calls, no? I'm happy to put together a prototype for the non-regex approach--I'll work on that and we can think it over in the meantime.", "I've pushed the new non-regex prototype here: https://github.com/davewa/zed/tree/terminal-hyperlinks-all-valid-paths\nSeems to work nicely. Also, as I was writing that up, I had another idea: _If_ we are willing to limit support to files belonging to the workspace, couldn't we utilize the existing index (???-p) for a cleaner solution?", "* Zed codebase prefers to avoid using `std::fs` wherever possible and use `trait Fs` instead: https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/6367754737a3fa4b93c32f8ebd9fe044859f441b/crates/fs/src/fs.rs#L79\n\nNote that this is async and won't work well with the event loop most probably.\n\n*\n> couldn't we utilize the existing index\n\nThat's what we do exactly: https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/6367754737a3fa4b93c32f8ebd9fe044859f441b/crates/terminal_view/src/terminal_view.rs#L851-L866\n\nOn top of that, we do check the relative paths for existence in the worktree the same way.\nNote that `terminal.rs` is architectured so that it does not know anything about Zed's internals including `Workspace`\n\nMoreover, this workspace index is not complete and will never include `excluded_files` and gitignored files deep in the tree (until their parents are expanded in the project panel or them/neighbors are opened first).\n\nSo this is not a solution, but still a good thing to try first before accessing the FS.\n\n\n* Do I understand right that `LINE_COLUMN_REGEX` assumes `:` as a separator always?\nThis will hurt MSBuild output format at least: https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/issues/15412 \n\nAlso, unfortunately, all `:`, `,`, `(`, `)` symbols are valid in paths of certain OSes:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ef04527-64e8-4c45-bc7c-93d1c568aa31)\n\nAs nowadays MSBuild is cross-platform, it can generate horrendous edge cases where `New File.txt(2)` could be both an existing file and a link to the 2nd line of another file.\n\nIn the new, generic system, how are we going to help both groups that want and do not want MSBuild in their systems?\n\n* Last but not least: traversing lines incrementally, matching them by regexes and doing synchronous FS API calls, totally ignoring existing `MaybeNavigationTarget::PathLike` and relative file resolution, all done in the event loop makes me not enthusiastic at all about the new approach.", "That's all really helpful feedback, thanks. For some of those points, I think we were already in a agreement--I am planning to do a lot more work on the prototype.\n\n>  So this is not a solution, but still a good thing to try first before accessing the FS.\n\nThis is great! I will update the prototype to integrate with the `terminal.rs` architecture and logic in `terminal_view.rs`\n\n> Do I understand right that LINE_COLUMN_REGEX assumes : as a separator always?\n\nIt does, and that is a bug...\n\n> In the new, generic system, how are we going to help both groups that want and do not want MSBuild in their systems?\n\nMy plan for this is the same as for the case of the path being surrounded by common symbols: check for the longest potential path, and if it is not a path successively strip off a small, well-defined set of common symbols and possible line/column suffix and check for each shorter variation.\n\n> Last but not least: traversing lines incrementally, matching them by regexes and doing synchronous FS API calls, totally ignoring existing MaybeNavigationTarget::PathLike and relative file resolution, all done in the event loop makes me not enthusiastic at all about the new approach.\n\nMy plan is to update the latest prototype to incorporate all your feedback thus far, including using async Fs, using the index before accessing the FS, integrating with the logic in `terminal_view.rs`, supporting the surrounded by common symbols case, and adding lots of tests.\n", "> and adding lots of tests\n\nNote that this might be hard due to 0 visual tests in Zed and 0 tests related to terminal (modulo regexes but even those are merely \"matches or not\" checks).\n\nGood luck nonetheless.", "I've updated https://github.com/davewa/zed/tree/terminal-hyperlinks-all-valid-paths to the point where I'd like additional review and feedback before continuing further. In my testing it is performing and working very well, but much more testing is needed. I do have one big \"kitchen sink\" test and a few other smaller tests, but there are many edge cases and nuance in this space so I am planning to write many more unit tests for specific cases. All the tests pass on macOS, Ubuntu, and Windows. I'm hopeful that we can reach consensus on the heuristic approach. The prototype currently has both the regex support and the heuristics in a unified design.", "Hey @davewa, I looked over your fork a bit, and I think it's looking pretty good overall. I think the best way to proceed is to create a pull request, mark it as a draft and ping me in the comments. That way we can continue discussing implementation details and see up to date diffs more easily. \n\nI'd also appreciate if you'd make sure the box is checked that says \"allow maintainers to edit the pull request\" as that usually helps make things go a bit faster and smoother. Thanks!", "Sounds good, thanks for looking at it! I'll get a draft PR going next week.", "Based on the discussions here and on #27218, I propose the following next steps:\n\n#### Add tests for existing functionality\n\nAs @SomeoneToIgnore points out near the [beginning of this issue](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/issues/12338#issuecomment-2155302926), the first PR(s) should be adding tests for existing functionality (no new functionality). I propose the tests would have input of a mock fs, mock worktree(s) (local and remote), terminal content, working directory, and hovered point. The output would include the hyperlinked match, all maybe paths checked, where they were checked (worktree or file), and any open target if one is found. These would be split between terminal and terminal_view crates and would include any refactoring necessary to enable testing. They should pass on macOS, Linux, and Windows. In order to make the tests maintainable, I've been looking into testing crates with support for snapshot testing, and [insta](https://docs.rs/insta/latest/insta/index.html) looks nice. I don't see it being used anywhere in Zed yet though? I feel this will be super helpful in improving maintainability, especially having different snapshot folders for different OSes, and potentially also for different levels of enabled functionality. The snapshot approach should also help keep build times fast as test coverage increases.\n\n#### Design new functionality\n\nThere have been some small comments/discussion on various threads--I'd like to write up the design in one place and check it in. My preference for this is a markdown document, with as simple a description of the requirements and design as possible, plus some illustrative examples.\n\n#### Implement new functionality\n\nOnce the design is complete, create small, focused PRs for each step of implementation. This may end up being exactly [as proposed by @SomeoneToIgnore](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/pull/27218#pullrequestreview-2710424964):\n- Support for regexes + background fs checks and timeouts\n- Support for levels of functionality, e.g., optional extended `/paths with spaces/` support\n\n(And also my proposal):\n- Reuse navigation target computed on hover for open\n\nAlthough after completing the design we may decide on a slightly different set of PRs.\n\nI'll be working on testing existing functionality next (with [insta](https://docs.rs/insta/latest/insta/index.html)).\n", "Hey @davewa, I appreciate the effort you're putting in to improve this area. \n\nI have one nit with what you have described here, however, and that is that I don't see a reason to make this more complicated than it needs to be. I think the important part here is just that we identify URLs & paths accurately and _quickly_ (as is reasonable). Once we have the path/URL, it seems trivial to figure out whether it's actually a path in the file system, or send it to the browser if it isn't. Additionally, as far as I can tell, we have had very few issues with the file path pointing to the wrong place (i.e. identifying the wrong file based on the path) so I really don't think testing this step is that important. Therefore, I personally don't see a reason why we would need mock file systems, or snapshot testing, when some simple `text input -> Option<URL>` tests would do just fine.\n\nBeyond just simplicity, however, my understanding is that snapshot testing, by definition, requires some way of \"fetching\" the previous snapshot. This would be a fairly substantial change to the way our testing and CI works currently, and is almost certainly not something that should be included as part of a small refactor such as this one.\n\n\n### Suggestions\n\nFrom my perspective, the reason that we're looking to improve/restructure this codepath, is that the current implementation is complex and hard to modify to extend it's functionality. \n\nWhat I'd be interested in is something along the lines of a simple `text in -> Option<URL>`  out structure. Where we have a few builtin parsers (preferably hand written rather than regex, but regex is fine) for the most common cases like `{path}:{row}:{col}`,  `https://{url}`, etc. With the capability for the user to define regex patterns themselves in their settings. \n\nWith that as the base, it becomes much simpler to just extract paths & URLs from terminal text as we come across them, filter the ones that don't exist out (based on the actual file system), link them to a location in the terminal, and reuse that parsed path/url when the user is hovering & subsequently requesting to follow it as you also mentioned. \n\nWith this structure, It also becomes much simpler to test, as we just need a string with a URL or edge case in it to test the URL extraction, and, if we end up wanting tests for the \"filter\" step, we can deal with MockFS or some other thing that makes sense (we already have ways to create _real_ temporary files/folders in tests) as needed.\n\nWith the user-provided regexes, we can also provide some example regexes for styles that are niche enough that they're not worth supporting natively, but worth making available to users in such a way that they just have to paste it in their settings. \n\nAnd, if we want to maintain the \"parse on demand\" behavior we have right now (where urls are only searched for once hovering occurs), that would require a very minimal change to what I've described so far, that being once the user hovers, we extract some bounded region around the cursor and try to parse.\n\nBut that's just my two cents, and is in not gospel in any way so feel free to disagree. I'm happy to create a rough first draft of the first steps (extracting out the current implementation to work on text rather than terminal grid) if my explanation isn't making sense for you.", "So far I've only refactored FindHyperlink processing in terminal.rs (just to improve it's testability). I haven't done anything with mocks or insta yet. I share your desire for simplicity, and excluding paths with spaces, I think something like what you suggest would be nice. How about this: I add some simple tests for existing functionality to my refactoring of FindHyperlink, and share those before doing anything else? I can post another draft PR if that is the preferred workflow. I think the test coverage is the most important thing that is lacking currently, and looking at actual tests is a great way to build a common understanding of what the use cases are and how much complexity is actually necessary to support those. Currently on stable for example, any path with a unicode character not matched by `\\w` in it is failing to linkify for me--that seems like something that really should never be broken. As far as testing just text input, I'm worried that would miss coverage of scenarios that are cell-specific, for example with single unicode characters that are two cells wide (the char in the first cell and wide char spacer in the second cell). How would we write a test which asserts that the link underlines both cells? I'm just learning about how this is handled in alacritty, so my understanding of this is probably not complete, but it does seem like something that should have test coverage.", "I should note that my original regex approach does of course work for _some specific_ paths with spaces cases, and we could add (or allow users to add) a regex for each case, i.e., cargo output, rustc diagnostics, python diagnostics, various forms of ls/dir output, etc.. This could end up being a long list of regexes for some people. The heuristic approach in #27218 is required for 1) enabling entire classes of these types of use cases _by default_ and also 2) some use cases which would be extremely difficult (impossible?) with regex. I totally understand if we're not interested in 1) or 2), and I'd be happy to proceed with the regex approach first, get that merged, and then contemplate the demand/cost/benefit of doing further work on the heuristic approach after that. There is also the separate issue of ambiguous cases, e.g., do we want to add support for actual paths that parse into paths with positions? That should be treated as a completely separate issue.", "I published a prototype branch here: https://github.com/davewa/zed/tree/terminal-hyperlink-tests\n\nI like that it gives us coverage of the code in `HyperlinkFinder::find_from_grid_point`, which seems fiddly and likely to change. Alacritty RegexSearch does appear to always return matches that do not start or end in-between a wide char and its spacer(s), so those test are probably overly paranoid (although there are some edge cases there which I have not checked yet). If this prototype branch seems like something people would be interested in discussing further and moving forward with, I'd be happy to create a draft PR. If not, I can rework it to only test the regexes, and the match post-processing for row/column/description.\n\nAlso, I'd like to propose splitting this issue into two distinct issues:\n\n1. Hyperlink navigation for paths with unicode characters that don't match `\\w` (which is a much simpler one to fix, and would enable Mojo, for example)\n2. Hyperlink navigation for paths with spaces", "Perhaps it would be helpful to summarize where I think we are with this? I clearly went a little overboard by fixing a lot of separate issues at the same time in #27218:\n\n1. (this issue) Paths with unicode characters that don't match `\\w`\n2. (this issue) Paths with spaces\n3. Adding a setting for user regexes for identifying paths and optional positions\n4. Ambiguous paths, i.e., `~`,`/a`, `/b`, `:4:2`, `(4,2)`, `'hello.rs'`, etc., are all valid real paths, but we parse them as special cases\n5. Reusing open target computed for hover when navigating\n6. Supporting all valid paths for each OS, e.g., many valid Linux paths are invalid Windows paths\n\nI feel that each of these should be separate issues (even though some do overlap a bit), each with their own cost/benefits/tradeoffs which we may or may not deem worth fixing. I think it would be nice to start with the simplest which have the most consensus (1, 3, and 5?) and then look at the others.", "> for example with single unicode characters that are two cells wide (the char in the first cell and wide char spacer in the second cell). How would we write a test which asserts that the link underlines both cells?\n\nI think this is the kind of thing we should fix when it becomes a problem. My intuition is that it's very rare for this to even occur, and not worth structuring our  solution / testing around (not saying that you are, just to illustrate the point). Worth keeping in mind for sure, so we don't back ourselves into a corner, but not something to super worry about is my takeaway.\n\nThanks for the summary @davewa, very helpful! I also completely agree. I think 1,3, and 5 are a great place to start. I also took a look at your branch and I think it's a great first step. Feel free to open a PR for it once you're ready. We should also probably create a discussion for this to avoid polluting / pinging people on this this issue. \n\n", "Ok, created a discussion: [Terminal Hyperlink Detection Refactor ?? zed-industries/zed ??

      "repositoryName" : "kopia/kopia",
      "description" : "I'm pretty new to kopia and really impressed! In general the documentation is really good and easy to understand fro me. Thank you very much for all you work!\r\n\r\nHowever, now I tried to setup a kopia server and there are some things I missed at https://kopia.io/docs/repository-server/ so these points could be improved. (I might provide a PR for the documentation ... once I understand the details ... :smiley:)\r\n\r\n* Explain the process of setting up a kopia server\r\n  * Explain requirements to run a server\r\n  * `kopia server start`, link to https://kopia.io/docs/reference/command-line/common/server-start/\r\n  * Explain TLS setup (*)\r\n  * Remember to open the port in case a firewall is used (e.g. on linux with ufw using: `sudo ufw allow 51515 comment 'kopia server via https'`)\r\n  * Create user accounts\r\n  * Will the server start automatically on machine boot (e.g. register a service)? Or do I need to do this myself?\r\n* It seems that `kopia server start` does not start the server in the background, but instead provides the server itself. I did expect it otherwise, so it might be mentioned. I guess now, the server won't be started automatically then, right?\r\n* what does `kopia server snapshot` (cancel / pause / resume) do? I don't understand the explanation on https://kopia.io/docs/reference/command-line/common/server-snapshot/\r\n\r\n(*) Could it be that the headings level got messed up? It looks like \"Auto-Generated TLS Certificate\" is a sub heading of \"Configuring Allowed Users - Kopia v0.7\":\r\n\r\n* [Configuring Allowed Users - Kopia v0.8](https://kopia.io/docs/repository-server/#configuring-allowed-users---kopia-v08)\r\n* [Configuring Allowed Users - Kopia v0.7](https://kopia.io/docs/repository-server/#configuring-allowed-users---kopia-v07)\r\n  * [Auto-Generated TLS Certificate](https://kopia.io/docs/repository-server/#auto-generated-tls-certificate)\r\n  * ...\r\n\r\nBut when I read more carefully, it talks about kopia v0.8 as well, so I guess there is a top level heading missing?\r\n\r\n-----\r\nSome more experiences during my first steps, as hints how the documentation could be improved:\r\n\r\nHow can I print the fingerprint again in case I missed to write it down when it was created?\r\n\r\nOnce I started a kopia server, I try to connect (on server machine):\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ kopia server status --server-cert-fingerprint xxx\r\nkopia: error: unable to list sources: 400 Bad Request, try --help\r\n```\r\nThis error message is not really helpful and should at least be explained.\r\nBut when connection from a remote machine this **did** work:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ kopia repository connect server --url https://<server>:51515 --server-cert-fingerprint xxx\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I try to get the server status from a remote machine, this fails as well:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ kopia server status --address https://<server>:51515 --server-cert-fingerprint xxx\r\nkopia: error: unable to list sources: 401 Unauthorized, try --help\r\n```\r\n\r\n(BTW: Seems to be inconsistent to use `--address` here and `--url` at other places. Or does it have different semantics?)\r\n\r\nAlso, when I try to open the server web UI in a browser, the credentials I created before using `kopia server user add` are not accepted.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWhen I try to sync a local repo to the server I also get an error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ kopia repository sync-to server --url https://<server>:51515 --server-cert-fingerprint xxx\r\nkopia: error: expected command but got \"server\", try --help\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs syncing to a server not supported or did I miss something here? It did work when I tried `filesystem` or `sftp`.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n$ kopia --version\r\n0.10.7 build: 5d87d817335f6d547e094ab80062113dc3a1fdf4 from: kopia/kopia",

The server seems to be variously broken and/or very problematic to work with. I've spent the last couple of days beating my head against the server with the following results:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIt's confusing that some `server` commands accept control params for directly accessing a remote server (also noting the inconsistent use of the params `--url` and `--address` accross various subcommands, as above), whereas others do not, and appear to require connecting to a repository before they can be used. This can maybe be aided by documentation, but the CLI would be much more usable if all server operations were implemented on the control API, or alternatively (and much less preferably), operations that actually operate on the respository were put under a nested subcommand, ie `server repository users list` or something.\r\n\r\n---\r\n \r\n- The `server status` command on the host does not work, always returns `400 Bad Request`.\r\n- The `server status` command executed remotely, using the correct control username and password returns `400 Bad Request`\r\n- The `server status` command specifies that it reads the env vars `KOPIA_SERVER_USERNAME` and `KOPIA_SERVER_PASSWORD` as the values for the args `--server-control-username` and `--server-control-password` respectively, however the variables for the control user when starting the server are `KOPIA_CONTROL_USER` and `KOPIA_CONTROL_PASSWORD`, resulting in conflicts for configuration via env.\r\n- The KOPIA_CONTROL_USER variable name is inconsistent with the KOPIA_SERVER_USER*NAME* variable name (and the latter format should be preferred as it's consistent with the argument names `--server-control-username`/`--server-username`).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n- The `server refresh` command on the host does not work, always returns `400 Bad Request`.\r\n- The `server refresh` command executed remotely, using the correct control username and password returns `400 Bad Request`\r\n- The `server refresh` command specifies that it reads the env vars `KOPIA_SERVER_USERNAME` and `KOPIA_SERVER_PASSWORD` as the values for the args `--server-control-username` and `--server-control-password` respectively, however the variables for the control user when starting the server are `KOPIA_CONTROL_USER` and `KOPIA_CONTROL_PASSWORD`, resulting in conflicts for configuration via env.\r\n- The KOPIA_CONTROL_USER variable name is inconsistent with the KOPIA_SERVER_USER*NAME* variable name (and the latter format should be preferred as it's consistent with the argument names `--server-control-username`/`--server-username`).\r\n\r\nIt's possible all the control-api commands produce these results, but the above two are the ones that I tested.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI could not find any way to get both the CLI and the server to see that they're connected to a repository other than to first create the repository from the CLI (e.g. `kopia respository create ...`), then to log into the server web UI and connect the repository from there too. This is quite confusing - is the server not using the same configs as the CLI or something?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAfter creating a user via `kopia server users add user@host`, connecting to the repository on a client `kopia repository connect server ...`, and receiving the expected response:\r\n\r\n```\r\nConnecting to server 'https://127.0.0.1:51515' as 'user@host'...\r\nConnected to repository API Server.\r\n\r\nNOTICE: Kopia will check for updates on GitHub every 7 days, starting 24 hours after first use.\r\nTo disable this behavior, set environment variable KOPIA_CHECK_FOR_UPDATES=false\r\nAlternatively you can remove the file \"/home/user/.config/kopia/repository.config.update-info.json\".\r\n```\r\n\r\nNo repository commands work:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ kopia snapshot create /home/user/tmp\r\nERROR failed to open repository: unable to establish session for purpose=: error establishing session: unable to initialize session: rpc error: code = PermissionDenied desc = access denied for user@host: EOF\r\nERROR open repository: unable to open repository: unable to establish session for purpose=: error establishing session: unable to initialize session: rpc error: code = PermissionDenied desc = access denied for user@host: EOF\r\n$ kopia snapshot list\r\nERROR failed to open repository: unable to establish session for purpose=: error establishing session: unable to initialize session: rpc error: code = PermissionDenied desc = access denied for user@host: EOF\r\nERROR open repository: unable to open repository: unable to establish session for purpose=: error establishing session: unable to initialize session: rpc error: code = PermissionDenied desc = access denied for user@host: EOF\r\n$ kopia repository status\r\nERROR failed to open repository: unable to establish session for purpose=: error establishing session: unable to initialize session: rpc error: code = PermissionDenied desc = access denied for user@host: EOF\r\nERROR open repository: unable to open repository: unable to establish session for purpose=: error establishing session: unable to initialize session: rpc error: code = PermissionDenied desc = access denied for user@host: EOF\r\n```\r\n\r\nMaybe this is because the `server refresh` command is broken and can't be executed, however restarting the server also has no impact, and `repository connect` succeeds so I suspect this is a more fundamental problem.\r\n\r\nI tried enabling ACLs but they made no difference.\r\n\r\n---\r\nSo my steps to this point, performed on Kopia v0.13.0 (I'm doing dev locally, so the server host here is a docker container, but AFAICT this is all equally valid for a hand-rolled server install):\r\n1. On server host, bring up server via `kopia server start ...`\r\n2. On server host, create local repository via `kopia repository create filesystem ...`\r\n3. On server Web UI, connect local repository\r\n4. On server host, create a user via `kopia server users add ...`\r\n5. On client, connect repository via `kopia repository connect ...`\r\n6. Fail\r\n\r\nAt this point I think I've exhausted all the options I can find as a user, without putting my dev hat on and going to try to hack the code. It doesn't help that the `debug` log level rarely seems to output anything more than the `info` level, which outputs the bare minimum - decent logging would probably make diagnosing this stuff vastly easier.", "Also some UX adjustments would be nice. For example `kopia server users add User@Host` will gladly prompt for a password, twice, only to stop you with\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ kopia server users add User@Host\r\nEnter new password for user User@Host:\r\nRe-enter new password for verification:\r\nERROR error setting user profile: username must be specified as lowercase 'user@hostname'\r\n```\r\n\r\nSame happens with `kopia repository connect server --url=http://somehost:51515`. It validates arguments only after prompting for credentials.\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ kopia repository connect server --url=http://localhost:51515\r\nConnecting to server 'http://localhost:51515' as 'username@hostname'...\r\nEnter password to open repository:\r\n\r\nERROR failed to open repository: invalid server address, must be 'https://host:port'\r\nERROR error connecting to API server: invalid server address, must be 'https://host:port'\r\n```\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs a side question: is there a reason why Kopia connects to the repository server over HTTPS only? I've seen a generic \"due to gRPC\" answer [here](https://kopia.discourse.group/t/cant-connect-to-insecure-repository-server/871/3), but no further explanation. There was an issue about the same topic, but it went stale: #1215. A quick google search reveals that gRPC can work over plain HTTP. See e.g. grpc/grpc-go#555", "I want to report that I am also experiencing \"permission denied\" errors when connecting to a Kopia server over TLS. Having followed the documentation quite closely.\r\n\r\n```\r\nkopia repo connect server --url=https://192.168.1.106:51515 --server-cert-fingerprint ####\r\n```\r\n```\r\n[info] ERROR failed to open repository: unable to establish session for purpose=: error establishing session: unable to initialize session: rpc error: code = PermissionDenied desc = access denied for ####@#####: EOF\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis error message occurs on the client (Windows 11), but on the server host (macOS) nothing comes up in the stdout.", "Also, can we get _actual_ docker environment variables instead of this command line argument stuff shoehorned into a compose file?\r\n\r\n```\r\nKOPIA_PASSWORD=\"<password-for-the-repository>\" \\\r\nKOPIA_SERVER_CONTROL_PASSWORD=\"<server-control-password>\" \\\r\n  kopia server start \\\r\n    --tls-generate-cert \\\r\n    --tls-cert-file ~/my.cert \\\r\n    --tls-key-file ~/my.key \\\r\n    --address 0.0.0.0:51515 \\\r\n    --server-control-username control\r\n```\r\n\r\nHaving to mix mounted volumes with absolute cert file paths when there are often already mount points for these is quite patchy and there is no reason to do so.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there should absolutely be documented accepted environment variables by the container like many other docker apps have.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/imagegenius/docker-kopia?tab=readme-ov-file#parameters\r\n\r\nhttps://immich.app/docs/install/environment-variables/\r\n\r\nand of course, no mention in the documentation to go the very common path of no-tls on a secure home network. The client works without it, but the server just throws errors that it is expecting TLS.\r\n\r\n`Connect Error: INTERNAL: internal server error: connect error: error opening repository: error connecting to API server: unable to establish session for purpose=: error establishing session: Session(): rpc error: code = Unavailable desc = connection error: desc = \"transport: authentication handshake failed: tls: first record does not look like a TLS handshake\"`", "I was wondering about \"GRPC needs TLS\" too, so I asked my friend ClaudeAI about it:\r\n\r\n> Let me clarify this:\r\n>\r\n>gRPC does not strictly require TLS (Transport Layer Security). You can run gRPC without TLS in what's called \"plaintext\" mode. However, using TLS with gRPC is highly recommended and considered best practice for several reasons:\r\n>\r\n>1. Security: TLS provides encryption and authentication\r\n>2. Modern browser requirements: Web browsers require TLS for HTTP/2, which gRPC uses\r\n>3. Production environments: Most production deployments require TLS for security\r\n>\r\n>You can use gRPC without TLS in:\r\n>- Development environments\r\n>- Testing scenarios\r\n>- **Internal networks where security requirements are different**\r\n>- Situations where performance is critical and the network is already secured\r\n\r\nBesides that there is this fingerprint being used to identify or validate the server, which would need a replacement when running without TLS.", "Official docs on how running a repository server it's like a dog chasing its nail. I know this is an open source free project but how is it possible that there's no one who can explain the correct sequence to have a repository server correctly up and running with some clients putting their snapshots there? I have faced all errors reported above and the best suggestion you have on the forum is to look at some YouTube videos... really? Clear documentation is a must and unfortunately many awesome open source projects have not it.", "Hello +1 here\n\n3h i fight with docs with help on AI to try to do (what i think should be) a simple case : to have root creating backups and one user to consult. with the recommandation to use a local Kopia Server.\n\nInfos are splitted in several parts and pages, melded with others infos.\nAnd for example \"starting a server page\" even don't mention the server start command.\n\nI think too that this kind of basic case should be covered simply in a one page. Like local userland only, local with Server and differents users (like root + users), local with docker, remote (if not simple to add the exception in other cases).\n\nI see the problem to provides one page full example of the most basics cases will lead to duplicate some informations in case to update (and then risk to forget to update one command or option change), but doc should be primary user-oriented, and not everyone able to read all the docs, identify all the subparts to take from all thos pages to make the global picture.\n\nOk, if someone wanna create a strange exceptional scenario, but not for a simple architecture.\n" ],

      "description" : "## What problem does this address?\n<!--\nPlease describe if this feature or enhancement is related to a current problem\nor pain point. For example, \"I'm always frustrated when ...\" or \"It is currently\ndifficult to ...\".\n-->\nMost of Block Editor components don't have stories.\nBlock Editor components's Storybook should also be added and updated like the Components.\nrelated #22891\n\n## What is your proposed solution?\n<!--\nPlease outline the feature or enhancement that you want and how it addresses any\nproblem identified above.\n-->\nWe can use this issue to track the addition and updating of the stories for Block Editor.\nYou can add the link to assign yourself to each component.\nAs I know, Block Editor Components list has never existed, so at first, we can start to be based on the directory name.\nThe list was made automatically, and we can ignore the component for native only.\n\nIf you cannot edit the list, please comment on which you made the PR for which directory's components.\n\ncc @WordPress/gutenberg-components \n\n## Best Practices\n\n### 1. Use CSF 3 format\n\nWrite stories as objects, not functions\n\n<details><summary>Do</summary>\n\n```jsx\nexport const Default = {\n\trender: function Template( { onChange, ...args } ) {\n\t\tconst [ value, setValue ] = useState();\n\t\treturn (\n\t\t\t<SomeComponent\n\t\t\t\t{ ...args }\n\t\t\t\tonChange={ ( ...changeArgs ) => {\n\t\t\t\t\tonChange( ...changeArgs );\n\t\t\t\t\tsetValue( ...changeArgs );\n\t\t\t\t} }\n\t\t\t\tvalue={ value }\n\t\t\t/>\n\t\t);\n\t},\n};\n```\n\n</details> \n\n<details><summary>Don't</summary>\n\n```jsx\nconst Template = ( { onChange, ...args } ) => {\n\tconst [ value, setValue ] = useState();\n\treturn (\n\t\t<SomeComponent\n\t\t\t{ ...args }\n\t\t\tonChange={ ( ...changeArgs ) => {\n\t\t\t\tonChange( ...changeArgs );\n\t\t\t\tsetValue( ...changeArgs );\n\t\t\t} }\n\t\t\tvalue={ value }\n\t\t/>\n\t);\n};\n\nexport const Default = Template.bind( {} );\n```\n\n</details> \n\n### 2. Consists of only one component\n \nThe purpose of Storybook is to test a single UI component itself. Therefore, unless there is a special reason, we should not include anything other than that component.\n\n### 3. Don???t create too many stories\n\nWhile it's tempting to expose as many variations of a component as possible, the behavior of the component can be changed in the Controls section.\n\nTherefore, additional stories should only be included if they involve significant visual or behavioral changes.\n\n### 4. About meta data\n\nTo display the source panel by default, specify `'shown'` in [the `meta.parameters.docs.canvas.sourceState` field](https://storybook.js.org/docs/api/doc-blocks/doc-block-canvas#sourcestate).\n\n<details><summary>Example</summary>\n\n```javascript\nconst meta = {\n\t// ...\n\tparameters: {\n\t\tdocs: {\n\t\t\tcanvas: { sourceState: 'shown' },\n\t\t\t// ...\n\t\t},\n\t},\n\t// ...\n};\n```\n\n</details> \n\nDefine the component description via the `meta.parameters.docs.description.component` field instead of a comment.\n\n<details><summary>Example</summary>\n\n```javascript\nconst meta = {\n\t// ...\n\tparameters: {\n\t\tdocs: {\n\t\t\t// ...\n\t\t\tdescription: {\n\t\t\t\tcomponent: 'Component description here...',\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t},\n\t},\n\t// ...\n};\n```\n\n</details> \n\nExplicitly define the type of props via the `meta.argTypes.{propName}.table.type.summary` field.\n\n<details><summary>Example</summary>\n\n```javascript\nconst meta = {\n\t// ...\n\targTypes: {\n\t\t// ...\n\t\tpropName: {\n\t\t\t// ...\n\t\t\ttable: {\n\t\t\t\ttype: {\n\t\t\t\t\tsummary: 'string',\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t},\n\t\t// ...\n\t},\n};\n```\n\n</details> \n\n\nFor private components, you may want to define the following fields to display the badge \uD83D\uDD12 ([Private APIs README](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/blob/trunk/packages/private-apis/README.md)).\n\nCheck [here](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/blob/f1fadbb036f1e702e3a28072444fd0de28a5dc02/packages/block-editor/src/private-apis.js#L57-L100) to see if the component is exported as private.\n\n<details><summary>Example</summary>\n\n```javascript\nconst meta = {\n\t// ...\n\ttags: [ 'status-private' ],\n\t// ...\n};\n```\n\n</details> \n\n### 5. Others\n\nIf the component you're working on doesn't have a README or JDoc, I'd appreciate it if you could do the following to clarify the component's implementation first:\n\n- If there's no README file: This is part of https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/22891. If the component already has JSDoc, you can use it to help write the README.\n- If there's no README and no JSDoc: You'll need to analyze the component's implementation and clarify the types of props and return types. See https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/22891#issuecomment-2543030487 for information on the JSDoc format.\n\n## Block Editor Components directories List\n\n\n<details><summary>Components List</summary>\n\nNote: \uD83D\uDD12 indicates that the component is private.\n\n\n\n- [x] alignment-control #67046\n  - `AlignmentControl`\n  -  `AlignmentToolbar`\n- [x] ~audio-player (for native only)~\n- [ ] autocomplete (`BlockEditorAutocomplete` based on `Autocomplete` from `@wordpress/components`.

I'm not saying we shouldn't be doing this but curious to lean what value you folks will be receiving from this ?\n\ncc @WordPress/gutenberg-core for awareness.", "I see a couple benefits from the maintainer side:\n\n- Improve engineering quality. Working in the isolated story when iterating on the component (as opposed to working directly in the Gutenberg app) promotes better engineering standards because it forces you to think about encapsulation, clear interfaces, etc.\n- Increase iteration speed. Having a story is much faster for discovery and testing different states. You don't have to dig around the app to see where the component is used, figure out what states exist, and how to reproduce them.\n\nI honestly don't know if there is pure documentation value for the extenders.\n\nI'd like to emphasize that we should write the stories in a way that **keeps maintenance cost at a minimum**. It will quickly become a net-negative if the stories incur a maintenance cost. For example, avoid hardcoded values as much as possible, and try to structure things in a way that will not need fixing when the underlying component code changes. Don't write unnecessary descriptions, as those are another thing that need to be updated manually when things change. Let's start with the simplest possible.", "As a plugin developer, I find Storybook extremely useful.\n\nWhen implementing a UI for a custom block or block editor, I can see what components are exposed, what props are supported, and how they work.\n\nWithout Storybook, it's hard to imagine how something would work unless I actually wrote the code while reading the documentation, or found a place in the Gutenberg repository where the component is actually used.", "I have looked at the PR linked to this issue and I think we need some kind of indicator to unify our implementations and approaches for contributors who are already working on this issue or are planning to work on it.\n\nBelow are my thoughts on best practices, but @WordPress/gutenberg-components, if there are any mistakes, please let me know.\n\n### Use CSF 3 format\n\nWrite stories as objects, not functions\n\n#### Do\n\n```jsx\nexport const Default = {\n\trender: function Template( { onChange, ...args } ) {\n\t\tconst [ value, setValue ] = useState();\n\t\treturn (\n\t\t\t<SomeComponent\n\t\t\t\t{ ...args }\n\t\t\t\tonChange={ ( ...changeArgs ) => {\n\t\t\t\t\tonChange( ...changeArgs );\n\t\t\t\t\tsetValue( ...changeArgs );\n\t\t\t\t} }\n\t\t\t\tvalue={ value }\n\t\t\t/>\n\t\t);\n\t},\n};\n```\n\n#### Don't\n\n```jsx\nconst Template = ( { onChange, ...args } ) => {\n\tconst [ value, setValue ] = useState();\n\treturn (\n\t\t<SomeComponent\n\t\t\t{ ...args }\n\t\t\tonChange={ ( ...changeArgs ) => {\n\t\t\t\tonChange( ...changeArgs );\n\t\t\t\tsetValue( ...changeArgs );\n\t\t\t} }\n\t\t\tvalue={ value }\n\t\t/>\n\t);\n};\n\nexport const Default = Template.bind( {} );\n```\n\n### Consists of only one component\n\nI think the purpose of Storybook is to test a single UI component itself. Therefore, unless there is a special reason, we should not include anything other than that component.\n\n### Don???t create too many stories\n\nWhile it's tempting to expose as many variations of a component as possible, the behavior of the component can be changed in the Controls section.\n\nTherefore, I think additional stories should only be included if they involve significant visual or behavioral changes.", "Additional Tips - To improve code consistency, I would personally be happy to implement the following rules for existing and future PRs:\n\nTo display the source panel by default, specify `'shown'` in [the `meta.parameters.docs.canvas.sourceState` field](https://storybook.js.org/docs/api/doc-blocks/doc-block-canvas#sourcestate).\n\n```javascript\nconst meta = {\n\t// ...\n\tparameters: {\n\t\tdocs: {\n\t\t\tcanvas: { sourceState: 'shown' },\n\t\t\t// ...\n\t\t},\n\t},\n\t// ...\n};\n```\n\nDefine the component description via the `meta.parameters.docs.description.component` field instead of a comment.\n\n```javascript\nconst meta = {\n\t// ...\n\tparameters: {\n\t\tdocs: {\n\t\t\t// ...\n\t\t\tdescription: {\n\t\t\t\tcomponent: 'Component description here...',\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t},\n\t},\n\t// ...\n};\n```\n\nExplicitly define the type of props via the `meta.argTypes.{propName}.table.type.summary` field.\n\n```javascript\nconst meta = {\n\t// ...\n\targTypes: {\n\t\t// ...\n\t\tpropName: {\n\t\t\t// ...\n\t\t\ttable: {\n\t\t\t\ttype: {\n\t\t\t\t\tsummary: 'string',\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t},\n\t\t// ...\n\t},\n};\n```", "I noticed that some components have the `__experimental` or `__unstable` prefix.\n\nI wondered if I should publish these components to Storybook, but some components with these prefix have already been published.\n\nIf the component has a proper README and code examples, I believe it's okay to publish it to Storybook.", "Thanks to everyone working on this issue. Although not directly related to this issue, I noticed that some components don't have a README or JSDoc.\n\nIf the component you're working on doesn't have a README or JDoc, I'd appreciate it if you could do the following to clarify the component's implementation first:\n\n- If there's no README file: This is part of #22891. If the component already has JSDoc, you can use it to help write the README.\n- If there's no README and no JSDoc: You'll need to analyze the component's implementation and clarify the types of props and return types. See [this comment](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/22891#issuecomment-2543030487) for information on the JSDoc format.", "Excellent team effort here.\n\n@t-hamano, your tips and suggestions should be included in the issue description.

About meta data\" section of this issue for more details.", "Update: I noticed that some components are internal and not public, so I updated the list. For internal components, it is marked as `(Internal) component`.\n\nWe need to consider whether to expose internal components to Storybook.\n\nIf we do, it may be useful for Gutenberg contributors, but it will not be useful for the extenders.\n\nPersonally, I don't think internal components need to be exposed. However, some PRs have already been submitted for internal components, so we will need to close them. Sorry, I should have noticed this sooner.\n\nI look forward to your comments.", "Unlike private components, I think there is no intention of publicizing internal ones, so exposing them doesn't make sense.", "Okay, so let's not add Storybook to the internal components.

This will cause me to send the problem directly after pasting. But in fact, I didn't finish writing. But when I stopped by esc, I tried to retrieve the previous conversation, but it disappeared, and I could never complete the pasting operation.\n\nAnother way is to copy and paste it into an unformatted part first, such as WIN+R to run the input box before copying and pasting it into cli. I think this is a very big problem and seriously affects development efficiency.\n\nI wonder if the last space can be automatically cleaned when pasting to prevent sending messages before editing is completed.\n\nNow as long as it involves me entering some text, and then I try to combine errors in multiple locations to ask questions. It can't be completed at all. I tried \\ enter shift, but it didn't work.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

Just keep a scratchpad file open in the same folder so that Gemini can access it. Then you can paste there anything, without worrying. Gemini then shall read it via `read_file` when you tell her to do so. Just keep that TXT file open in another window: `gedit`, `notepad` etc. one.  \nB.

      "description" : "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\n\nWhen I installed vimspector, I only really expected to use it every now and again (debugging real-time systems is usually better via a UART and gdb only comes out in desperate cases).  The \"Human\" mappings sounded sensible for general use, but I was then surprised that all my previous F-key mappings had disappeared - I expected them to appear when I first ran vimspector or did a `packadd` or something like that.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nInclude an autoload command called something like `vimspector#LoadMappings \"human\"` (perhaps with a default that can be saved in vimrc) that saves existing F-key mappings ([useful reference here](https://vi.stackexchange.com/a/7735)) somewhere and then installs the F-key mappings.  Also include an autoload command called something like `vimspector#UnloadMappings` that restores whatever you had before loading vimspector.\n\nLoading mappings could also be automatic when you first run a Vimspector command/function, but I wouldn't mind it being a (single) manual step.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\nFor now, I've removed the `g:vimspector_enable_mappings` thing from my vimrc, but that means that when I want to debug something I have to do one of:\n\n* Edit vimrc and then restart vim (which loses all the tabs, splits etc)\n* Manually do the mappings, then manually undo them when I'm done\n* Write my own function to do LoadMappings / UnloadMappings\n",

      "description" : "## Description  \n\nCurrently, we do not publish SNAPSHOT images for our stable branches. Having these available would allow QA to run nightly cross-component tests against the stable heads. In the future, this would also enable running new E2E smoke tests, reducing friction due to integration testing at release time and potentially cutting down on most of the manual testing required during a release.  \n\nThe `stable/8.7` branch already has a SNAPSHOT image due to the new dual 8.7 and 8.8 release strategy, but this was implemented as a one-off and uses the discouraged `8.7.0-SNAPSHOT` naming. This ticket aims to extend that approach to all stable branches, ensuring that every supported version has a corresponding SNAPSHOT image available for testing.\n\n## Expected Outcome  \n\n- Each stable branch (e.g., `stable/8.6`, `stable/8.7`, etc.) has a corresponding `X.Y-SNAPSHOT` image published for each component present on that branch:\n    - 8.5 and older only have Zeebe component\n- Images follow a predictable naming convention (e.g., `8.6-SNAPSHOT`, `8.7-SNAPSHOT`).  \n- The images [are documented](https://github.com/camunda/camunda/wiki/CI-&-Automation#available-snapshot-artifacts) for reference.  \n- The CI pipeline builds and publishes these images automatically.  \n- The approach is sustainable for future versions (align the existing implementation of `stable/8.7` branch with how it's done on all other branches).\n\n## Open Questions\n\n- What were the previous blockers to implementing this for all stable branches?\n- Are there any concerns regarding support for these images?\n- Should each product team handle their own SNAPSHOT builds, or should Infra own this process?\n\n## Related Discussions\n\n- [Slack conversation from March 19???25, 2025](https://camunda.slack.com/archives/C071KP5BTHB/p1742395590166449) (internal discussion on why we need stable SNAPSHOT images and how they would benefit QA).  \n- Reference implementation for `stable/8.7` ([GitHub Issue #27193](https://github.com/camunda/camunda/issues/27193)).  \n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Confirm the technical feasibility of extending the current `8.7-SNAPSHOT` implementation to all stable branches.\n2. Align on ownership (Monorepo Devops team vs. product teams).  \n3. Update the CI configuration to generate and publish the images.  \n4. Document the availability and usage of these images.  \n",

I acknowledge that this ticket is quite important but as visible on [this board](https://github.com/orgs/camunda/projects/115/views/1) there are other important topics that we need to do and can't keep pushing. I will see if I might have capacity in my personal backlog or if there is another team with capacity that can help out.", "Thanks for the confirmation, that makes sense! Totally understand that there are competing priorities at the moment. If it helps, I'm happy to assist with any context or input needed to keep things moving, especially since this would have a big impact on testing and release processes. ", "Hi @liliancavalet , thanks for taking this on!\n\nJust checking in to see if there???s an estimated timeline or update on the implementation now that the issue has been assigned.\nLet me know if there???s anything I can do to help move it forward.\n\nThanks!", "Hi @slolatte!\nSorry for the delayed reply. As we discussed today, this task will be the next one I???ll pick up. I???ll reach out to you soon to gather more information once I have some time to focus on it.", "Hi @slolatte! \n\nBefore I move forward with the implementation, I???d like to confirm my understanding of the goals and surface a few clarifying questions to ensure we???re aligned on scope, naming, and process.\n\n## Understanding of the Goal\n\nThe core objective is to publish Docker images tagged as `X.Y-SNAPSHOT` (e.g., 8.7-SNAPSHOT, 8.6-SNAPSHOT) for each supported stable branch in the monorepo, so they can be consumed by:\n\n- QA's nightly cross-component testing\n- Future E2E smoke tests during the release cycle\n\nThere???s already a one-off implementation for stable/8.7 that publishes a `8.7.0-SNAPSHOT` image, and I understand this:\n\n- Includes Git commit metadata in the image (e.g., via git.properties or /actuator/info)\n- Need to be improved by removing the patch-level naming (X.Y.Z-SNAPSHOT), which we now want to avoid\n\n## Plan Going Forward\n\n- [x] Replace X.Y.Z-SNAPSHOT docker tag with a standardized branch-level X.Y-SNAPSHOT tag\n- [ ] Ensure images are published on every merge to a stable branch (TBD)\n- [x] Maintain commit metadata in the image for traceability\n\n## Questions / Clarifications\n\n1. Just confirming that `X.Y-SNAPSHOT` is solely a Docker image tag, and has no relation to Maven Central SNAPSHOT artifacts, correct?\n2. Is this currently limited to the monorepo (e.g., Zeebe, Modeler, etc.), or are other components like Optimize, etc. expected to follow the same approach for their own `stable/X.Y` branches?\n3. Should a new `X.Y-SNAPSHOT` image be published:\n   a. Every time a PR is merged into a stable branch?\n   b. Or on a nightly schedule only?\n4. What should happen to the previous `X.Y-SNAPSHOT` image when a new one is published?\n   a. Should it be overwritten/replaced immediately?\n   b. Should we retain previous images for some period (e.g., to avoid breaking a test in progress)?\n   c. If a new image is pushed while QA is running a test on the same `X.Y-SNAPSHOT` tag, is there any expected coordination?\n   d. Should we assume ???latest image wins???, and the next test will simply consume whatever???s available at the time?\n   e. Do we need stability guarantees per test run (e.g., lock to the SHA/tag used at test start)?\n\nThanks in advance for the help!", "I can give input on some of the questions from my POV:\n\n> 1. Just confirming that X.Y-SNAPSHOT is solely a Docker image tag, and has no relation to Maven Central SNAPSHOT artifacts, correct?\n\nYup\n\n> 2. Is this currently limited to the monorepo (e.g., Zeebe, Modeler, etc.), or are other components like Optimize\n\nOptimize is part of the monorepo on newer versions (8.8+), hence the phrasing in the ticket description:\n\n>> Each stable branch (e.g., stable/8.6, stable/8.7, etc.) has a corresponding X.Y-SNAPSHOT image published for each component present on that branch:\n>>   * 8.5 and older only have Zeebe component\n\n> 3. a. Every time a PR is merged (_a commit is pushed_) into a stable branch?\n\nThat would be in line how we do it for `main` (and people expect it to work like that here) and `stable/8.7` so I'd appreciate the consistency and staying with the people's expectations.\n\n> 4. a. Should it be overwritten/replaced immediately?\n\nAgain yes from my side, since I'd appreciate that to have consistency with how `main` does it (and people expect it to work)\n\n> 4. c. If a new image is pushed while QA is running a test on the same X.Y-SNAPSHOT tag, is there any expected coordination?\n\nDocker caches images locally (on the same GHA run+runner only) so overwriting images in an upstream Docker registry is usually not breaking.", "I agree with all of @cmur2 comments and just to add to that from a QA POV we don't need to retain previous images for any period nor do we need stability guarantees per test run.

Probably console command should be updated to expect different range of numbers\r\n- With default settings some values above .7-.75 are cutting off hud rendering (usually stock).  Changing `src/xrEngine/device.h`  `#define VIEWPORT_NEAR 0.2f` to `#define VIEWPORT_NEAR 0.05f` helped me for most cases, but still  stock  rendering should be checked with extremely high FOV values near upper limits. + I am not also aware  which side effects changing of this value can cause\r\n",

Did you remember to add `id-token: write` to your workflow permissions?\n```\n\n\nThis was from the work we did on Saturday to integrate Claude for automatic PR reviews. The failure here is blocking even simple doc-only PRs, which should not happen.\n\nObservations:\nThe Claude code action is attempting to request an OIDC token but fails due to missing GitHub Actions environment variables.\nThe message clearly states the root issue: missing id-token: write permission.\nAlso observed: an additional \"Bad credentials\" error from a curl request, likely due to misconfigured GitHub authentication.\n\nSuggested Fixes:\n1. Update workflow permissions in the GitHub Actions YAML file:\n```\npermissions:\n  id-token: write\n  contents: read\n```\n2.Ensure any token-based API calls (e.g., with curl or Octokit) are using valid credentials or fallback tokens when id-token isn???t available.\n3.Graceful fallback in Claude review action for doc-only PRs , consider skipping OIDC token if unnecessary.\n\nNext Steps\n1. Add the correct permissions to the llm4s GitHub Action workflows.\n2. Confirm Claude action works on non-code PRs.\n3. Consider fail-soft behavior or bypass for documentation-only changes.",

This is because I just want to plot some waves rather than plotting a chart, but I am not sure how much additional overheads with using this library instead of using the built-in PlotLines. \n\nI think this issues should be opened because it doesn't really address the missing PlotLines function compared to the original imgui library, but a workaround that works similarly yet possibly not exact. Unless I am wrong about the built-in Plot Library.", "@Logickin-Lambda \nI think they use the same drawing primitives to build up the plot. However, the basic ones are possibly a bit more efficient, since they have less features. But if you want to know you'll have to benchmark them for your system. ( ???????????? ??????? )", "@taylorh140 Yeah, I think it is the time to pull out a test for it. Considering with the current solution:\n\n```\n        // The Vanilla \"PlotLines\" function doesn't exist in zgui, use the implot as a temporary solutions\n        zgui.plot.pushStyleVar2f(.{ .idx = .plot_padding, .v = .{ 0, 0 } });\n        if (zgui.plot.beginPlot(\"Samples\", .{ .h = 240, .w = 100, .flags = DefaultPlotFlag })) { // setting size to -1 enables auto sizing\n            zgui.plot.setupAxis(.x1, .{ .flags = DefaultAxisFlag });\n            zgui.plot.setupAxis(.y1, .{ .flags = DefaultAxisFlag });\n            zgui.plot.setupAxisLimits(.x1, .{ .min = -1, .max = 1 });\n            zgui.plot.setupAxisLimits(.y1, .{ .min = 0, .max = 100 });\n\n            // Trying to plot a vertical wave since it is more useful for my use case\n            zgui.plot.plotLine(\"vertical sample\", f32, .{ .xv = &samples, .yv = &time });\n            zgui.plot.endPlot();\n        }\n        zgui.plot.popStyleVar(.{});\n```\n\nComparing to this theoretical PlotLines function for zig:\n```\nzgui.plotLines(\"Samples,\" samples, 100);\n```\n\nThe later is much more simpler and without all the flag configuration for every iterations and the implementation is less noisy, which is good for showing some waveform on a synth or doing simple and plain oscilloscopes; however, if you see my former example, I did intended to print a vertical chart drawing the wave from top to bottom, so there is a chance that I have to use ImPlot instead of the native function which it seemingly only offers drawing chart from left to right.\n\nI might try to fork this repo and try to add that function for testing, but there is no guarantee I will do this shortly because I am still very new in this library and imgui in general which I need some time to understand how it works." ],

It seems to work the other way around as setting CAR as egress_mode successfully results in driving egress legs.\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n1. Create a transport_network instance with a valid OSM street network.\n2. Create a DetailedItineraries where access_mode is set to be either 'CAR' or 'CAR_PARK'.\n3. The default mode of WALK will still always be the 1st segment's transport mode\n\n**Expected behavior**\nI expect the best paths to have 'CAR' as first segment mode.\n\n**Environment:**\n - MacOS Sequoia 15.5 (M3 Pro)\n - Python package source: pip\n - Python 3.11.0, Java Development Kit 24.0.1\n\n**Additional Information**\nIt seems like the equivalent functionality in r5r works as intended, though instead of a separate _access_mode_ parameter, _mode=c(\"CAR\", \"BUS\")_ must be set instead.\n\n**Test data and/or script/notebook**\nJupyter notebook and test data attatched below.\n\n[r5py_bug_report.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20442258/r5py_bug_report.zip)\n\n.osm.pbf file was too large to upload, it can be fetched from [here](https://download.geofabrik.de/europe/estonia.html).",

      "comments" : [ "\n\nHi! I had a look at your custom `ManchuZhMT` model.  \nThe `ValueError: You cannot specify both decoder_input_ids and decoder_inputs_embeds at the same time` comes from the fact that your `forward` always passes `decoder_input_ids` to the Marian decoder, while **Trainer + PEFT (LoRA)** may inject a `decoder_inputs_embeds` entry into `**kwargs`. When both reach the decoder, Transformers raises that validation error.\n\n**Minimal fix in your custom model:** drop one of the two before calling `self.decoder` (keeping `decoder_input_ids` is the simplest). For example:\n\n```python\ndef forward(\n    self,\n    input_ids=None,\n    attention_mask=None,\n    decoder_input_ids=None,\n    decoder_attention_mask=None,\n    labels=None,\n    **kwargs,\n):\n    ...\n    # Remove conflicting argument if both are present\n    if \"decoder_inputs_embeds\" in kwargs and decoder_input_ids is not None:\n        kwargs.pop(\"decoder_inputs_embeds\")\n\n    dec_out = self.decoder(\n        input_ids=decoder_input_ids,\n        attention_mask=decoder_attention_mask,\n        encoder_hidden_states=enc_out.last_hidden_state,\n        encoder_attention_mask=extended_mask,\n        return_dict=True,\n        **kwargs,\n    )\n    ...\n````\n\nAfter adding this guard, `trainer.train()` should run normally and produce your LoRA checkpoint.\n\nIf you prefer using embeddings explicitly, you could instead set `decoder_input_ids=None` and keep `decoder_inputs_embeds`.\n\nLet me know if you???d like a small PR adding a defensive check on the library side; happy to help adjust anything if needed. Thanks!\n\n\n", "Opened PR #39566: **Ignore `decoder_inputs_embeds` when `decoder_input_ids` are present**.\n\nIt adds a small guard in `Seq2SeqTrainer.compute_loss` and a test to prevent the `ValueError`.  \nHappy to adjust if you prefer a different location for the fix. Thanks!\n", "@JoseAlvarezMedina \nThanks for your help. I edit my `ManchuZhMT` and add `kwargs = {}` (for debug).\n**However,** The `ValueError` still exists, So I found the code in `file transformers/models/marian/modeling_marian.py, line 992`:\n```Python\n        # retrieve input_ids and inputs_embeds\n        if (input_ids is None) ^ (inputs_embeds is not None):\n            raise ValueError(\"You cannot specify both decoder_input_ids and decoder_inputs_embeds at the same time\")\n        elif input_ids is not None:\n            input = input_ids\n            input_shape = input.shape\n            input_ids = input_ids.view(-1, input_shape[-1])\n        elif inputs_embeds is not None:\n            input_shape = inputs_embeds.size()[:-1]\n            input = inputs_embeds[:, :, -1]\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(\"You have to specify either decoder_input_ids or decoder_inputs_embeds\")\n```\nBy Debugging, I found that both my `decoder_input_ids` and `decoder_inputs_embeds` is `None`, as the screenshot below:\n\n<img width=\"1692\" height=\"1313\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90baacd7-588f-4422-af88-31f46c9ae097\" />\n\nSo maybe the ValueError is caused by the process that `Seq2SeqTrainer`  generate `decoder_input_ids`, or my JSONL Loader(below)?\n```Python\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\n\nmax_len = 256\nbatch_size = 16\n\nraw_ds = load_dataset(\"json\", data_files={\"train\":\"train.jsonl\",\"val\":\"val.jsonl\"})\n\ndef tokenize(batch):\n    model_inputs = manchu_tok(\n        batch[\"source\"],\n        max_length=max_len,\n        truncation=True,\n        padding=\"max_length\"\n    )\n    with chn_tok.as_target_tokenizer():\n        labels = chn_tok(\n            batch[\"target\"],\n            max_length=max_len,\n            truncation=True,\n            padding=\"max_length\"\n        )\n    model_inputs[\"labels\"] = [\n        [(t if t != chn_tok.pad_token_id else -100) for t in label]\n        for label in labels[\"input_ids\"]\n    ]\n    return model_inputs\n\ntokenized_ds = raw_ds.map(tokenize, batched=True)\n```\nIs there any solutions?

We understand that the current implementation of \"Show headers\" can feel somewhat cluttered due to the \"key: value\" format we use. However, reworking this screen is not currently on our roadmap.\n\nTo workaround this issue until we have time to rework the screen, as a good first issue, we can add a padding between each header item so it will enhance the headers' readability.\n\nWe could also explore using some indent for the header's value, however, we need to take into consideration the several device widths we support.", "Thanks for your proactive reply! I think your suggestion would not get to the essence of the requirement, so let me also try to help.\n\nHere, \"readability\" is not about aesthetics such as indentation or line spacing, but about an authentic display of the headers for debugging purposes. The milestone is that ```X-Spam-Report``` is readable.\n\nI've learned something from your reply, especially when combined with #5240. That the \"Show headers\" is working with internal key-values. They have already been parsed and processed.\n\nNow I understand that, I would suggest not making tweaks or complexity; I don't think it adds any value.\n\nThe reality is much simpler: viewing headers is most useful if it reproduces the ASCII text of the headers (everything in the internal data before the blank line).\n\nThat seems to be what Thunderbird's \"Show original\" feature is (and the equivalent in Alpine etc.) If there's anything that is malformed or would not parse, it should reproduce that too. Not even parsing 'keys' and 'values'. Newlines and spaces are just part of this piece of text.\n\nYou've correctly pre-empted the difficulty of displaying text which has 80 character width on smaller screens. My suggestion would be a fixed width font at 80 columns width (which I assume is still standard for the headers) and pinch the screen to zoom in or out (no word wrap)\n" ],

Is there anything Zen Browser does to the Firefox options that I have changed manually that could effect it?\n\nI manually change 'browser.enable_automatic_image_resizing' and 'browser.enable_click_image_resizing' in about:config within Firefox every time I have installed it. It is the only things I change in about:config. Maybe I haven't done this on my Linux yet; I have just started using it.\n\nDoes Zen Browser have options for theses toggles within the settings? Or does it come with these already modified?", "Zen has those in about:config. Both of them are true on Zen. I don't tweak any settings directly in about:config though, so I assume that's the default on Zen. I also still have a Firefox install and both of them are true as well. \n\nEdit: I just tried a fresh add-on install on Firefox. Without changing anything, the videos are not stretched. I changed \"Thumbnails per Row\" (General > Thumbnails) to 6, and videos are still not stretched. But importing the same settings from Zen to Firefox produced the bugs. Resetting the settings, the bug isn't produced. ", "Alright. So it must be a setting in our 'Improve YouTube!' addons. Something we changed a while back and is now causing the problem.\n\nI had an old settings backup from 12th October 2024 which I ported over to the Linux installed Firefox. I think it was before the issues with thumbnails. I have exported the Windows settings and had a look at the differences between them.\n\nHere is a list of the differences. The problem must surely be here:\n\n### **These below are new in the .json file. Changes I have made in the Windows version since the last backup, which are not in the Linux version**\n\n\"header_hide_logo\":false,\n\"header_position\":\"normal\",\n\"hide_clip_button\":\"hidden\",\n\"hide_save_button\":\"normal\",\n\"player_autoplay_button\":false,\n\"player_cinema_mode_button\":false,\n\"player_forced_volume\":false,\n\"player_loudness_normalization\":true,\n\"player_popup_button\":false,\n\"player_repeat_button\":false,\n\"player_volume\":9,\n\"remove_member_only\":true,\n\"title_version\":true,\n\n### **These below are the differences in settings that exist in both .json files**\n\n\"hide_share_button\":\"icons_only\", changed to \"hide_share_button\":\"hidden\",\n\"lastDarkTheme\":\"night\", changed to \"lastDarkTheme\":\"sunset\",\n\"lastLightTheme\":\"custom\", changed to \"lastLightTheme\":\"desert\",\n\"player_color\":\"amber\", changed to \"player_color\":\"default\",\n\"theme\":\"night\", changed to \"theme\":\"sunset\",\n\nThis is a good place to start I think.\n\nI also reloaded the old settings to the windows version and all seems to be fine with those settings, too. Which I was hoping would not be the case. Some interaction between settings and browser and OS makes it more complicated to diagnose.", "Ok so I fixed the Linux YouTube Playlists last night.\n\n- First, I backed up my settings from Windows Improve YouTube\n- Went to my broken Linux version\n- Opened Improve YouTube settings and clicked _backup&reset_ > _reset all settings_ \n- Opened a new tab and went to a playlist; it was fixed\n- Then I imported the settings I backed up earlier\n- Opened a new tab and checked the playlist and it still worked fine\n\nIt still worked today after booting up so looks like this fixed it for me.\n\nIf you backup your settings, reset them, then re-import them, checking playlists between each step; it may fix it for you, too.\n\nIf not, try switching to the settings in the last post above, that have changed between both .json files and repeat the steps.\n\nHopefully someone can piece together why first resetting and then re-importing my newer .json file fixed this weirdness.\nIf just saving, resetting, re-importing fixes others' playlists, we can rule out the change in settings between backups at least." ],

Important Guidelines\n\n- **Max 15 exercises per PR:**  \n  To avoid large PRs, limit the number of exercises being updated in each PR to a maximum of 15 exercises (less is ok too). \n  \n- **Do not close this issue via PRs:**  \n  Avoid referencing this issue in your PR with terms like `Fixes #XXX` or `Resolves #XXX`, since this would automatically close the issue. \n\n- **Avoid reimplemented exercises:**  \n  Make sure you are not copying descriptions from tests that have been reimplemented.\n\n- **Need help?**  \n  If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the comments!\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDCCB Checklist of Practice Exercises\n\n- [ ] acronym\n- [ ] affine-cipher\n- [ ] all-your-base\n- [ ] allergies\n- [ ] alphametics\n- [ ] anagram\n- [ ] armstrong-numbers\n- [ ] atbash-cipher\n- [ ] bank-account\n- [ ] binary-search-tree\n- [ ] binary-search\n- [ ] bob\n- [ ] book-store\n- [ ] bottle-song\n- [ ] bowling\n- [ ] change\n- [ ] circular-2buffer\n- [ ] clock\n- [ ] collatz-conjecture\n- [ ] complex-numbers\n- [ ] connect\n- [ ] crypto-square\n- [ ] custom-set\n- [ ] darts\n- [ ] diamond\n- [ ] difference-of-squares\n- [ ] dnd-character\n- [ ] dominoes\n- [ ] dot-dsl\n- [ ] eliuds-eggs\n- [ ] error-handling\n- [ ] etl\n- [ ] flatten-array\n- [ ] flower-field\n- [ ] food-chain\n- [ ] forth\n- [ ] game-of-life\n- [ ] gigasecond\n- [ ] go-counting\n- [ ] grade-school\n- [ ] grains\n- [ ] grep\n- [ ] hamming\n- [ ] hangman\n- [ ] hello-world\n- [ ] high-scores\n- [ ] house\n- [ ] isbn-verifier\n- [ ] isogram\n- [ ] killer-sudoku-helper\n- [ ] kindergarten-garden\n- [ ] knapsack\n- [ ] largest-series-product\n- [ ] leap\n- [ ] ledger\n- [ ] linked-list\n- [ ] list-ops\n- [ ] luhn\n- [ ] markdown\n- [ ] matching-brackets\n- [ ] matrix\n- [ ] mazy-mice\n- [ ] meetup\n- [ ] micro-blog\n- [ ] nth-prime\n- [ ] nucleotide-count\n- [ ] ocr-numbers\n- [ ] palindrome-products\n- [ ] pangram\n- [ ] parallel-letter-frequency\n- [ ] pascals-triangle\n- [ ] perfect-numbers\n- [ ] phone-number\n- [ ] piecing-it-together\n- [ ] pig-latin\n- [ ] poker\n- [ ] pov\n- [ ] prime-factors\n- [ ] protein-translation\n- [ ] proverb\n- [ ] pythagorean-triplet\n- [ ] queen-attack\n- [ ] rail-fence-cipher\n- [ ] raindrops\n- [ ] rational-numbers\n- [ ] react\n- [ ] rectangles\n- [ ] relative-distance\n- [ ] resistor-color-duo\n- [ ] resistor-color-trio\n- [ ] resistor-color\n- [ ] rest-api\n- [ ] reverse-string\n- [ ] rna-transcription\n- [ ] robot-name\n- [ ] robot-simulator\n- [ ] roman-numerals\n- [ ] rotational-cipher\n- [ ] run-length-encoding\n- [ ] saddle-points\n- [ ] satellite\n- [ ] say\n- [ ] scrabble-score\n- [ ] secret-handshake\n- [ ] series\n- [ ] sgf-parsing\n- [ ] sieve\n- [ ] simple-cipher\n- [ ] simple-linked-list\n- [ ] space-age\n- [ ] spiral-matrix\n- [ ] square-root\n- [ ] state-of-tic-tac-toe\n- [ ] sublist\n- [ ] sum-of-multiples\n- [x] swift-scheduling\n- [ ] tournament\n- [ ] transpose\n- [ ] tree-building\n- [ ] triangle\n- [ ] twelve-days\n- [ ] two-bucket\n- [ ] two-fer\n- [ ] variable-length-quantity\n- [ ] word-count\n- [ ] word-search\n- [ ] wordy\n- [ ] yacht\n- [ ] zebra-puzzle\n- [ ] zipper\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDCA1 Reference Example\n\nTo understand how to properly add `@DisplayName` annotations based on `canonical-data.json`, you can refer to the test file in the [Swift Scheduling exercise](https://github.com/exercism/java/tree/main/exercises/practice/swift-scheduling/src/test/java).\n\nIt already includes correctly formatted `@DisplayName` entries matching the test case descriptions, making it a good template for how your test file should look after the changes.",

Additionally, deploying with Docker Compose currently requires either adding a new custom collector configuration or modifying the existing one.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like:**\n\nBeing able to use any `otlphttp` exporter, with minimal configuration required.\n\nFor Kubernetes deployments, it would be great to add a new configuration option in the Helm charts that allows users to easily configure the OTLP HTTP endpoint. For example:\n\n``helm install otel-demo charts/opentelemetry-demo --set otlp-backend=true --set opentelemetry-collector.config.exporters.otlpbackend.endpoint=\"my-endpoint\"``\n\nFor Docker Compose deployments, it would be helpful to allow overriding OTLP endpoints and headers through environment variables. Additionally, it would be useful to enable users to select which exporters to use. One potential solution could be utilizing [Docker Compose Profiles](https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/profiles/), enabling users to specify the desired profile with a command like:\n\n``PROFILE=byob make start``",

An OTLP exporter is typically more than just an endpoint. OTLP headers are often required (especially for any SaaS vendor). Right now, we have 3 different pipelines configured for each telemetry type (traces, logs, metrics). Should this work for all 3? What if it should just be limited to 1 or 2 pipelines, how would those be specified as well?\n\nThere is certainly a level of complexity involved in needing to specify all the existing exporters because it's an array list, and YAML merges on arrays are destructive. At that same time, I'm also uncertain that this can be configured with a couple of command-line options and make things simpler.", "Just to raise a discussion here.\n\nI've tried setting up the docker compose profiles and they looked great at first sight!\nWe would drop 4 files in favour of 1.\n\nBut when I took a closer look to the `minimal` deployment it actually has one less env var: `KAFKA_ADDR` is not expected on the `checkout` service.\nI've googled a bit but it doesn't seem to be possible to have different env vars for different profiles.\n\nWe would need to have an `.override` file, which would still be better, but not sure if that's what we expected.\n\nAny opinions?", "> But when I took a closer look to the minimal deployment it actually has one less env var: KAFKA_ADDR is not expected on the checkout service.\n\nCould it be an option having multiple `.env` files?

      "url" : "https://github.com/AOSSIE-Org/Devr.AI/issues/97",
      "repositoryName" : "AOSSIE-Org/Devr.AI",
      "description" : "### Is your feature request related to a problem?\n\n- [x] Yes, it is related to a problem\n\n### Describe the feature you'd like\n\n## \uD83C\uDF1F Feature Description\n\nThis feature re-envisions the **`FAQ Handler`** as a specialized tool that leverages web search to answer general, high-level questions about the organization. It is designed to be the go-to tool for users seeking to understand the organization's mission, projects, and operational model.\n\nIt will be triggered when users ask questions like:\n\n  * *\"What is this organization all about?\"*\n  * *\"How does this organization work?\"*\n  * *\"What projects do you have?\"*\n  * *\"What are the main goals of Devr.AI?\"*\n\n## \uD83D\uDD0D Problem Statement\n\nNewcomers and potential contributors often have foundational questions about the organization itself before they dive into specific projects. Answering these questions manually is repetitive and inefficient. While a static knowledge base could work, it risks becoming outdated. A dynamic approach is needed to provide accurate, current information based on the organization's official public presence.\n\n## \uD83C\uDFAF Expected Outcome\n\nThe `FAQ Handler` will act as an automated public-facing representative, providing instant and accurate information about the organization. The expected outcome is a system that can:\n\n  * **Receive a general query** about the organization.\n  * **Dynamically search the web**, focusing on the organization's official website, blog, and public repositories.\n  * **Synthesize the search results** into a concise, easy-to-understand answer.\n  * **Provide source links** to allow users to explore the topic further.\n\n## \uD83D\uDCF7 Screenshots and Design Ideas\n\nThe workflow will be managed by the `FAQ Handler` tool, which will essentially be a specialized and intelligent implementation of a web search node.\n\n1.  **Trigger**: A user asks a general question.\n      * *User*: \"What kind of projects does this organization work on?\"\n2.  **Input**: The user's query is passed to the `FAQ Handler`.\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"query\": \"What projects does this organization have?\"\n    }\n    ```\n3.  **Action - Intelligent Web Search**:\n      * The tool formulates targeted search queries. For the example above, it would generate queries like:\n          * `\"Devr.AI open source projects\"`\n          * `\"Devr.AI GitHub repositories\"`\n          * `\"About Devr.AI projects\"`\n      * It executes these queries using the **Web Search Tool**.\n4.  **Synthesis**:\n      * The tool receives the top search results (snippets and URLs).\n      * It feeds this context to the LLM (Gemini) with a prompt like: *\"Based on the following search results, answer the user's question: 'What projects does this organization have?'\"*\n5.  **Output**: The tool returns a structured response containing the synthesized answer and the sources used.\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"status\": \"success\",\n      \"answer\": \"Devr.AI primarily focuses on creating tools for developer relations (DevRel), including AI-powered assistants for community engagement, issue triage, and onboarding. You can explore our main projects on our official website and GitHub page.\",\n      \"sources\": [\n        { \"title\": \"Devr.AI - Official Website\", \"url\": \"https://devr.ai/projects\" },\n        { \"title\": \"Devr.AI on GitHub\", \"url\": \"https://github.com/AOSSIE-Org/Devr.AI\" }\n      ]\n    }\n    ```\n6.  **Final Action**: The DevRel Agent formats this into a helpful message and sends it to the user.\n\n## \uD83D\uDCCB Additional Context\n\nBy aligning the **`FAQ Handler`** with the **Web Search** tool, we ensure a \"single source of truth\": the organization's own website and public materials. This approach is highly scalable and low-maintenance.\n\nTo make this tool effective, the primary task is not to build a database of FAQs, but to ensure that the organization's **website is well-structured and contains clear, findable answers** to these common questions. The success of the `FAQ Handler` is directly tied to the quality of the organization's public-facing content.\n\n### Record\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\n- [ ] I want to work on implementing this feature",

I'll elaborate on my workflow soon.", " **FAQ Handler Implementation:**\n\nI???ve carefully read through the problem statement and I believe this is a high-impact addition to your project.\n\nHere's how I plan to break this down and implement it, step by step:\n\n_Step 1: Question Intent Detection_\n\n- Build a simple NLP classifier (or use keyword-based matching) to determine if the user???s query is a general organizational FAQ (e.g., \"What projects do you have?\" or \"How does Devr.AI work?\").\n\n- This helps trigger the specialized FAQ Handler only for relevant questions.\n\n_Step 2: Dynamic Web Search Tool_\n\n- Use a web search API like:\n\n1. [SerpAPI](https://serpapi.com/) (Google/Bing wrapper),\n2. or DuckDuckGo Search API (open/free).\n\n- Fetch top 3???5 results focused on official sources.\n\n _Step 3: AI-Powered Synthesis_\n\n- Feed the top search results (title, snippet, URL) into an LLM like OpenAI GPT or Gemini using a structured prompt.\n\n- Example prompt:\n\n\"Based on the following search results, answer this user question in a concise and helpful way: 'What projects does Devr.AI work on?'\"\n\n_Step 4: Generate Final Response_\n\n- Parse the LLM output to:\n\n1. Return a clear, user-friendly answer.\n2. Include a list of cited sources.\n\n_Step 5: Integration into the Main Bot or Frontend_\n\n- Package this as a backend endpoint or a callable tool inside your chatbot/workflow agent.\n\n- Ensure it fails gracefully (e.g., no results or poor connectivity ??? fallback message).\n\n**\uD83D\uDD27 Why Me?**\nAlthough I???m new to contributing, I???m genuinely passionate about AI, developer tools, and meaningful open source work. I'm confident I can break this down into clean, maintainable code and deliver something the community will benefit from.\n\nI???d love your feedback or go-ahead to get started!\n\n@smokeyScraper \n\n", "yes @PrithvijitBose, we require this tool to be aligned in a similar way; just with a few changes.\nFor step 1, instead of any keyboard based matching, let there be a thinking node which can align the user's query to well aligned question.\nFor step 2, we already have Tavily as well as DuckDuckGo configured.\nRest flow is correct and we just need to ensure minimal nodes and minimizing calls to the model.\n\n@Rudra775 did a bit of work on this issue too, I think you both can work on this issue together? I'll let you know more on the design details.", "@smokeyScraper sure man, will love to work with like minded people ", "@Rudra775 I am a newbie in Open Source.. but i know about the task..can you help me contribute to this project as well\n\nIt will be a great help for me", "@PrithvijitBose im not an expert either, just trying to learn from everywhere i can. lets connect on discord and discuss. `rudraaa_24`" ],

I think the desired documentation is different than [the docs page on how to publish to the App Store](https://briefcase.readthedocs.io/en/stable/how-to/publishing/iOS.html), since the goal is just to run on a device tied to the developer's Apple account.

Or should I just generate them myself from some already translated mdbook?~~\r\nI've generated some example files myself (with po4a) to work with.", "Hejsa! Thanks for looking at this!\r\n\r\nI was thinking to use some of the [Rust book translations](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-06-translation.html) to start with, e.g., pick one here which is somewhat current and which you can read :slightly_smiling_face: \r\n\r\nThe [Rust Embedded book](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/#translations) is also translated into a few languages ??? that's where the idea came from.\r\n\r\nYou might want be able to reuse some of the logic in [`mdbook-i18n-normalize`](https://github.com/google/mdbook-i18n-helpers/blob/main/src/bin/mdbook-i18n-normalize.rs). That tool takes a PO file looks at each `(msgid, msgstr)` pair. It then runs `extract_messages` on both to get two lists:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet msgids = [\"msgid_1\", \"msgid_2\", \"msgid_1\"];\r\nlet msgstrs = [\"msgstr_1\", \"msgstr_2\", \"msgstr_1\"];\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, it zips those lists and output the `(\"msgid_N\", \"msgstr_N\")` pairs to the PO file. Having written this, it occurs to me that this is what your tool will have to do as well.\r\n\r\nOne feature your tool could have would be to (attempt to) synchronize the translations on various points. So if the source text is\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n# The Foo Project\r\n\r\nWelcome to the Foo projects...\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\nTo install Foo, do ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nand the translated document is\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n# Foo-projektet\r\n\r\nVelkommen til Foo-projektet...\r\n\r\n## Komme godt igang\r\n\r\nFor at installere Foo, ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen the conversion tool could align on the `#` and `##` headings. This would make it robust against extra paragraphs being inserted in either language.\r\n\r\nSimilar with lists and block quotes, they could perhaps also be synchronization points. This is just an idea, I'm not sure it's useful :smile: \r\n", "> It would be a separate bin crate then?\r\n\r\nI missed this part, I think it could just be a new binary next to the others to start with. If people like the tool but somehow don't want to see `mdbook-*` binaries on their system, then we could consider moving this binary to its own crate. Luckily, mdbook-i18n-helpers is already a library crate, so it's easy to depend on it from other crates.", ">I think it could just be a new binary next to the others to start with.\r\n\r\nYes, that's what I mean by \"separate bin crate\". I agree that we might do a separate \"package\" later on if needed.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I'm a bit held up at the moment with other work, but I'll keep working in this whenever I have the time.\r\n\r\n>I was thinking to use some of the [Rust book translations](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-06-translation.html) to start with\r\n\r\nFrom that link, how do I get the actual translated .md file?

I'm from Denmark and I guess you're from Sweden), leads me to https://github.com/sebras/book/tree/master/src where I see a bunch of translated files. So I would use these two files an a starting point:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/sebras/book/blob/master/src/ch00-00-introduction.md\r\n- https://github.com/rust-lang/book/blob/main/src/ch00-00-introduction.md\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if the idea actually works... will 10% of the paragraphs line up, or 80%? Just from skimming those two files, it looks like a lot of text lines up very nicely.", "Hejsan!\r\n\r\nI've (finally) started looking into this. The code required is pretty straight forward for reading, parsing and extracting. The hard part is the syncing. Having looked at a couple different translations of the book, they can differ a lot, a little, or not at all.\r\n\r\nSome examples.\r\nFilename: number-of-extracted-messages\r\n\r\nch00-00-introduction.en.md: 45\r\nch00-00-introduction.sv.md: 46\r\n\r\nch01-02-hello-world.en.md: 45\r\nch01-02-hello-world.sv.md: 42\r\n\r\nch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.en.md: 177\r\nch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.pt.md: 252\r\n\r\nTrying to line them up might work in really simple scenarios, where the structure is still intact. But in the PT case above, the EN version is really far ahead. The main problem I see is that there is a lack of context in the MD files. If a single heading (or other sync point of choice) is left out in either file, the remaining message pairs will be garbage. Even with a small difference like 42 vs 45, there is no way to tell if the diff was at message 1 or 40.\r\n\r\nSo what is \"good enough\" here? Should we fail as soon as something appears to be off? Or greedily try to do what we can? What's the threshold? Strict or lax? Need some guidance here.", "Btw, having run just my own tool (which calls `extract_messages()`) a number of times, closing down my editor and my terminal, I get a number of zoombie processes that linger consuming CPU.\r\n(I only noticed this because this is the first time ever the fan on my M3 has started.)\r\nIs this expected?\r\n\r\n<img width=\"618\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/google/mdbook-i18n-helpers/assets/318504/1fdaf003-02ed-4750-85bc-78295ab0e4e1\">\r\n\r\n\r\n", "> Trying to line them up might work in really simple scenarios, where the structure is still intact. But in the PT case above, the EN version is really far ahead.\r\n\r\nThat is a very good point and I don't think there is a clear right answer here.\r\n\r\nOur `mdbook-i18n-normalize` tool has a similar problem: it normalizes a `.po` file by re-applying the extraction logic. The idea is that we've improved the way we extract messages over time and so this tool lets you migrate an old `xx.po` file to benefit from the latest improvements. Biggest example of this: we used to extract a Markdown table as a single unit, now we extract the text cell by cell.\r\n\r\nWhen we normalize each `(msgid, msgstr)` pair, we run into similar problems as what you have here: we could easily end up with different number of extracted messages from each of `msgid` and `msgstr`. The normalization tool handles this in a very primitive way here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/google/mdbook-i18n-helpers/blob/2b14491962254ec2ff3f12ffeb59f09f7f4686ae/i18n-helpers/src/normalize.rs#L203-L220\r\n\r\nIf there are extra messages in the `msgstr` field, it accumulates them in the final `msgid` field. This is confusing in its own way and indirectly lead to #125.\r\n\r\n> The main problem I see is that there is a lack of context in the MD files. If a single heading (or other sync point of choice) is left out in either file, the remaining message pairs will be garbage. Even with a small difference like 42 vs 45, there is no way to tell if the diff was at message 1 or 40.\r\n\r\nYou mention a \"sync point\"... which is something we haven't looked into before! For the use case of generating a `.po` file from two `.md` files, I think establishing some sync points could be very helpful. This could be Markdown features which we hope are stable over time:\r\n\r\n- headings of different levels\r\n- lists\r\n- tables\r\n- block quote\r\n\r\nand perhaps others?\r\n\r\nI haven't thought this through, but I could imagine using a [largest common subsequence or diffing algorithm](https://florian.github.io/diffing/) to find common parts of the Markdown AST between the two documents.\r\n\r\nThe flow would be something like this:\r\n\r\n1. Extract the AST for each document\r\n2. Normalize all text so that you're left with a normalized outline. Something like\r\n\r\n   ```markdown\r\n\r\n   # Heading 1\r\n   ## Heading 1.1\r\n\r\n   Paragraph 1 in 1.1\r\n\r\n   Paragraph 2 in 1.1\r\n\r\n   - Item 1 in 1.1\r\n   - Item 2 in 1.1\r\n\r\n   Paragraph 3 in 1.1\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   Here I'm thinking that it'll be good to include the heading numbers in the normalized paragraph and list item text to give the diffing algorithm something to \"attach to\"?\r\n\r\n3. Diff the two normalized documents. Everything that matches gives you a mapping from `msgid` (from the first document) to `msgstr` (the second document). Things that are extra in the second document can be dropped, things that are missing in the second document just have a `msgstr` equal to `\"\"`\r\n4. Go back from the normalized outlines to the original documents and output a `.po` file.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, one document will be the source. So regardless of what the translated document contains, the source will win: if there are 10 paragraphs in the source document, then there should also be 10 paragraphs in the translation. This is kind of a built in limitation of the way we attempt to chop up the source document when we do translations.", "> Btw, having run just my own tool (which calls `extract_messages()`) a number of times, closing down my editor and my terminal, I get a number of zoombie processes that linger consuming CPU.\r\n> (I only noticed this because this is the first time ever the fan on my M3 has started.)\r\n> Is this expected?\r\n\r\nNope, I would not expect this ??? everything in this library should be completely in-process and not spawn anything. It only does text to text transformations.\r\n\r\nThe `group_events-...` name is interesting: we don't have a binary with that name, so I guess it comes from somewhere else?", "Hi @memark, let me unassign this for now ??? we can assign it back to you or someone else later when activity picks up.", "> I haven't thought this through, but I could imagine using a [largest common subsequence or diffing algorithm](https://florian.github.io/diffing/) to find common parts of the Markdown AST between the two documents.\n\n## Overall idea\nWhen thinking about this I also think this is best done by matching on the AST.\nLets parse the markdown with pulldown_cmark and use the [`Event`](https://docs.rs/pulldown-cmark/latest/pulldown_cmark/enum.Event.html)s as symbols without the content. E.g. `Text(\"foobar\")` just becomes `Text`, `Start(Tag)` and `End(TagEnd)` have important structural information in [`Tag`](https://docs.rs/pulldown-cmark/latest/pulldown_cmark/enum.Tag.html) and [`TagEnd`](https://docs.rs/pulldown-cmark/latest/pulldown_cmark/enum.TagEnd.html) and are kept. All elements that are structural informations are kept.\n\nThe sequence should still store enough information in such a way that we can recover the original document.\n\nNow we want to get the best matching between the two structural sequences.\n\n## Algorithms\nLet's compare some algorithms. Bioinformatics has to deal a lot with sequence matching, so this is a good inspiration \n- [Longest Common Subsequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence) (LCS): Finds the longest common subsequence that appears in the same order in both sequences. This would provide us with all elements that are actually equal and makes it easy to dismiss the \"extra\" bits. As far as I understand, it only matches unmodified bits of structure. If someone changes an element to a different type this will be missed.\n- [Needleman-Wunsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needleman%E2%80%93Wunsch_algorithm): Performs global alignment over the entire length to find the best overall match. This is usually used if two sequences are similar and of roughly equal size. This would just match up the structure as good as possible and could deal with the issue of translators changing the structure to a different type.\n- [Smit-Waterman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith%E2%80%93Waterman_algorithm): Performs local alignment that identifies regions of high similarity within the sequences. Usually this is used for dissimilar sequences that are suspected to contain regions of similarity. Not the best fit for our use case.\n\nLet's think about this for a minute:\n\nThe Longest Common Subsequence can exactly provide what we need. It would try to match the structure and all structures that match are returned and this has with high probability (but not 1.0) matching content that was translated. It discards every changed structural element (`[A B C]` ??? `[A D C]`) but would keep the `[A C]` elements. In reality a lot of algorithms provide a vector of changes so we could also see these inserts, deletions.\n\nThe last two could also be candidates for the problem we face. From these I would propose the global [alignment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_alignment#Global_and_local_alignments) as by definition, the second document is a document that was once the exact same structure but differed (ideally) only by the non-structural text that is invisible to the algorithm. This would allow to try to match (`[A B C]` ??? `[A D C]`) in a way that it recognized that `B` was *edited* into `D`. Which might be wrong but could be true.\n\nI don't think it really matters for our usecase if we use a LCS or a Needleman-Wunsch and they both should provide similar output. The later just seems to be a bit more flexible in the sequence comparison.\n\n## Crates:\n### Longest common Subsequence\n[crates](https://crates.io/search?q=longest%20common%20subsequence)\n- [lcs_rs](https://crates.io/crates/lcs_rs) (v0.1.1): API requires strings, does not return changes\n- [slice-diff-patch](https://crates.io/crates/slice-diff-patch) (v1.2.4): works with parametrized vectors of elements (supporting `PartialEq`. [provides change vector](https://docs.rs/slice-diff-patch/1.2.4/slice_diff_patch/) (insert, remove, update,...). Looks very promising\n- [diffs](https://crates.io/crates/diffs) (v0.5.1): This supports a Binary, a Meyers (used for git) and a Patience (git also supports this, more human readable diff). This might be usable but the documentation is pretty slim, has [tests as examples](https://nest.pijul.com/pijul/diffs:main/XNQ4AFHIXFKIQ.CEAAA) and might support our use case.\n\n\n### Needleman-Wunsch\n[crates](https://crates.io/search?q=needleman-wunsch):\n- [stringzilla](https://crates.io/crates/stringzilla) (v3.12.5): heavily optimized string matching crate, leveraging SIMD. using [`[u8]` in the API](https://docs.rs/stringzilla/3.12.5/stringzilla/sz/fn.alignment_score.html). While this might be usable if our structural elements are translated to numbers, I don't see how I can get the alignment operations as a result.\n- [needleman](https://crates.io/crates/needleman) (v0.2.0): API expects two strings and I don't see how I can get the alignment as result.\n- [seal](https://crates.io/crates/seal) (v0.1.5, last release 3 years ago...): This is a generic API that just needs a (equality) compare function between elements of both sequences. And it supports both local and global alignment, even if I don't think local would give as any advantage but this is easily testable.\n\n### What crate will I use?\nI will pick the LCS supporting crate [slice-diff-patch](https://crates.io/crates/slice-diff-patch) (v1.2.4) because the API supports parameterized vector elements, it provides a change vector and there was a recently release.\n\nMy next favorite option would have been [seal](https://crates.io/crates/seal) (v0.1.5) which supports Needleman-Wunsch and also supports parameterized vector elements, provides a change vector. But its last release is 3 years ago and has a low version number, indicating not much support.\n\n\n## Challenges:\nThe problem gets difficult once there are extra regions because we don't know which `B` of the sequence `ABBA`, `ABBBA` was introduced newly. We could try to provide some additional hints for that case by using the text length of this structure as an additional property. `A(_) B(20) B(10) A(_)` and `A(_) B(23) B(50) B(8) A(_)` would lead to the conclusion that B(50) was added in the second structure.\n\n## Ideas for encoding the structure to deal with structural changes:\n- Structural Elements are encoded into Enum Variants and we dive as deep as necessary into the elements and keep all structural information\n- Text is encoded by substituting each word with a new Enum Variant `Word` (or `Letter`, `Sentence`) under the assumption that translations use roughly the same amount of words but different amount of letters per word (and differently ordered). Some testing / benchmarking might provide us with data. The existing po files are the perfect source for generating data if `Letter`, `Word` (split by whitespace) or even rougher as `Sentence` (split by dot - or more generic non-whitespace separators) are better (because each sentence might be translated to exactly once sentence, providing perfect matching opportunities). Paragraphs are already encoded in the [Tag](https://docs.rs/pulldown-cmark/latest/pulldown_cmark/enum.Tag.html) but might otherwise also be an opportunity.", "The above comment describes how the markdown structures could be matched up. Assuming for now this work properly, we would still need to create the po file.\n\nProblem: `mdbook_i18n_helpers::extract_messages()` is extracting messages but not storing any structure.\n\nHow to proceed from here? Match up both docs and create an intermediate doc.\n# Run LCS\nRun the LCS algorithm for both documents and build understanding on the equal, updated (in a structural sense), removed or added elements.\n## Note\nBe aware that there is very likely no perfect match if the content length (letters, words, sentences) is somehow taken into account in the structure. Running the LCS with the text length as a guiding information is nice but this information should probably not be taken into account in the next steps.\n\n# How to use the result\n## Create aligned version of both documents\nWe need to create intermediate aligned versions of both documents for the next steps\n### Inner Join or Perfect match\nCreate a perfectly matched version of both documents. Keep only the perfect **matching** elements and disregard everything that was **added**, **removed**, **updated**. This could be used for the first po version.\nThe translated documents can then already be generated but would likely miss some things.\nThis is OK thought as then the original document can be parsed again with the usual process and new text can be added as usual.\n\n### Alternative: Left Join\nCreate a \"Left Join\" version of the matched up original and translated docs. Keep everything that is **equal** or where something in the translation was **removed**. This requires marking the translation as unavailable. Elements **added** or **updated** (structural) in the translation are not used.\nThis would generate a version that already contains all input from the original source but disregards additions / modifications in the translated doc.\n#### Idea for future\nKeep updated elements as well if a special CLI parameter is set. It is a bit unclear how to proceed with **updated** elements as this could be either a translator modifying the structure (change list to paragraph etc.) or it was a combination of remove from original + adding in translated doc. Likely not very useful but depending on how translators worked in the past this could be an option. This needs to be flagged for the user to have a special look at. \n\n## Create translation.\nOnce the structure is aligned, it should be easy to run `mdbook_i18n_helpers::extract_messages()` for both aligned documents, zip the messages into an catalog and create a po file from that.", "I quickly tested the matching approach and with the `lcs_diff` I can properly match up the [german translation](https://rust-lang-de.github.io/rustbook-de/ch00-00-introduction.html) of the [introduction](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch00-00-introduction.html) of the rust lang book.\n\nI used this page as test because it is long and has the challenge of a Note section in the beginning. This can be properly detected. But there is some merging of remove + insert operations into an update operation that is not working properly for code + softbreak situations. These happen when there is a code block at the end of a line followed by a softbreak.\n\nA solution would be to override this behavior or even better use the underlying function [lcs_diff::diff()](https://docs.rs/lcs-diff/latest/lcs_diff/fn.diff.html) directly. The patch function that is offered by the [slice-diff-patch](https://crates.io/crates/slice-diff-patch) crate is not worth the additional trouble.\n\nI need to clean my draft code up a bit, add the extract messages part and create the final catalog", "Note: LCS seems to work well with specific cases but overall a Needleman-Wunsch algorithm might produce better results.\n\ne.g. in the case:\n- Heading, Text(A, 10 Sentences), Text(B, 20 Sentences), Text(C, 30 Sentences)\n- Heading, Text(B, 20 Sentences), Text(C, 30 Sentences)\n\nThis might produce a matching of A->B (with additions) and B->C (with additions) and C -> not yet translated", "It turns out it is difficult to work with cmark event streams. While this is not entirely bad, there is still a lot of tuning necessary.\n\nAnother thought might be to use AI for this (oh no, he said AI! ;) ). Not in a \"just give it two markdown files and create the po\" prompt style but actually compare embeddings of (parts) of the original and translation. Then the similar embeddings should point us to the right pairs of translated paragraphs" ],

If not already implemented, hashing submissions and checking against existing github url would be straightforward and inexpensive to prevent duplicates upfront.\n\nThe \"suggest libraries you think should be deleted\" approach is a perfect example of the popularity contest issue - manual curation risks favoring established libraries over promising newcomers.

      "description" : "### Feature request\n\nWe want Dynamo to offer and support robust, disaggregated serving for a wide range of multimodal models-including vision-language models (VLMs), audio models, and multi-image inference. To do so, we need to broaden EPDD???s support to cover more models and data types. \n\nIn addition to the currently supported models, we should support all state-of-the-art multimodal models for disaggregated serving -- and not just for vision/image but also audio and video. [This MR](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/pull/1388) did a lot of work generalizing the existing multimodal example to work for more models, but there is still more to do with respect to testing additional models and iterating on that work if needed. Ideally, adding support for a new model should be as easy as changing a few fields in the config:\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ad75707-df05-434e-872d-c463e3fcc239\n\n### Describe the problem you're encountering\n\nWe're currently only confirmed to support LLaVA 1.5, Qwen2-VL, Qwen2.5-VL, and Phi3V/Phi3.5V with aggregated serving, and LLaVA for disaggregated serving.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've tried\n\n_No response_",

Block a domain (e.g., mastodon.social)\n2. View an account on that domain (e.g., search for an account known to be on that domain)\n3. Open the account details page\n4. See Follow button is enabled\n5. Click button, get 403 error\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nButton is shown disabled. Possibly, clicking on it shows a toast with a \"You cannot follow this account, you have blocked $domain\" message. Possibly with a button to remove the domain block.\n\n**Versions**\n\n2.14.0\n",

The user expected these options to be grayed out to clearly indicate they are inactive when the main auto-approve feature is disabled, providing better visual feedback about which settings are actually in effect.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Open the Cline auto-approve settings (above the text prompt input)\n2. Uncheck \"Enable auto-approve\" (if it's currently checked)\n3. Observe that all other auto-approval options (Toggle all, Read project files, Read all files, Edit project files, Execute safe commands, Use the browser, Use MCP servers) remain visually enabled and appear clickable\n\n### Relevant API REQUEST output\n\n```shell\nN/A\n```\n\n### Provider/Model\n\nanthropic / claude-sonnet-4-20250514\n\n### Operating System\n\nlinux 6.11.0-25-generic\n\n### System Info\n\nVSCode: 1.100.2, Node.js: v20.19.0, Architecture: x64\n\n### Cline Version\n\n3.17.0\n\n### Additional context\n\nThis is a UX improvement suggestion to make the interface more intuitive. When the main \"Enable auto-approve\" option is disabled, users would benefit from visual feedback showing that the sub-options are not active. The developer team can decide whether the grayed-out options should remain clickable (allowing users to pre-configure settings) or be completely disabled.\n\n[Created/submitted by AI: Cline v3, Claude Sonnet 4]",

After analyzing the codebase, the `are_site_fields_synced` method appears to be unused in production code and is only referenced in test files. Additionally, the `fetch_site_fields` method is only used internally by the unused `are_site_fields_synced` method, making it a candidate for removal as well.\n\nThis cleanup will streamline the Google_Proxy class by removing dead code that is no longer needed, reducing the maintenance burden and potential confusion for developers working with the authentication system.\n\n---------------\n\n_Do not alter or remove anything below. The following sections will be managed by moderators only._\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n\n* The `are_site_fields_synced` method is removed from the Google_Proxy class in `includes/Core/Authentication/Google_Proxy.php:384-398`\n* The `fetch_site_fields` method is removed from the Google_Proxy class in `includes/Core/Authentication/Google_Proxy.php:371-373` (since it's only used by the removed method)\n* All related test files are updated to remove references to these methods\n* No production code functionality is affected by these removals\n* Code documentation is updated if necessary\n\n## Implementation Brief\n\n* [ ] Remove the `are_site_fields_synced` method from the Google_Proxy class ([lines 384-398](https://github.com/google/site-kit-wp/blob/ac30b01bcedabc17e77ba957a2dbc4ccea5433ed/includes/Core/Authentication/Google_Proxy.php#L384-L398))\n* [ ] Remove the `fetch_site_fields` method from the Google_Proxy class ([lines 371-373](https://github.com/google/site-kit-wp/blob/ac30b01bcedabc17e77ba957a2dbc4ccea5433ed/includes/Core/Authentication/Google_Proxy.php#L371-L373)) since it's only used by the method being removed\n* [ ] Verify that all authentication flows continue to work properly after removal\n\n### Test Coverage\n\n* [ ] Remove the `test_fetch_site_fields` test method from Google_ProxyTest ([lines 154-190](https://github.com/google/site-kit-wp/blob/ac30b01bcedabc17e77ba957a2dbc4ccea5433ed/tests/phpunit/integration/Core/Authentication/Google_ProxyTest.php#L154-L190))\n* [ ] Remove the `test_are_site_fields_synced` test method from Google_ProxyTest ([lines 192-220](https://github.com/google/site-kit-wp/blob/ac30b01bcedabc17e77ba957a2dbc4ccea5433ed/tests/phpunit/integration/Core/Authentication/Google_ProxyTest.php#L192-L220))\n* [ ] Run full test suite to ensure no unexpected dependencies exist\n\n## QA Brief\n\n* Verify that users can still authenticate with Google services without issues\n* Test site setup and registration flows to ensure they work correctly\n* Confirm that existing authenticated sites continue to function properly\n* Test permissions and setup URLs generation to ensure no regression\n\n## Changelog entry\n\n* Remove unused `are_site_fields_synced` and `fetch_site_fields` methods from Google_Proxy class to reduce technical debt.",

Then during simulations due to numerical reasons said concentration can become negative for short periods of time.

If the issue you raised is not a bug but a question, please raise a discussion at https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/discussions/new/choose Otherwise, it will be closed.\n- [ ] 5. Please use English, otherwise it will be closed.\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nThe GPU memory usage when serving Kimi VL is too high.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n1. First monitor GPU memory usage using `nvitop`\n2. Launch server with `python -m sglang.launch_server --model-path moonshotai/Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 --trust-remote-code --reasoning-parser kimi --mem-fraction-static 0.5`\nThe usage should be around 50%.\n3. Run `python benchmark/mmmu/bench_sglang.py --port 30000 --concurrency 8` in sglang.\n4. Continue monitoring the memory usage, it would up to 98%, and sometimes cause OOM\n\n### Environment\n\nPython: 3.10.12 (main, May 27 2025, 17:12:29) [GCC 11.4.0]\nCUDA available: True\nGPU 0,1,2,3: NVIDIA H100 80GB HBM3\nGPU 0,1,2,3 Compute Capability: 9.0\nCUDA_HOME: /usr/local/cuda\nNVCC: Cuda compilation tools, release 12.4, V12.4.131\nCUDA Driver Version: 550.127.05\nPyTorch: 2.7.1+cu126\nsglang: 0.4.7.post1\nsgl_kernel: 0.1.9\nflashinfer_python: 0.2.6.post1\ntriton: 3.3.1\ntransformers: 4.52.3\ntorchao: 0.9.0\nnumpy: 2.2.5\naiohttp: 3.11.18\nfastapi: 0.115.12\nhf_transfer: 0.1.9\nhuggingface_hub: 0.30.2\ninteregular: 0.3.3\nmodelscope: 1.25.0\norjson: 3.10.16\noutlines: 0.1.11\npackaging: 25.0\npsutil: 7.0.0\npydantic: 2.11.3\npython-multipart: 0.0.20\npyzmq: 26.4.0\nuvicorn: 0.34.2\nuvloop: 0.21.0\nvllm: Module Not Found\nxgrammar: 0.1.19\nopenai: 1.76.0\ntiktoken: 0.9.0\nanthropic: 0.50.0\nlitellm: 1.67.4.post1\ndecord: 0.6.0\nNVIDIA Topology: \n        GPU0    GPU1    GPU2    GPU3    GPU4    GPU5    GPU6    GPU7      CPU Affinity    NUMA Affinity   GPU NUMA ID\nGPU0     X      NV18    NV18    NV18    NV18    NV18    NV18    NV18      0-47,96-143     0               N/A\nGPU1    NV18     X      NV18    NV18    NV18    NV18    NV18    NV18      0-47,96-143     0               N/A\nGPU2    NV18    NV18     X      NV18    NV18    NV18    NV18    NV18      0-47,96-143     0               N/A\nGPU3    NV18    NV18    NV18     X      NV18    NV18    NV18    NV18      0-47,96-143     0               N/A\nGPU4    NV18    NV18    NV18    NV18     X      NV18    NV18    NV18      48-95,144-191   1               N/A\nGPU5    NV18    NV18    NV18    NV18    NV18     X      NV18    NV18      48-95,144-191   1               N/A\nGPU6    NV18    NV18    NV18    NV18    NV18    NV18     X      NV18      48-95,144-191   1               N/A\nGPU7    NV18    NV18    NV18    NV18    NV18    NV18    NV18     X        48-95,144-191   1               N/A\n\nLegend:\n\n  X    = Self\n  SYS  = Connection traversing PCIe as well as the SMP interconnect between NUMA nodes (e.g., QPI/UPI)\n  NODE = Connection traversing PCIe as well as the interconnect between PCIe Host Bridges within a NUMA node\n  PHB  = Connection traversing PCIe as well as a PCIe Host Bridge (typically the CPU)\n  PXB  = Connection traversing multiple PCIe bridges (without traversing the PCIe Host Bridge)\n  PIX  = Connection traversing at most a single PCIe bridge\n  NV#  = Connection traversing a bonded set of # NVLinks\n\nHypervisor vendor: KVM\nulimit soft: 1048576",

I think the reason is sdpa requires a large space for activation.\n\nThanks! But I think other models also use spda for vision attention, but the behaviour is only observed by kimi vl. May you have a deeper investigation? btw, all the best with your internship :)", "# Reason\nI spent some time today and I guess I found the answer. In other MLLM models for example, qwen2.5 VL, they use the sdpa attention in vision.py where the q k v's shapes have length four `[batch_size, seq_len, num_heads, head_dim]` while in kimi_vl their shapes have length three `[seq_len, num_heads, head_dim]` and this leads to huge memory consumption difference. \n\nI vefified this with this change. I changed the code calling the attention in both `vision.py` and `kimi_vl_moonvit.py` from \n```python\n    attn_output = F.scaled_dot_product_attention(q, k, v, attention_mask, dropout_p=0.0)\n```\nto\n```python\n            print(q.shape, k.shape, v.shape, attention_mask.shape)\n            torch.cuda.empty_cache()\n            torch.cuda.reset_peak_memory_stats()\n            torch.cuda.synchronize()\n            before = torch.cuda.memory_allocated()\n            output = F.scaled_dot_product_attention(\n                q,\n                k,\n                v,\n                attn_mask=attention_mask,\n                dropout_p=self.dropout,\n                is_causal=False,\n            )\n            torch.cuda.synchronize()\n            after = torch.cuda.memory_allocated()\n            peak = torch.cuda.max_memory_allocated()\n\n            intermediate = peak - max(before, after)\n            print(f\"Intermediate peak memory: {intermediate / 1024 / 1024:.2f} MB\")\n```\nto get the peak memory consumption.\nFor the same request whose id is `validation_Psychology_16` I got this result from kimi VL:\n```\ntorch.Size([16, 5848, 72]) torch.Size([16, 5848, 72]) torch.Size([16, 5848, 72]) torch.Size([1, 5848, 5848])\nIntermediate peak memory: 4855.24 MB\n```\nand this result from qwen2.5 VL:\n```\ntorch.Size([1, 16, 5676, 80]) torch.Size([1, 16, 5676, 80]) torch.Size([1, 16, 5676, 80]) torch.Size([1, 5676, 5676])\nIntermediate peak memory: 109.86 MB\n```\nOnce I add\n```python\nq.unsqueeze(0)\nk.unsqueeze(0)\nv.unsqueeze(0)\n```\nto kimi VL, the memory consumption drops to `66.00 MB`\n\n**I guess this can be bug for torch. WDYT?**\n\n# Fix\n**One quick fix** could be add the unsqueeze to qkv and squeeze to attn_output in kimi VL. The problem is numeric stability. I wrote the very simple following script to test the memory consumption and numeric difference:\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    q = torch.randn(16, 5848, 72, device=\"cuda\", dtype=torch.bfloat16)\n    k = torch.randn(16, 5848, 72, device=\"cuda\", dtype=torch.bfloat16)\n    v = torch.randn(16, 5848, 72, device=\"cuda\", dtype=torch.bfloat16)\n    q_cu_seqlens = torch.tensor([0, 5848], device=\"cuda\", dtype=torch.int32)\n    seq_length = 5848\n    attention_mask = torch.zeros(\n        [1, seq_length, seq_length], device=q.device, dtype=torch.bool\n    )\n    for i in range(1, len(q_cu_seqlens)):\n        attention_mask[\n            ...,\n            q_cu_seqlens[i - 1] : q_cu_seqlens[i],\n            q_cu_seqlens[i - 1] : q_cu_seqlens[i],\n        ] = True\n\n    # Get the result and peak memory size \n    torch.cuda.empty_cache()\n    torch.cuda.reset_peak_memory_stats()\n    torch.cuda.synchronize()\n    before = torch.cuda.memory_allocated()\n    attn_output = F.scaled_dot_product_attention(q, k, v, attention_mask, dropout_p=0.0)\n    torch.cuda.synchronize()\n    after = torch.cuda.memory_allocated()\n    peak = torch.cuda.max_memory_allocated()\n    intermediate = peak - max(before, after)\n    print(f\"Intermediate peak memory: {intermediate / 1024 / 1024:.2f} MB\")\n\n    # Get the result and peak memory size when q, k, v are unsqueezed\n    torch.cuda.empty_cache()\n    torch.cuda.reset_peak_memory_stats()\n    torch.cuda.synchronize()\n    before = torch.cuda.memory_allocated()\n    q = q.unsqueeze(0)\n    k = k.unsqueeze(0)\n    v = v.unsqueeze(0)\n    attn_output_unsqueeze = F.scaled_dot_product_attention(q, k, v, attention_mask, dropout_p=0.0)\n    torch.cuda.synchronize()\n    after = torch.cuda.memory_allocated()\n    peak = torch.cuda.max_memory_allocated()\n    intermediate = peak - max(before, after)\n    print(f\"Intermediate peak memory with unsqueeze: {intermediate / 1024 / 1024:.2f} MB\")\n    attn_output_unsqueeze = attn_output_unsqueeze.squeeze(0)\n\n    # Compare the largest diff between the two outputs\n    diff = torch.abs(attn_output - attn_output_unsqueeze)\n    max_diff = torch.max(diff)\n    print(f\"Max difference between outputs: {max_diff.item()}\")\n     \n```\nThe numeric diff can be up to 0.001:\n```bash\nIntermediate peak memory: 4855.24 MB\nIntermediate peak memory with unsqueeze: 65.23 MB\nMax difference between outputs: 0.0009765625\n```\nIs a numeric error of 0.001 acceptable?\n\n**The second fix** possible is to convert kimi VL to use the sdpa attention defined in `vision.py` which does not seem to be too different at first look\n\n**The third fix** is possible to raise an issue in PyTorch and fix the memory consumption there.\n\nWDYT?", "@PanJason Great! Unsqueeze itself can already be considered a decent plan, you just to need to compare the accuracy before & after.\nBut I'm more concerned about the fact that even though dims are not in the expected way, the tests still passed. Can you figure out a way preventing this issue from happening?", "Hi I compared the accuracy before and after for **one layer** which can be 0.001 and such diff can be aggregated across layers. Is that acceptable?", "> Hi I compared the accuracy before and after for **one layer** which can be 0.001 and such diff can be aggregated across layers. Is that acceptable?\n\nSounds ok, but we should rely on image benchmarks, e.g. mmmu and more from `lmms_eval`", "Thanks I will check later this week." ],

Place your answers and information on the blank line below each question.\n-->\n\n### Steps to reproduce:\n1/ Set keepalive in audio settings to any number, i.e. 30.\n2. Cause NVDA to speak then wait for the keepalive timeout.\n### Actual behavior:\n<!--\nUse \"Speak command keys\" (NVDA+4) and speech viewer to copy and paste here.\nUse braille viewer to copy and paste here.\nYou may additionally include an explanation.\n-->\nOn some headphones, specifically the Sony XM6, and the Turtle Beach Stealth 700 gen 3, the keepalive will only work for approximately 6 seconds.After this time, the headphones will stop emitting sound completely and any new speech will be cut off.\n### Expected behavior:\n<!--\nUse \"Speak command keys\" (NVDA+4) and speech viewer to copy and paste here.\nUse braille viewer to copy and paste here.\nYou may additionally include an explanation.\n-->\nAudio will be kept alive as requested by the keepalive setting.\nThis can be fixed by using the debug parameter `config.conf[\"audio\"][\"whiteNoiseVolume\"] = 1`.\nThis setting should be exposed in the audio settings and documented in the user guide\n### NVDA logs, crash dumps and other attachments:\n\n### System configuration\n#### NVDA installed/portable/running from source:\nInstalled.\n#### NVDA version:\nVersion: 2025.1.2 (2025.1.2.36913)\n#### Windows version:\nWindows 11 Home Version 2024 H2\n#### Name and version of other software in use when reproducing the issue:\nNone. Happens with all software.\n#### Other information about your system:\nThis issue does not happen on JAWS whether the setting to keep bluetooth alive is enabled or not. The headphones don't seem to go into standby mode at all when using the Stealth 700s.\n### Other questions\n#### Does the issue still occur after restarting your computer?\nYes\n#### Have you tried any other versions of NVDA? If so, please report their behaviors.\nNo\n#### If NVDA add-ons are disabled, is your problem still occurring?\nYes\n#### Does the issue still occur after you run the COM Registration Fixing Tool in NVDA's tools menu?\nYes",

In my initial post I gave two example methods that are commonly used, but I don???t know if either of those are use, or if another is used. \r\n\r\nWhat I???m actually trying to understand is the computational complexity of creating a single node. To know that I need to know how many splits are calculated at each node.", "@howarth got it. Working on it", "@howarth \r\n**Current Approach:**\r\nScikit-learn's decision tree implementation uses the \"best split\" strategy as the default approach to identify candidate splits. This means that for each feature, all unique values present in the training data are considered as potential splitting points. The criterion (e.g., Gini impurity or entropy) is computed for each unique value, and the value that maximizes the reduction in impurity is selected as the splitting point for that feature.\r\n\r\n**Alternative/Fix:**\r\nIf you are interested in an alternative approach for selecting candidate splits, you could consider using the \"random split\" strategy. In this approach, you randomly choose a subset of candidate values from the feature's range and evaluate the criterion for each of those values. This can significantly reduce the computational complexity, especially for features with a large number of unique values.\r\n\r\n**Code Location:**\r\nIf you want to delve into the code to understand how candidate splits are identified, you can look into the _splitter.pyx file in scikit-learn's source code. This file contains the core logic for finding the best split in decision trees. Specifically, you can explore the `BestSplitter` class, where the process of finding the best split point is implemented. You can find this here:\r\nhttps://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/main/sklearn/tree/_splitter.pyx", "@AyushChauhan-ui thank you! ", "@howarth , @AyushChauhan-ui , in the scikit-learn documentation , there is no detailed documentation for gini, variance reduction (which is used for regression trees) , entropy, information gain . Also there is one more splitting method we could add called chi-square splitting method. ", "Also the complexity that is mentioned is for binary trees and nothing specific about what is the computational complexity for particular decision tree algorithms like CART , ID3. That could be added too.", "> @howarth , @AyushChauhan-ui , in the scikit-learn documentation , there is no detailed documentation for gini, variance reduction (which is used for regression trees) , entropy, information gain . \r\n\r\nhttps://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html#mathematical-formulation\r\n", "> [...] for regression, an exhaustive method would be to sort each feature and then use the halfway point between each feature value. In this case there would be O(N*F) candidate splits where N=# data and F= # features. Another way would be to randomly choose K values between the min and max of each feature.\r\n\r\nIt's the former. See e.g. https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/a05eb6bbe30bc40904274c87afb4ac93bcd60168/sklearn/tree/_splitter.pyx#L472\r\n\r\nI don't think it's essential to spell this out in the User Guide, but I also don't think it would hurt. There have been some alternatives used, like left or right endpoints instead of midpoints, see e.g. https://datascience.stackexchange.com/q/32638/55122\r\n\r\nAlso, uniform selection in the feature range _is_ used, e.g. in IsolationForests.", "> Also the complexity that is mentioned is for binary trees and nothing specific about what is the computational complexity for particular decision tree algorithms like CART , ID3. That could be added too.\r\n\r\nScikit-learn implements CART. This is indeed a decision tree and the complexity for nodes, and tree is specified there: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html#complexity.\r\n\r\nWhile complexity is interesting, it will not give you the info about the splitter. Also the original question was something about random forest while here we are speaking decision tree.\r\n\r\nSo I see several documentation improvement:\r\n\r\n- [x] Improve the docstring of the `RandomForestClassifier` and `RandomForestRegressor` to make it obvious that the decision tree used under the hood are using `splitter=\"best\"`. I see that the `RandomForestRegressor` docstring is wrong because it refers to decision tree classifiers instead of regressors (it should be corrected as well).\r\n- [ ] Improve the user guide (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#random-forests) for the Random Forest to also mention that we use the best splitter for those.\r\n- [ ] Improve the user guide (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html#tree) of the decision tree such that we explain the best/random search. As far I can say, the requested information by @howarth could have been made explicit in the first paragraph of the \"Mathematical formulation\". This section is kind of written having the best splitter in mind, so we would need to either create a section or rework the narrative. I would see a section for finding the best split (the current narrative is nice) and add that split candidate are assessed exhaustively by a brute-force approach. Then, in the next section, I would explain the random approach simply by stating that we pick up a single split candidate randomly by feature.\r\n\r\nAn important point while modifying the documentation is to keep it as simple as possible and as succinct as possible as well.", "/take", "Hi all,\n\nThanks for the detailed discussion. I???ve reviewed the thread and code references. I???d be happy to help improve the documentation for RandomForestClassifier and RandomForestRegressor, especially around clarifying the use of the splitter=\"best\" strategy and how candidate splits are selected.\n\nI???ll start by drafting additions for:\n\nThe RandomForest* class docstrings to mention the best splitter.\n\nA short explanation in the [Random Forests user guide](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#random-forests) referencing that candidate splits are selected exhaustively per feature, using midpoint thresholds.\n\nPossibly extending the [Decision Trees guide](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html#tree) with a brief ???Finding the Best Split??? subsection for clarity.\n\nLet me know if that direction sounds good.

They also prevent creating a unique index which can be useful for logical replication.\n\n### To reproduce\n1. Connect to the `arbitrum` Postgres instance.\n2. Run. \n    ```\n    SELECT encode(order_uid, 'hex')  AS order_uid_hex,\n       \"timestamp\",\n       label\n    FROM (\n    SELECT *,\n           COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY order_uid, \"timestamp\", label) AS dup_cnt\n    FROM   order_events\n    WHERE  label = 'created'          -- filter early\n    ) t\n    WHERE dup_cnt > 1                     -- keep only real duplicates\n    LIMIT 10;\n    ```\n3. Observe that dup_cnt > 1 for the returned rows.\n\n### Expected behaviour\nFor any given (order_uid, timestamp, label='created') combination, there should be exactly one row in order_events.\n\n### Screenshots/logs\n<img width=\"817\" height=\"288\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23a8601b-8078-4ac0-85de-ea63c4cb6e2f\" />\n",

      "description" : "\n**Feature Request**\n\nEnable Intlayer to load i18n resources structured as `**/{locale}/{namespace}.json`, commonly used by libraries such as **i18next**, **next-intl**, and **vue-i18n**.\n\n### Motivation\n\nTo facilitate smooth migrations from popular internationalization libraries, we should support reading JSON resource files that follow the `{locale}/{namespace}.json` pattern. This makes it easier for developers to adopt **Intlayer** without having to restructure their existing i18n files.\n\n---\n\n### Proposal\n\nIntroduce support for dynamically loading and flattening these JSON resources via a configuration helper, such as `ressourcesListener`.\n\n**Example usage in `intlayer.config.ts`:**\n\n```ts\nimport { Locales, type IntlayerConfig, ressourcesListener } from 'intlayer';\nimport appDirEs from \"./ressources/es/app.json\"\n\nconst config: IntlayerConfig = {\n  internationalization: {\n    locales: [Locales.ENGLISH, Locales.FRENCH, Locales.SPANISH],\n    defaultLocale: Locales.ENGLISH,\n  },\n  content: {\n    contentDir: ['.'], // watch content declaration files from the project root\n    ressources: {\n      app: {\n        en: import('./ressources/en/app.json'),\n        fr: require('./ressources/fr/app.json'),\n        es: appDirEs,\n      },\n      ...ressourcesListener(\"./ressources/{locale}/{namespace}.json\"),\n    },\n  },\n};\n\nexport default config;\n```\n\n---\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe `ressourcesListener` utility should:\n\n* Automatically traverse paths matching the pattern\n* Populate the `ressources` object by extracting `locale` and `namespace`\n* Output a structure like:\n\n```ts\n{\n  app: {\n    en: { title: \"Hello\" },\n    fr: { title: \"Bonjour\" },\n    es: { title: \"Hola\" }\n  },\n  ...\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Benefit\n\n* Eases migration from existing i18n systems\n* Promotes compatibility with widely adopted file organization practices\n* Encourages contribution and adoption from larger frontend communities\n\n---\n\n### Implementation Notes (suggested)\n\n* Use `glob` or similar to find matching files\n* Extract `{locale}` and `{namespace}` via regex from file paths\n* Implement `ressourceListerner` function into `@intlayer/core` package and reexport it into `intlayer` package\n* Add configuration field at `packages/@intlayer/config/src/configFile/buildConfigurationFields.ts`\n* Add a loadICURessources function called at `packages/@intlayer/chokidar/src/loadDictionaries/loadDictionaries.ts` executed after `loadContentDeclarations`\n* Read json files using `packages/@intlayer/config/src/loadExternalFile.ts`\n\n---\n\n### AC \n* ICU ressources can be enriched using additional content declaration. Both together will be merged in a dimilar way than distant and locale content declaration are merged at the `packages/@intlayer/chokidar/src/transpiler/declaration_file_to_dictionary/intlayer_dictionary/buildIntlayerDictionary.ts` stage.

This means we've worked to make it more legible to folks who either **haven't contributed to our codebase before, or even folks who haven't contributed to open source before**. \r\n\r\nIf that's you, we're interested in helping you take the first step and can answer questions and help you out as you do. Note that we're especially interested in contributions from people from groups underrepresented in free and open source software!\r\n\r\nWe know that the process of creating a pull request is the biggest barrier for new contributors. This issue is for you \uD83D\uDC9D\r\n\r\nIf you have contributed before, **consider leaving this one for someone new**, and looking through our general [help wanted](https://github.com/publiclab/simple-data-grapher/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) issues. Thanks!\r\n\r\n### \uD83E\uDD14 What you will need to know.\r\n\r\nNothing. This issue is meant to welcome you to Open Source :) We are happy to walk you through the process.\r\n\r\n### Problem\r\n\r\n\r\n### \uD83D\uDCCBSolution\r\n\r\n- [ ] \uD83D\uDE4B **Claim this issue**: Comment below.

Thus it makes sense to have a recipe to rename the fields not to have these `_` prefixes/suffixes.\n\n## Describe the situation before applying the recipe\n```java\npublic class ParseLocation {\n  private String _ruleName;\n\n  public String getRuleName() {\n    return _ruleName;\n  }\n  public void setRuleName(String ruleName) {\n    _ruleName = ruleName;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Describe the situation after applying the recipe\n```java\npublic class ParseLocation {\n  private String ruleName;\n\n  public String getRuleName() {\n    return ruleName;\n  }\n  public void setRuleName(String ruleName) {\n    this.ruleName = ruleName;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Any additional context\n- When making the changes, beware of name clashes.

Please describe.\r\nI wanted to fit my data with a uniform distribution (I know the simple analytical answer), but it turned out that it's not possible to set bounds for it. [RooUniform](https://root.cern/doc/master/classRooUniform.html) creates a uniform distribution for the whole range of its variable (or many variables in the case of many dimensions).\r\n\r\nOn the [forum](https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/rooaddpdf-sum-of-uniform-distributions/18927/2) @lmoneta writes in 2015: \"You cannot really assign weights to a RooUniformPdf.\" (but probably this has already changed, because I see that it is a subclass of RooAbsPdf, like RooGaussian).\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nChange the constructor to\r\n\r\n    RooUniform(const char *name, const char *title, RooAbsReal &x_low, RooAbsReal &x_up)\r\n\r\nOne- and multidimensional uniform distributions should become separate (like [RooGaussian](https://root.cern/doc/master/classRooGaussian.html) and [RooMultiVarGaussian](https://root.cern/doc/master/classRooMultiVarGaussian.html) (note also a spurious line break in its docs)). Probably there is even no need for the multidimensional uniform distribution, since it's just a product of one-dimensional pdfs (if you don't model complicated support shapes).\r\n\r\nThe uniform (rectangular) distribution is just one of pdfs (see Wikipedia, [Continuous uniform distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_uniform_distribution)). It is a normal pdf, and its parameters are its lower and upper bounds. They should be set like other pdf parameters in RooFit.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nI think that there are no alternatives. No reason to model this with step functions or histograms. The uniform distribution is a simple and pretty basic probability distribution.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\nI [asked about this on the forum](https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/uniform-rectangular-pdf-with-variable-range/44232), but now as I better understand RooFit and as I see no answers for RooUniform, I think this is the only solution.\r\n\r\nP.S. There is a spurious line break in RooUniform class description.",

      "comments" : [ "Hi @ynikitenko, sorry for coming back to this issue so late! But I think I have now a compromise solution.\n\nThe problem is that adding new parameters to the RooUniform would mean adding new serializable class members, which might have unpleasant implications, for example of RooWorkspace size and would also need to be discussed with the HS3 serialization guys, which also have specified a uniform distribution.\n\n> The uniform (rectangular) distribution is just one of pdfs (see Wikipedia, [Continuous uniform distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_uniform_distribution)). It is a normal pdf, and its parameters are its lower and upper bounds. They should be set like other pdf parameters in RooFit.\n\nWell, that's your opinion and it might be the right claim. But one might also argue that the parameters are already encoded in the observable range. And if you introduce additional parameters within the full range, the pdf is not uniform within the full observable range anymore, which can be confusing given the name \"RooUniform\".\n\n> I think that there are no alternatives. No reason to model this with step functions or histograms.\n\nWhy not? There is an alternative. You can wrap a step function (\"RooStepFunction\") with only one interval in a RooWrapper pdf, and you have a uniform pdf as you describe:\n```c++\n   RooRealVar x{\"x\", \"x\", 5.0, 0.0, 10.0};\n   RooRealVar a{\"a\", \"a\", 3.0, 0.0, 10.0};\n   RooRealVar b{\"b\", \"b\", 7.0, 0.0, 10.0};\n\n   RooStepFunction stepFunc{\"step\", \"\", x, RooArgList{1.0}, {a, b}};\n   RooWrapperPdf stepPdf{\"pdf\", \"\", stepFunc};\n```\nThe non-boundary related parameter can be an arbitrary constant since it is normalized out.\n\nThe only problem with this approach is that right now RooFit doesn't know how to analytically normalize this pdf, but I have opened a PR to make this work:\n\n  * https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/17593\n\nIs this an acceptable compromise to you towards closing the issue?", "Closing after merging the suggested alternative. Feel free to open a new issue or reopen this one if this doesn't work for you!", "Hi @guitargeek . That is fine. I have already forgotten the logic behind that feature request (how it is connected with the rest of the RooFit ecosystem), but I'll do my best to answer your update!\n\n> The problem is that adding new parameters to the RooUniform would mean adding new serializable class members\n\nI think that this should not be an issue. If one wants constant interface, they don't update the code, right? My goal was how to improve the existing interface.\n\n> But one might also argue that the parameters are already encoded in the observable range.\n\nI believe that would make it consistent with other RooPdfs. Every RooPdf can have use that same variable. For some pdfs there are areas where the pdf can be zero, and it is fine.\nOr how is it done for other pdfs? Are they defined for the whole range of the variable?\n\n> You can wrap a step function (\"RooStepFunction\")\n\nThank you. However, that approach looks complicated. And it is different from how other pdfs are created.\n\nSo is there a simple way to create that simple pdf? Maybe you could create a pdf with a different name for that purpose, if you need a uniform pdf for the whole variable range?\n\nSorry, I completely forgot RooFit logic throughout that time. Please re-open the issue as you suggested, I don't have a permission for that.\n\nI think that supporting analytical integration of RooStepFunction is a good improvement for that, but it doesn't make creating a uniform pdf really easy.\n\nThank you." ],

When `DEFAULT_SSH_OPTIONS` were added *before* `configure_ssh_options()`, the values from the defaults were taking precedence.\n\nHere's what I observed in the `rsync` command before any changes:\n\n```bash\n11:39:38         Run command: rsync -s -p --chmod=755 -e 'ssh -oForwardX11=no -oStrictHostKeyChecking=no -oUserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -oConnectionAttempts=5 -oConnectTimeout=60 -oServerAliveInterval=5 -oServerAliveCountMax=60 -oServerAliveCountMax=9 -oServerAliveInterval=7 -oIdentitiesOnly=yes -p10025 -i /tmp/something/plan/provision/default-0/id_ecdsa -oPasswordAuthentication=no -S/tmp/something/ssh-sockets/127.0.0.1-10025-root.socket' /tmp/something/plan/discover/default-0/tests/tmt-test-wrapper-outer.sh-smoke-1-default-0-default-0 root@127.0.0.1:/tmp/something/plan/discover/default-0/tests/tmt-test-wrapper-outer.sh-smoke-1-default-0-default-0\n```\n\nNotice how `-oServerAliveInterval=5 -oServerAliveCountMax=60` (likely from `DEFAULT_SSH_OPTIONS`) appears *before* the desired `-oServerAliveCountMax=9 -oServerAliveInterval=7` (from environment variables). SSH processes options in order, so the earlier ones effectively override the later ones if they're the same type.\n\n-----\n\n### Proposed Solution / Fix (and its effect) \n\nBy changing the order of concatenation for `BASE_SSH_OPTIONS` to:\n\n`BASE_SSH_OPTIONS: tmt.utils.RawCommand = configure_ssh_options() + DEFAULT_SSH_OPTIONS`\n\n...we ensure that the custom options (derived from environment variables via `configure_ssh_options()`) are added *first*. This makes them the effective options for the `ssh` command.\n\nHere's the `rsync` command output **after** this change:\n\n```bash\n11:09:52         Run command: rsync -s -R -r -z --links --safe-links --protect-args --exclude /tmp/something/plan/execute/data/guest/default-0/smoke-1/output.txt --exclude /tmp/something/plan/execute/data/guest/default-0/smoke-1/output.txt -e 'ssh -oServerAliveCountMax=9 -oServerAliveInterval=7 -oForwardX11=no -oStrictHostKeyChecking=no -oUserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -oConnectionAttempts=5 -oConnectTimeout=60 -oServerAliveInterval=5 -oServerAliveCountMax=60 -oIdentitiesOnly=yes -p10025 -i /tmp/something/plan/provision/default-0/id_ecdsa -oPasswordAuthentication=no -S/tmp/something/ssh-sockets/127.0.0.1-10025-root.socket' root@127.0.0.1:/tmp/something/plan/data /\n```\n\nAs you can see, `-oServerAliveCountMax=9 -oServerAliveInterval=7` now appears at the beginning of the SSH options, confirming that our custom settings are correctly applied.\n\nThis change should resolve any issues where custom `ServerAliveInterval` and `ServerAliveCountMax` values weren't being honored.\n\n--- \n\nAs a next step , for command line options . Let me verify as Petr said\n>  We should just ensure the expectation that ssh always picks the first provided option is true.\n", "# SSH Option Precedence: Test Results\n\nWe've observed varied precedence rules for SSH command-line options. Here's a quick rundown:\n\n---\n\n## First One Wins (for some value assignments)\n\nFor options that assign a specific value, like port or user, the **first one specified takes effect**:\n\n* **Port (`-p`)**:\n    `ssh user@host -p 2222 -p 22` will connect to **port 2222**.\n* **User (`-l`)**:\n    `ssh -l vaibhav -l root host` will attempt to log in as **vaibhav**.\n\n\n## All Are Considered (for lists)\n\nWhen providing multiple instances of options that take a list (like identity files), SSH tries them **in order**:\n\n* **Identity File (`-i`)**:\n    `ssh user@host -i ~/.ssh/key1 -i ~/.ssh/key2` will attempt to authenticate with `key1`, then `key2` if `key1` fails.\n\n\n## Last One Wins (for conflicting flags)\n\nFor simple on/off flags, the **last one set overrides earlier ones**:\n\n* **Verbose/Quiet (`-v`/`-q`)**:\n    `ssh user@host -v -q` will run in **quiet** mode.\n    `ssh user@host -q -v` will run in **verbose** mode (to the highest level indicated by `-v`s).\n\n\n**Bottom line:** SSH command-line parsing isn't always \"last one wins.\" Behavior depends on the option type." ],

Once you implement in pharmaversesdtm, you can come back to this issue and use the new `dm` dataset to add AAGE/AAGEU to the ADSL template \uD83D\uDE04 \n\nPlease let @Lina2689 / @Fanny-Gautier know if you don't have access to pharmaversesdtm.", "If `Birth Date` is added to `pharmaversesdtm::dm`, it's important to double-check and list all _{admiral}_ extension packages that may be impacted by this update. For example, review where `dm` is used, as those packages may now include this new variable by default - even though `AGE` may have been manually derived or `Birth Date` manually added. I'm thinking of _{admiralpeds}_, where `BRTHDTC` was manually added in `dm_peds`. This change could have an impact, so it???s worth reviewing when the time comes.", "Thanks for making me aware of this! Is there somewhere we can see the dependencies? I would assume `dm` is used almost everywhere. I think it could be nice to have an overview of it before I start to make any changes ready.\nAlternatively, could it be an idea to add a \"new\" `dm` version called `dm_admiral`, as done with `dm_peds` if I understand you correctly?", "@SolveigHolmgaard it's a good question.\n\nLuckily we store the SDTM test data for all the {admiral} packages in the centralised [{pharmaversesdtm}](https://github.com/pharmaverse/pharmaversesdtm) package repo. You can see in the [data_raw](https://github.com/pharmaverse/pharmaversesdtm/tree/main/data-raw) folder that we already have a `dm.R` program which essentially just loads in the DM dataset from the CDISC pilot study, and then we currently have `dm_peds.R`, `dm_vaccine.R`, `dm_metabolic.R` which use `dm.R` as a starting point. As such I would take a look at those three files and assess the impact of adding `BRTHDTC` to `dm.R`, and make edits to them as well if need be. For instance, since `BRTHDTC` will now be (re)derived in `dm_peds.R` then perhaps we'll just need to pre-emptively drop `BRTHDTC` from DM at the start of that script. I'd also check out the other SDTM programs in that data-raw folder just to verify `BRTHDTC` is not used there, but I'd be very surprised if it were.\n\nOne final thing to note is that currently {admiralneuro}'s test SDTM datasets still live in the {admiralneuro} repo (we only move test data to {pharmaversesdtm} once the first release of a package is live) so for completeness I'd also assess impact similarly for that package - see [here](https://github.com/pharmaverse/admiralneuro/tree/main/data-raw))" ],

[(utils._set_output.py)](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/main/sklearn/utils/_set_output.py)\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef _auto_wrap_is_configured(estimator):\r\n    \"\"\"Return True if estimator is configured for auto-wrapping the transform method.\r\n\r\n    `_SetOutputMixin` sets `_sklearn_auto_wrap_output_keys` to `set()` if auto wrapping\r\n    is manually disabled.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    auto_wrap_output_keys = getattr(estimator, \"_sklearn_auto_wrap_output_keys\", set())\r\n    return (\r\n        hasattr(estimator, \"get_feature_names_out\")\r\n        and \"transform\" in auto_wrap_output_keys\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n To have **'get_feature_names_out'** attr, estimator should inherit OneToOneFeatureMixin as I think.

From memory, Sphinx will recognize everything that is defined in code. When I was debugging this, I did not find a way to hide the method from Sphinx. ", "> When I was debugging this, I did not find a way to hide the method from Sphinx.\n\ntechnically one case use the exclude-members option to hide certain methods\n\nhttps://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html#directive-option-autoclass-exclude-members", "/take", "I???ve looked into this, and indeed the root of the problem is how the [@available_if](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/543092020dc1bfa42b7722c9245b53cf277fe1b4/sklearn/utils/_available_if.py#L57) decorator works, as even though it makes `LabelEncoder().set_output` raise AttributeError, `set_output` is still in `dir(LabelEncoder)`, and `LabelEncoder.set_output` does give back the `_SetOutputMixin.set_output` method. So sphinx will find it as a member of the class to be documented ([see here](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/blob/ca043c3ccdc88ae5d30e4527382fe0c8bd5e2a88/sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py#L1968)).\n\nI see a few possible ways to remove the documentation:\n\n- I think the best solution would be to separate [`TransformerMixin`](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/543092020dc1bfa42b7722c9245b53cf277fe1b4/sklearn/base.py#L801) and [`_SetOutputMixin`](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/543092020dc1bfa42b7722c9245b53cf277fe1b4/sklearn/utils/_set_output.py#L347) (and expose the latter too), so have the `set_output` method opt-in instead of opt-out, but that would be a breaking change.\n\n- Adding `:exclude-members: set_output` to the [doc template](scikit-learn/doc/templates/base.rst) as @Remi-Gau suggested, but then it's never documented (maybe would be good as a temporary solution?).\n\n- For classes that don???t want to implement `set_output`, we could override it by one raising NotImplementedError (and having a docstring that makes sphinx skip it, by adding `:meta private:`), although that kind of goes against the magic using the `available_if` decorator and the `auto_wrap_output_keys` param. (Other such classes are LabelBinarizer, MultiLabelBinarizer, HashingVectorizer and TfidfTransformer.)\n\nWays that don???t work (currently):\n\n- In sphinx, one can connect a method to call back when autodoc is deciding wether a member should be documented or skipped [like here](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/bde701db13cebd5d5ed0bc049fb0bc9693c6c5dc/doc/conf.py#L848), but unfortunately (as of 8.1.3), is only gets the member method and not the parent class, so it???s not really possible to distinguish the `set_output` method of a class that has it or not, because it still exists in the cases when it???s not callable, and it???s the same function object (except maybe using inspect???).\n\n- Trying to remove the method with `delattr(LabelEncoder, \"set_output\")` raises AttributeError.\n\nAre there any preferences?", "There is a similar issue with linked PRs in https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/28558. In particular https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28749 was on a good trajectory to solving this but then the original PR creator closed it. Maybe worth restarting that PR\n\nThe issue solves a different, but I think, related problem: the fact that tab completion and `dir(some_estimator)` will list methods that don't exist because the default `__dir__` implementation doesn't understand the `available_if` decorator", "???Hi, I???d like to work on this. Can I take it????\n", "> ???Hi, I???d like to work on this. Can I take it????\n\nOk!", "/unassign\n", "@student-ChestaVashishtha  I don't know how I can unassign myself.
