      "description" : "**Describe the bug**\n\nThe Vega chart creation plugin is not properly registered in the main plugin system, making it completely non-functional despite existing in the codebase. The plugin implementation exists at vega.ts:8-52 and is configured in default settings at [[2](#9-1)](settings.json:432-434), but it's missing from the `availablePlugins` registry. This causes:\n\n1. The plugin doesn't appear in Settings ??? Plugins UI\n2. The plugin doesn't appear in per-LLM tool selection\n3. LLMs cannot call the `vega_chart_creation` function\n4. Vega charts are never generated, only raw JSON is returned\n\n**To Reproduce**\n\n1. Go to 'Settings' ??? 'Plugins' \n2. Notice that no \"Vega\" plugin appears in the list (despite existing in codebase)\n3. Go to 'Chat' ??? Select any LLM ??? Settings ??? Plugins Customize\n4. Notice that no \"Vega\" plugin appears in the list here either\n5. In any chat, prompt an LLM _either_: A: \"Use_ the vega_chart_creation function to create a bar chart\" _or_ B:  \"Create a Vega chart that displays a bar chart showing monthly sales data for the first 6 months of 2024: January: $45,000, February: $52,000, March: $48,000, April: $61,000, May: $58,000, June: $67,000. Generate a visualization so I can see it rendered inline in the chat and test the interactive features like theme switching, code viewing, and download functionality\"\n6. See that the LLM returns raw Vega JSON specification instead of calling the plugin function\n\n- Tested with multiple LLM providers: Grok 4, GPT-4.1, Kimi K2, and Claude Sonnet 4 - all exhibit the same behavior. Vega charts are never generated, only raw JSON is returned.\n\n**Expected behavior**\n1. IMO, the Vega plugin doesn't need to appear in Witsy's UI under Settings ??? Plugins. It should be enabled by default (same as mermaid diagrams)\n2. The plugin should however appear in the per-LLM tool selection interfaces (described in step 3. above, under \"To Reproduce\")\n3. LLMs should be able to call the `vega_chart_creation` function and render the charts\n4. The plugin should execute vega.ts:44-50 and generate PNG chart images that get embedded in chat responses\n\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\n - OS: macOS Sequoia 15.5\n - Witsy Version: 2.11.2 (1042)\n\n**Additional context**\nAs far as I can tell, the root cause is that the Vega plugin is not registered in the `availablePlugins` object. While the plugin implementation exists and is actually also referenced in the UI settings component SettingsPlugins.vue:64, it's never actually loaded by the plugin system base.ts:402-455.\n\nI think the fix would be to add `vega: VegaPlugin` to the `availablePlugins` registry along with the appropriate import statement. This would make the plugin available to both the UI system and the LLM loading mechanisms in base.ts:402-455.\n\nThis appears to be an incomplete feature integration where the plugin code was implemented but never properly wired into the main plugin architecture.",

Contact platform administrators.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason is that during registration, `pyflyte` does not realize that the object needs to be uploaded to blob storage. The user would have to proactively configure the raw data prefix.\r\n\r\nI would argue that this example is very difficult to understand and debug for users that don't have a clear understanding of Flyte's data model and too \"simple\" to let users fall into this trap.\r\n\r\nAs a user I would want flytekit to 1) realize that during registration, files need to be offloaded to blob storage and 2) the backend to specify a default raw data prefix during registration unless I configured it explicitly in my flyte config file.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHow could this be fixed?\r\n\r\nIn the `FileAccessProvider`, we need to prevent that [`put_raw_data`](https://github.com/flyteorg/flytekit/blob/6279b817d5df76e651c866c6c5ba7e12a65e12b2/flytekit/core/data_persistence.py#L285) stores offloaded objects locally during registration.\r\n\r\n* Is there a way to determine from \"the flyte context that we are in registration mode\"? Then we could at least catch this error and tell users to configure the raw data prefix.\r\n* Could `pyflyte` request the `raw_data_prefix` from `flyteadmin` if the user didn't set it explicitly and \"make the file access provider aware of it\"?</div>",

      "comments" : [ "# :wave: Important: PLEASE READ :wave:\n\nThis issue has been labeled as a **good first issue** and is available for anyone to work on.\n\nIf this is your first time contributing to an open source project, some aspects of the development process may seem unusual, arcane, or some combination of both.\n\n1.  **You cannot \"claim\" issues.** People new to open source often want to \"claim\" or be assigned an issue before beginning work. The typical rationale is that people want to avoid wasted work in the event that someone else ends up working the issue. However, this practice is not effective in open source, as it often leads to \"issue squatting\", in which an individual asks to be assigned, is granted their request, and then never ends up working on the issue. Accordingly, you are encouraged to communicate your intent to address this issue, ideally by providing a rough outline as to how you plan to address the issue or asking clarifying questions, but, at the end of the day, we will take running code and rough consensus in order to move forward quickly.\n2.  **We have a very high bar for contributions.** We have very high standards for contributions and expect all contributions???whether new features, tests, or documentation???to be rigorous, thorough, and complete. Once a pull request is merged into stdlib, that contribution immediately becomes the collective responsibility of all maintainers of stdlib. When we merge code into stdlib, we are saying that we, the maintainers, commit to reviewing subsequent changes and making bugfixes to the code. Hence, in order to ensure future maintainability, this naturally leads to a higher standard of contribution.\n\nBefore working on this issue and opening a pull request, please read the project's [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md). These guidelines and the associated [development guide](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/docs/contributing/development.md) provide important information, including links to stdlib's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), license policy, and steps for setting up your local development environment.\n\nTo reiterate, we **strongly** encourage you to refer to our contributing guides **before** beginning work on this issue. Failure to follow our guidelines significantly decreases the likelihood that you'll successfully contribute to stdlib and may result in automatic closure of a pull request without review.\n\nSetting up your local development environment is a critical first step, as doing so ensures that automated development processes for linting, license verification, and unit testing can run prior to authoring commits and pushing changes. If you would prefer to avoid manual setup, we provide pre-configured [development containers](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/tree/develop/.devcontainer) for use locally or in GitHub Codespaces.\n\nWe place a high value on consistency throughout the stdlib codebase. We encourage you to closely examine other packages in stdlib and attempt to emulate the practices and conventions found therein.\n\n-   If you are attempting to contribute a new package, sometimes the best approach is to simply copy the contents of an existing package and then modify the minimum amount necessary to implement the feature (e.g., changing descriptions, parameter names, and implementation).\n-   If you are contributing tests, find a package implementing a similar feature and emulate the tests of that package.\n-   If you are updating documentation, examine several similar packages and emulate the content, style, and prose of those packages.\n\nIn short, the more effort you put in to ensure that your contribution looks and feels like stdlib???including variables names, bracket spacing, line breaks, etc???the more likely that your contribution will be reviewed and ultimately accepted. We encourage you to closely study the codebase **before** beginning work on this issue.\n\n:sparkles: Thank you again for your interest in stdlib, and we look forward to reviewing your future contributions. :sparkles:\n" ],

      "description" : "### Is your improvement request related to a feature? Please describe (\uD83D\uDC4D if you like this request)\n\nRecently, one user reported that he needed to reuse a failed replica by modifying its disk and data directory, which is actually associated with an Orphan CR. After editing the replica spec, Longhorn was able to salvage the volume. But there is no perfect way to clean up the related Orphan CR based on my understanding then:\n- As long as [the associated node, disk, and data directory are reachable](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn-manager/blob/bb84ca8762db2089f17ec5d29743de2cb94b7a9f/controller/orphan_controller.go#L583), Longhorn will [blindly do data cleanup when deleting an Orphan](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn-manager/blob/bb84ca8762db2089f17ec5d29743de2cb94b7a9f/controller/orphan_controller.go#L351-L361)\n- [Orphan CR specs are immutable](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn-manager/blob/bb84ca8762db2089f17ec5d29743de2cb94b7a9f/webhook/resources/orphan/validator.go#L73C12-L73C32), we cannot make an Orphan condition `OrphanConditionTypeDataCleanable` become false by modifying its disk/directory to an invalid location.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nThe solution can be what Longhorn does for Backup CRs: When [label `DeleteCustomResourceOnly = \"delete-custom-resource-only\"`](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn-manager/blob/bb84ca8762db2089f17ec5d29743de2cb94b7a9f/types/types.go#L141) is set for an Orphan CR, Longhorn should skip the actual data cleanup.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\nNext, Longhorn should be able to directly restore a volume from an orphan without any manual operations mentioned above.

We believe a change needs to be made here: adding a boolean variable for our update BREE feature. We have been mimicking the **Remove Useless Files** feature because it is a feature that also has something to do with altering files. Can you please confirm this assumption?\n\nHowever, we noticed that some boolean values are initialized to `true` while others are initialized to `false`. \n\nWith the help of Claude.ai, we came to the understanding that the boolean initialization values reflect the default behavior that the processor should have when run without explicit configuration. \n`true`: for ???conservative, safe cleanup operations???\n`false`: for ???potentially destructive, performance-intensive, or structure-changing operations???\n\nOur hypothesis is that our boolean variable `fUpdateBREE` should be initialized to `false` since changing the BREE in a manifest across projects:\n\n- alters the project???s runtime requirements and compatibility promises\n\n- could break compatibility with existing deployment environments that expect a lower Java version\n\nIs our understanding correct? If not, is there an explanation for it?" ],

Especially with the codec pipeline in zarr being parallelized, the need for dask workers to be responsible for speeding up io is lessened and thus cramming more parallel reads within a worker is probably sensible.  I imagine the same is true for hdf5 even if it isn't parallel i.e., doing more/bigger reads per-dask-chunk.\n\nSee https://gist.github.com/lgarrison/ef2922fdb8ca78e8753c39758afedb56 for a related example of this issue where having few python process workers but utilizing the rust-based parallelization of `zarrs` improves throughput.\n\nSee https://github.com/zarrs/zarr_benchmarks/blob/9679f36ca795cce65adc603ae41147324208d3d9/scripts/zarr_dask_python_benchmark_roundtrip.py#L22 for using `shards` as the chunk size for dask (since shards contain chunks) as a starting point for implementing better defaults.\n\nIn general some todos:\n\n- [ ] Use shards when applicable for zarr\n- [ ] Create benchmarks for unsharded data in hdf5 and zarr to find the virtual vs. on-disk chunk size performance tradeoff\n- [ ] Write some sort of general-purpose function that can be reused across zarr/hdf5",

      "description" : "### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.\n\nI'm in the middle of moving, and have spent the last few weeks with a steel cargo container in my yard. Every time I see it, every single time, I think \"why don't we have these in CDDA!?\"\n\nIt is possible I have a problem.\n\nThat problem is, of course, THE LACK OF INTERMODAL TRANSPORT CONTAINERS.\n\nFor reference, these bad boys are what we're talking about.\n<img width=\"257\" height=\"196\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40414994-d3b4-479f-807b-83df2bb3a527\" />\n\n<img width=\"273\" height=\"185\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0fdc8409-ee63-481d-8cf6-f5ae9af7c0a4\" />\n\n### Solution you would like.\n\nI believe an intermodal containers should be a vehicle. The first and most important way to model them is as a vehicle, and for that we should have a few custom vehicle panels so that I can sprite them to look like what they are: the intermodal container is a very well recognized structure, and missing them in game is a big deal.\n\nAs a start, I'd just love to see someone go to the work of designing them, and maybe putting a few of them rarely in front of houses, and frequently in various industrial places. Then, in follow up, we can have some that contain interesting or boring things. Eventually we should see these in railyards and shipyards in huge numbers. However, those are later steps. This is a good first issue for someone who wants to learn how to make a custom vehicle in JSON, but it is a little bit involved so while I am flagging it \"good first issue\", I really recommend doing something very very small and trivial for your *first* first issue.\n\n#### How I'd design them:\nIntermodal containers are typically 8' x 20' or 8' x 40'. The 20' variety should look like this:\n```\nWWWWW\nWfffW\nWfffW\nWfffW\nWfffW\nWfffW\nWfffW\nWfffW\nWfffW\nWfffW\nWfffW\nWfffW\nWDDDW\n```\nWhere W is a full height vehicle wall with a new custom panel style, \"transport_container\" - which comes in \"container_side\", \"container_door_corner\", \"container_end_corner\", and \"container_end\"\nAnd where D is a vehicle door similar to the trunk, where opening one door opens both doors, with a new custom sprite as well.\n- Ideally, but not necessary, we could add code where opening one door opens the door next to it, but not all three doors, so that opening the middle tile opens both but opening the left tile opens only the left and middle and opening the right opens the right and middle. That would let us model it as two doors despite taking three tiles. However, I think doing it all as one door is the easiest way and we already have that code.\n- These doors should be very loud to open! And a bit slow.\nAnd where `f` is probably just standard cargo storage space, but with a new visual variant.\n\nWe could add the 40' variety but as you see, they'd get pretty long in game.\n\n### Describe alternatives you have considered.\n\nThere was a time when I thought we'd also want them as terrain so that we could have furniture in them, but now that we can drag furniture into vehicles, that might not be necessary. For starters, we should get htese as vehicles and see how it works.\n\nIf we model them as vehicles then you can push them around and things, which is sooooo aaawwwweesome.\n\n### Additional context\n\nLong-term, I would like to have different colour choices for these and put them into a vehicle group so you can just place a 'container' and get different skins. Then I might also be able to work in a few with graffiti and stuff, which would really enhance the look, but the odds of me getting that much sprite art done without getting distracted are... not great.\n\nIn the future, it may be possible to repurpose bicycle code to load intermodal containers onto appropriate flatbed trucks. That would be amazing\n\nEventually, intermodal containers would be a good way to begin thinking about some simple multi-z-level vehicle code, allowing us to stack them on top of each other.",

Do we want to group safety with intersections or with transportation? Arguably the intersections are a type of safety callout, but perhaps the point of separating the intersection callout toggle is to allow everything except intersections to continue being called out.", "That's a great point :-) Perhaps we split out all 3 separately? All the other Callout options are quite binary whereas this one currently incorporates 3 different types...so splitting them out will allow a person to fine-tune the information they wish to hear. It will increase the panel and require more scrolling for the page...but I think it's worth doing. ", "\nI could also argue that the safety spots callout should remain on unless the user decides to turn all callouts off. In the early days of Microsoft Soundscape, there used to be a toggle switch for the Location Updates callout, but starting around the early 2020's,the Location Updates callout became permanently turned on and cannot directly be configured by the user. My argument to leave safety spots on is so that the user is always aware of anything hazardous while walking around. That way the \"Manage Callouts\" menu wouldn't be cluttered with too many configurations. If we decide to go ahead with my solution, I also wrote a revision to the help documentation explaining \"Note: some callouts essential for safe navigation do not have their own toggle switch and can only be disabled with the \"Allow Callouts\" button.\" Anyway, having all three callouts in this section or just Transportation and Intersections will be an improvement, even for sighted users. The term Mobility isn't as intuitive for the average user.", "I can look into this ", "Do we know which files in the backend are connected to the different toggles that we want from the Mobility section?

You don't need to dive into how those settings are used by the `AutoCalloutGenerator` to filter the announcements.", "Just for clarification, I separated Transportation and Intersection into 2 different toggles.

The following pages should help you to get started:\n- https://github.com/eclipse-ide/\n- https://github.com/eclipse-pde/eclipse.pde?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-contribute\n\nand if you have further questions, don't hesitate to ask, we are here to help.", "Hey guys, I'm working on this issue in a group with ahenden13. We were wondering if anybody has thoughts on how we should format the display, as there is a lot of unhelpful information. \n\nWe are inclined to just remove these useless bits, but we could also just remove the error bits, leave everything and bold the set bits, etc. If anyone has any input it would be appreciated!", "I think the main issue is that you can not know programmatically what styles a widget support at the moment.\n\nSo the first thing would be to have some declarative way (e.g. an annotation) to carry that information and update all widgets to use that thing before one can make progress here. Hardcoding the supported styles seem not very useful to me.", "That makes a lot of sense. We found the method getStyle() in [SpyView.java](https://github.com/eclipse-pde/eclipse.pde/blob/master/ui/org.eclipse.swt.tools.spies/src/org/eclipse/swt/tools/views/SpyView.java) which we could borrow to easily grab only the relevant style bits for a given widget and then bold the styles that are currently being used. The downside to this function is that it uses a lot of long if...else statements to manually grab the set style bits one by one, with hardcoded styles. We have a solution ready to go using this method, and we could do a PR right now.\n\nWhat you are advising is we instead use something like an annotation. We could try to build this and do a PR for SWT, or we could try to build a similar solution within Eclipse PDE. For example, we could use a format like a registry of SWT styles, which might look something like:\n\npublic class Registry {\n    private hashmap;\n\n    static {\n        hashmap.put(Button.class, Set.of(\n            SWT.PUSH,\n            SWT.CHECK,\n            SWT.RADIO,\n            SWT.TOGGLE\n        ));\n\n        //etc\n    }\n\n    public static Set<Integer> getStyles(Class) {\n        // return styles for a given class\n    }\n}\n\nThis is probably less optimal than adding something to the widget class directly, but it is a lot more human-readable than the getStyle() idea and allows us to update everything a lot easier down the line. \n\nWhat should our next steps be? Should we do a PR with what we have now, build a new solution in the format I described here, try to create a solution by modifying the widget class itself, or do something else?", "> What you are advising is we instead use something like an annotation.\n\nI do not advise to use _something like an annotation_ but to use an annotation. e.g it could be a repeatable `@Style` with and int value and an optional String description. If we choose retention of runtime that information could be easily queried by tools (even e.g. in autocompletion or validation) to learn about valid styles what currently is only documented in the javadoc (and sadly even only in the class description and not at the constructor).\n\n> The downside to this function is that it uses a lot of long if...else statements to manually grab the set style bits one by one, with hardcoded styles.\n\nThe most limiting factor is that there is literally no way for it to be used with custom widgets outside of what we know at platform / SWT.", "Hello @laeubi,\n\nI am in team with @WillPeltz  & @ahenden13. We were exploring information regarding Annotations. Based on our understanding here is what we came up with\n\n```\nimport java.lang.annotation.Retention;\nimport java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy;\nimport java.lang.annotation.Repeatable;\n\n@Repeatable(Styles.class)\n@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)\npublic @interface Style {\n    int value();                //Store style value i.e. SWT.BORDER\n    String description() default \"\";  //  A description = Creates a Border\n}\n\n\nContainer to support repeatability (For multiple styles in a widget)\nimport java.lang.annotation.Retention;\nimport java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy;\n\n@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)\npublic @interface Styles {\n    Style[] value();\n}\n```\nWe could put this interface in the SWT repositories or make a wrapper class in PDE.\n\nDoes this align with the approach you have in your mind? \n\nThank you so much!\n" ],

If memory serves, that was just an issue in the test itself (like a copy+paste error from the navigate to pose tests), not in the application code.\n\nI'm not worried about the linting, some of the backports we did probably broke Humble's styling but were correct styling for the modern linter profiles.

It seems that I have been successful in building and running the Eclipse IDE in general since now I can run any Java file in example folders such as SWTExamples/org.eclipse.swt.examples/org.eclipse.swt.examples.helloworld/. The java files in these different example folders have code that implement functions from the SWT library, hence I was able to run HelloWorld3.java. However, when it comes to the issue itself we are given a snippet of code from Issue #1599???s documentation. For some reason we cannot reproduce the error, even if I were to copy and paste the code into a working Java file such as HelloWorld3.java. All of the import statements at the top of the code that import functions and widgets from the SWT library are not highlighted as errors, but anything with import org.eclipse.jface???. and org.eclipse.junit???. are highlighted as errors. I have tried seeing if I could manually install a plugin for jface and junit but could not manage to do it, and I???ve even commented out the import statements that have jface and junit in them. But some parts of the code use Junit for building UI dialogs, and some of the code is used for automatic testing which is done with Junit. JFace is just built on top of SWT, so the UI dialog features that it provides really comes from SWT itself. JUnit is just for automatic testing, but not directly part of the code for reproduction. What I hypothesize is that we do not need JFace or JUnit at all to reproduce the issue. If JFace just uses similar components of SWT that it is built upon, then I believe it is possible to code a similar program without JFace while still reproducing the issue. As for JUnit I do not believe automatic testing is dire for us to see the bug when running the application, so we can also code a program that simulates the bug without that bug. Is my understanding correct? Any feedback would be highly appreciated.\n\n\n\n@grissinibread \n" ],

      "description" : "### \uD83D\uDD0D Motivation\n\nCitation count provides a useful indicator of the academic impact of a publication. Automating the population of this field from Semantic Scholar saves manual effort and enhances bibliographic data quality in JabRef.\n\n### \uD83D\uDCCC Goal\n\nExtend the existing `SemanticScholarCitationFetcher` to retrieve the **citation count** for a given paper using the Semantic Scholar API and store it in a new BibTeX field `citationcount`.\n\n### \uD83D\uDEE0??? Tasks\n\n1. **Integrate citation count fetching**\n\n   * Implement logic in `org.jabref.logic.importer.fetcher.citation.semanticscholar.SemanticScholarCitationFetcher` using\n     `PaperDetails#getCitationCount()` from\n     `org.jabref.logic.importer.fetcher.citation.semanticscholar.PaperDetails`.\n\n2. **Add a new field**\n\n   * Define a new field `citationcount` in `org.jabref.model.entry.field.StandardField` (under JabRef-specific fields).\n   * Ensure that the field is recognized and included in citation fetcher updates.\n\n3. **Write tests**\n\n   * Add unit tests in\n     `org.jabref.logic.importer.fetcher.citation.semanticscholar.SemanticScholarCitationFetcherTest`\n     to verify that citation count is fetched and set correctly.\n   * Additonally, Mock or simulate Semantic Scholar API responses with citation counts.\n\n4. **UI integration**\n\n    * Add a new FieldEditor `CitationCount` (inspired by IdentifierEditor) and integrate it into the UI by modifying FieldEditors#getForField(...).\n    * Add an update button, which uses the SemanticScholarFEtcher to update the citation cound.\n\n### ??? Acceptance Criteria\n\n* When the fetcher is run on an entry with a DOI or title, and Semantic Scholar returns a citation count, the value is written to the `citationcount` field.\n* The value is stored as an integer.\n* Field appears in the entry editor in tab \"General\"\n\n\n### \uD83D\uDCDA Helpful resources\n\n* [[Semantic Scholar API](https://api.semanticscholar.org/)](https://api.semanticscholar.org/)\n* [`[PaperDetails](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/src/main/java/org/jabref/logic/importer/fetcher/citation/semanticscholar/PaperDetails.java)`](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/src/main/java/org/jabref/logic/importer/fetcher/citation/semanticscholar/PaperDetails.java)\n* [`[SemanticScholarCitationFetcher](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/src/main/java/org/jabref/logic/importer/fetcher/citation/semanticscholar/SemanticScholarCitationFetcher.java)`](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/src/main/java/org/jabref/logic/importer/fetcher/citation/semanticscholar/SemanticScholarCitationFetcher.java)\n* [[How to contribute to JabRef](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n* [[Developer Docs](https://devdocs.jabref.org/)](https://devdocs.jabref.org/)\n\n",

      "description" : "This issue lists areas that are good entry points to start contributing to opentelemetry-cpp.\n\nFor each issue, see the issue comments for details.\n\n## 1. Functional\n\nTypically, features touching a functional area requires to dive into the code, but do not need changes in the infrastructure, like CI, workflows, compilers, platforms, makefiles ...\nThis is a good opportunity to learn the C++ code itself. The size of the code affected varies by feature.\n\n### 1.1 All signals\n\nTypically, changes affecting all signals at once are using the same pattern, applied everywhere.\nThe change is limited in scope, but touches multiple parts.\nThis is a good opportunity to learn how to apply design or coding pattern to an existing code base.\n\n* #3303\n\n### 1.2 Resource detector\n\n* #3548 \n\n### 1.3 Trace signal\n\n* #2283 \n* #3545\n\n### 1.4 Metrics signal\n\nTypically, changes affecting the metrics signal are more involved on the functional part (time series, aggregation).\nThis is a good opportunity to understand in depth a component, with clear boundaries.\n\n* #3292\n* #3515\n* #3546\n\n### 1.5 Logs signal\n\n* #2689\n* #2667\n\n### 1.6 Specific areas\n\nTypically, features touching a specific area do not require to understand the whole code base, but only a well defined subset.\nThis is a good opportunity to learn the development process (git, PR, review, merge) as well as the affected code.\n\n* #2489\n\n## 2. Code health\n\nThis area requires to change `CI`/`CD` scripts to improve the build process.\nThis is a very good opportunity to learn the github `CI` workflow, to implement new tooling.\n\n### 2.1 Clang-tidy\n\nIterative changes, to expand coverage to the entire code base.\n\n* #2053\n\n### 2.2 Doxygen\n\n* #1647\n\n## 3. Test coverage\n\nThis area is a very good opportunity to learn `docker` to execute tests in a container environment.\n\n* #454\n\n## 4. Documentation\n\nThis is internal documentation, for maintainers.\nWe need to document internal processes (like, how to do a release, an upgrade, a deprecation, ...),\nas well as feature design (explain how xyz works) at high level, to understand the code base.\n\n* #2678\n\n## 5. Major work\n\nSome areas in opentelemetry-cpp need major work, and contributions are welcome here as well.\n\nA couple of things to keep in mind:\n\n* These are definitively not \"good first issue\" items, you should have contributed already to opentelemetry-cpp (to be familiar with the process and tooling) and have some experience to be effective.\n* Not every technical aspects are defined yet, a good part of the work will be to propose what needs to be done first.\n* Maintainers are here to help and facilitate this, and will provide guidance.\n* Consider to join the community meetings to discuss specific areas.\n\n### 5.1 Binary packages\n\nTo be able to ship binary packages for opentelemetry-cpp, a lot of preliminary work needs to happen\n\n* [ ] Define how shared libraries are to be versioned, to support compatibility with ABI versions and SDK versions\n  * #3110\n* [ ] Implement tooling to verify shared libraries compatibility\n  * #1996\n* [ ] Reduce technical dependencies in the code base\n  * #1429\n* [ ] Define packages scope\n  * #2682\n\n### 5.2 Full Windows support\n\nTo instrument an application using only opentelemetry-cpp api, the following issue needs to be resolved for Windows:\n\n* https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp/issues/1520#issuecomment-1197117564\n* #2534\n* #3176\n\n## 6. Too late\n\nFixed already:\n\n* #3073\n* #2453\n* #3091\n* #2250\n* #74\n* #3138\n* #2297\n* #2570\n* #2208\n* #2054\n* #2049\n* #1631\n* #3201\n* #3193\n* #2641\n* #1391\n* #3230\n",

So, for example, if you're using `blazor.webassembly.js` and you attempt to customize the loading of boot resources like this:\n\n```js\nBlazor.start({\n  webAssembly: {\n    loadBootResource: function (/* ... */) {\n      // ...\n    },\n  },\n});\n```\n\n...then it will just silently \"not work\". This could create a pit of failure for customers who see examples in docs using the `blazor.web.js` options format but are writing a Blazor WebAssembly standalone app, for example.\n\n## Solution\n\nWe should update `blazor.webassembly.js` and `blazor.server.js` to accept the options format used by `blazor.web.js`.\nInclude end-to-end test that will assert that options are passed correctly\n\n**Summary Comment**: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/51611#issuecomment-1866955885\n",

Without loss of generality between circuit and WebAssembly options, something like this should work:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nasync function boot(options?: Partial<WebAssemblyStartOptions>): Promise<void> {\r\n  // ...\r\n  const normalizedOptions = options?.webAssembly ?? options ?? {};\r\n  setWebAssemblyOptions(Promise.resolve(normalizedOptions));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis approach always prioritizes the \"nested\" options over top-level options.

Useful to isolate backfills that targeted a specific data range\n\n- Filter by **Created At**  \n  ??? Helps identify when backfills were initiated (e.g., ad hoc vs. automated)\n\n- Filter by **Completed At**  \n  ??? Enables monitoring of completion lag or stuck backfills\n\n- Filter by **Duration**  \n  ??? Surfaces long-running backfills that may impact system performance\n\n- Filter by **Reprocess Behavior**  \n  ??? Distinguish between missing-only backfills and full-range reprocessing\n\n- Filter by **Max Active Runs**  \n  ??? Useful when diagnosing throttling or concurrency constraints in backfill execution\n\n- Filter by **Status**  \n  ??? Surface failed or incomplete backfills\n\n\n### API Support  \n\n???

Useful for spotting recently completed runs or identifying DAGs that finished during outages or incidents\n\n- Filter by **Duration Range**\n  ??? Identify slow or long-running DAGs to tune performance or spot issues with stuck tasks\n\n- Filter by **DAG Version** and/or **Bundle Version**\n  ??? Correlate failures or behavioral changes with code changes over time\n\n- Filter by **Conf Content**\n  ??? Search for runs where conf contains specific keys or values (e.g., for dynamic configuration or user-specific logic)\n\n- Filter by **Triggered By**\n  ??? Distinguish manual runs, asset-triggered runs, CLI-triggered runs, or other automated triggers; important in hybrid scheduling\n\n- Filter by **Producing Asset**\n  ??? Show runs created as a result of an upstream asset event, useful for event-driven DAGs and lineage debugging\n\n- Filter by **Logical Date ** or **Run After** (Range)\n  ??? Logical Date is the canonical ???execution date??? and is often used for backfill or partitioned logic; ???Run After??? helps with when something is scheduled to run, independent of the logical date\n\n### API Support  \n\n??????

      "description" : "### Description\n\nThere are a number of text transformations that amount to repetitive tasks commonly done by authors. To give one example, if I'm quoting a brief passage that contains quotation marks???\n\n> During this time the  meanings of \"liveness\" and \"presence\" were indistinguishable from Western discourses of modernization.\n\n???I'll need to convert the double-quotes used in the quotation to single-quotes in my paper, like so:\n\n> Lisa Parks argues that \"during this time the  meanings of 'liveness' and 'presence' were indistinguishable from Western discourses of modernization.\"\n\nThis sort of thing can be done by hand or with find-replace (if find-in-region were a thing in Zettlr; see #4040). But it's also the sort of yak shaving/repetitive task that cries out for automation, particularly when using a tool like Zettlr that contains other features of advanced text editors.\n\n### Proposed Changes\n\nMany programming text editors contain a menu or sub-menu from which users can select text transformations that are common in programming, such as changing tabs to spaces, toggling upper and lower case characters, straightening quotes, etc. For instance, BBEdit has a killer `Text` menu:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/caa059ea-7846-462f-8763-fa0e57431161)\n\nI'm suggesting that Zettlr add a similar menu or sub-menu populated with text transformations that are common in academic or journalistic writing. These could include:\n\n- Double quotes to single quotes. (See above.)\n- Single quotes to double quotes.\n- Italics to quotes (e.g., for changing `_Cultures in Orbit_` to `\"Cultures in Orbit\"` to satisfy a different style guide.)\n- Quotes to italics.\n- Join lines (a.k.a. unfill-region, see #4039)\n- Sentence case to title case.\n- Title case to sentence case.\n\n???and possibly others.\n\nPossible locations for these menu items could include the edit menu (or a sub-menu under the edit menu), the right-click context menu when text is selected in the editor, or a top-of-screen toolbar button. Some of the most commonly used transforms might also be given their own keyboard shortcuts.\n\n### Caveats\n\nNone.\n\n### Do you Wish to Attempt Implementing this Yourself?\n\nNo\n\n### Zettlr Version\n\nNightly\n\n### Your Platform\n\n- [ ] Windows\n- [ ] macOS\n- [x] Linux\n\n### Operating System Version\n\nManjaro (Rolling)\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_",

Similarly, text cut and pasted from LaTeX documents will often have pairs of single quotes and/or backticks in place of double-quotes. A transform that converted paired single quotes and paired backticks to double-quotes would come in handy from time to time.\n- Different style guides advise for or against using spaces on either side of emdashes. A transform would make it simple to toggle from one to the other.", "Im gonna add a good first issue label here, because the bulk of the work only involves writing appropriate CodeMirror commands.

I think the older #4039 may also be a sub-issue of this now.", "Good catch, added!", "@richdouglasevans and @nathanlesage ??? As promised, here is a composite PDF from which you can glean text to test the various transforms.\n\nBelow are the representative passages for cutting and pasting. I notice that the cut-and-paste behavior differs somewhat depending on the PDF viewer from which the text is copied to the clipboard. Zotero's on-board PDF viewer, for example, seems to replace line breaks with extra spaces, while other PDF viewers introduce hard wraps for each line of text. In any case, here goes:\n\nThis passage from Lisa Parks' _Cultures in Orbit_ demonstrates #5680 (paired quotes to double quotes):\n\n```\nOur World???s structure established precedents for subsequent\nglobal television coverage, alternating between live views of the television\nstudio, maps, and remote locations, interpellating the viewer not only as\n??????globally present?????? but as ??????culturally worldly?????? and ??????geographically mobile.??????\nSeen by millions of viewers throughout North America and Europe, this\nearly experiment helped to determine one of the cultural forms of satellite\ntelevision.\n```\n\nWhen I paste it from Zotero's PDF viewer, instead of the hard wraps, I get #5679 (duplicate spaces):\n\n```\nOur World???s structure established precedents for subsequent  global television coverage, alternating between live views of the television  studio, maps, and remote locations, interpellating the viewer not only as  ??????globally present?????? but as ??????culturally worldly?????? and ??????geographically mobile.??????  Seen by millions of viewers throughout North America and Europe, this  early experiment helped to determine one of the cultural forms of satellite  television.\n```\n\nThis passage from Evans and Ludgren's _No Heavenly Bodies_ has some wicked hard wraps that could be resolved with #4039 / unfill-region (Zotero again changes these wraps to duplicate spaces):\n\n```\nThe launch of Sputnik and Yuri Gagarin???s flight, of course, ??were impor??tant\nlandmarks of the Space Race and widely considered to be significant victo-\nries for the Soviet ??Union during the Cold War. 2 However, the act of broad-\ncasting Gagarin???s return to Moscow to audiences in Western ?? E\nurope was not\nan example of unidirectional propaganda, but rather a cooperative effort\nby broadcasters in both the Soviet U\n ?? nion and ??Europe.3\n```\n\nThis passage from Patrick Robert Parsons' _Blue Skies_ has more hard wraps, as well as smart quotes, both single and double, to be straightened (#5675). Once straightened, the quotes could also be used to test #5686 (converting between double and single quotes). It also has an emdash with no spaces around it (#5681): \n\n```\nThe consumer could choose from\nthree-inch tubes to ???giant??? twenty-inch screens, as well as direct view pic-\nture tubes or early ???projection screen??? receivers. None of the sets were cheap.\nPrices ranged from $99 to nearly $5,000 for custom-built models.12 The av-\nerage selling price was around $575 in 1947 and, although prices came down\na bit each year, it was still a costly adventure.13 As historians Christopher\nSterling and Michael Kittross noted: ???The typical 5-inch to 7-inch receiver\ncost from $375 to $500 in mid-1948???several weeks??? pay for the average\nworker. \n```\n\nAnd the excerpt of the interview with Whitney Phillips from Nieman Lab contains emdashes that do have spaces around them (#5681):\n\n```\nOur world is awash in mis- and disinformation. Conspiratorial thinking\nand misguided beliefs and attitudes towards science are widespread. But\ncombatting this deluge of problematic information must be done with care.\nToo often, argues Whitney Phillips, we dismiss the people who consume or\npropagate such information as irrational. In fact, given the experiences\nthey may have been having on the internet for many years ??? or what they\nmay have been encountering via traditional media for decades ??? their\nviews, troubling as they may be, may in many cases be perfectly rational.\n```\n\n[TransformExamples.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19493251/TransformExamples.pdf)", "Love it @wideaperture ??????\n\nIt's immediately thrown up stuff \uD83E\uDD73 For example, the excerpt from Evans and Ludgren's _No Heavenly Bodies_ includes some unwanted line breaks... I ran the command in my dev version of Zettlr and they're removed. Sadly, the text has some \"funky\" whitespace that confounds the existing transforms.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c7bff1e-a9f1-475d-a871-a6d8908ecc7b)\n\nThat \"whitespace\" is `SPACE` + `SOFT HYPHEN` ([?](https://www.ascii-code.com/CP1252/173)) + `SPACE`.\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74d612bf-92f4-4a11-ac2f-de86b75e4f54\n\nI'll leave it to you and Hendrik to decide _What_ to do here; perhaps there's a composite transform called `Zap Gremlins` that does a whole bunch of cleanup on a selected block of text:\n\n* remove unwanted line breaks\n* strip duplicate spaces\n* remove any soft hyphens, hairline spaces, that sort of thing\n* more?\n\nIn any case, GREAT! Having real data to work with is fantabulosa ??????", "Thank you, @richdouglasevans! I love the idea of a `Zap Gremlins` option. Another Zettlr-adjacent app, Scrivener, [seems to have this feature](https://forum.literatureandlatte.com/t/what-is-zap-gremlins/44999/2), so some users may already be familiar with it:\n\n> Text Tidying ??? Zap Gremlins Strips Unicode and ASCII control characters from the selection. If you are having difficulties compiling, or have found areas in your text where the cursor seems to get ???stuck??? when moving through ranges of text, your document may have acquired these invisible control characters from somewhere. This command will strip out all of the Unicode characters falling within the range of #x00 to #x1F, save for the necessary #x09, #x0A, #x0C and #X0D characters, which are used to print spaces, line returns, page breaks and tabs in your text.\n\nI haven't used Scrivener in something like 12 years, so I had no idea they had implemented this. It seems, in fact, like we've independently arrived at [nearly all the same features](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/clean-up-your-texts-with-scrivener):\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ecb032c-e896-4f17-a53d-f39ff569010c)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3869737-f59d-42d8-a3e8-dc77cd3813ff)\n\nI think the only (relevant, non-word processor-y) ones not on our list are `Zap Gremlins`, `Strip Leading Tabs/Spaces`, `Make Uppercase`, and `Make Lowercase`.", "@nathanlesage Any sense of when these features might be code-reviewed/merged?

If all goes well I'll implement the other text transforms secure in the knowledge that the approach has been signed-off by Hendrik (and others) and any \"dumb\" first-time contributor stuff is sorted.\n\nIn your comment on that PR you expressed a potential reservation about the approach taken; [you wrote](https://github.com/Zettlr/Zettlr/pull/5701#issuecomment-2772653913):\n\n> I'll have to think if it's really adequate to have the transform commands implemented using a factory style.\n\nThe other twelve or so transforms all use the exact same approach; I am loathe to raise twelve or more PRs only to receive a review comment along the lines of _\"This approach is inadequate.\"_ You know what I mean? :D\n\nMmm \uD83E\uDD14 What I'll do is raise exactly one more PR for another transform so that you can see how the approach works across two distinct transforms. I will action any review comments you leave and, hopefully, PRs for the remaining transforms will flow in quickly with (relatively) minimal review required because the approach has been signed-off.\n\nI'll raise that PR tomorrow and then reply to this conversation with a sorted list of exactly two PRs ??????", "Sounds good!

(Many are one-liners.) They all use the `transformSelectedText` higher-order function which does not change across all 12+ transformations.\n\nEach transformation has unit tests: indeed, the unit test code dwarfs the implementation code.\n\nThere are some outstanding questions around I18N and, I think, around adding these transformation commands to the app's menu somewhere.

Forked and cloned the repository, then searched the codebase for `readline` usage to find the core input handling logic.\n2.  Identified `useKeypress.ts` (for raw keypress events) and `InputPrompt.tsx` (for input logic) as the key files.\n3.  To see what the application receives, I temporarily modified the code to log every keypress event to a `debug.log` file.\n4.  **Key Finding:** My initial debugging proved that on a default macOS Terminal, `Shift+Enter` sends the exact same sequence (`\\r`) as a regular `Enter` press, making the two indistinguishable.\n\n### Attempted Fix & The Final Discovery\n\nBased on the initial finding, I attempted a code-only fix by teaching the application to listen for a different key combination, `Shift+Down`, which often sends a unique sequence on other terminals.\n\n1. The Code I Tested\nI modified `useKeypress.ts` to listen for the `Shift+Down` sequence (`\\x1b[1;2B`) and `InputPrompt.tsx` to handle a `key.shift` flag.\n\n```typescript\n// In useKeypress.ts, I added a check:\nif (key.sequence === '\\x1b[1;2B') {\n  key.name = 'return';\n  key.shift = true;\n}\n```\n```typescript\n// In InputPrompt.tsx, I added the key.shift check:\nif (key.ctrl || key.meta || key.shift || charBefore === '\\\\' || key.paste) {\n  // ... newline logic\n}\n```\n\n2. The Result: It Also Failed\nThis proof-of-concept did not work. To understand why, I used the `cat` command to see what my terminal was actually sending when I pressed `Shift+Down`.\nFinal Proof: The terminal sent `^[[B`, which is the standard escape code for a plain Cursor Down key.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis investigation leads to a definitive conclusion: the default macOS Terminal is more limited than anticipated. It appears to strip the `Shift` modifier information from both the `Enter` key and the arrow keys, making a code-only fix for a `Shift+Key` newline combination unfeasible on this specific platform, although i think this might work on other platforms which by default register shift + down as '\\x1b[1;2B' but i cant really test it.\n\nThis might explain why `Ctrl+J` is a common suggested alternative, as it sends a universal newline character (`\\n`) that doesn't rely on modifier key parsing.\n\nAs this is my first contribution, my analysis could be wrong, and I apologize for the detailed-but-failed attempt. Given these findings, what is the desired path forward? Any information from the internal `b.corp.google.com` link about how other terminals are supported would still be very helpful.\n\nThank you for your time and guidance.", "Just to add, I personally use the Warp Terminal on Mac.

Each emitter implements specific operation from low level OpenVINO dialect.\n\n### Prerequisites\nDue to limited resources, cross compilation is preferred option now for building OpenVINO targeting RISC-V development boards. Please see the documentation [\"Cross compile OpenVINO??? Runtime for RISCV64 systems\"](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/docs/dev/build_riscv64.md) for more details. For this work, you need to build [`xuantie-gnu-toolchain`](https://github.com/XUANTIE-RV/) or [`riscv-gnu-toolchain`](https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain.git) with `QEMU` support for emulation. So you don't need to have RISC-V development board even to contribute to OpenVINO for these platforms \uD83D\uDE03 \n\n### What needs to be done?\n\n* Create `fp32` [Swish](https://docs.openvino.ai/2025/documentation/openvino-ir-format/operation-sets/operation-specs/activation/swish-4.html) operation [JIT Emitter](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/emitters/plugin/riscv64/jit_eltwise_emitters.hpp) for RISCV64 platform with RVV1.0 support. Use OpenVINO [CPU plugin JIT emitters](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/emitters/README.md) documentation and [RISC-V \"V\" Vector Extension](https://github.com/riscvarchive/riscv-v-spec/releases/tag/v1.0) documentation for details.\n* Support your implemented JIT Emitter in the [JIT Executor](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/4ebe493140b90cbaaa68e2c71fe8e1dbd7461822/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/nodes/eltwise.cpp#L805).\n* Modify [RISCV64 kernel](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/4ebe493140b90cbaaa68e2c71fe8e1dbd7461822/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/nodes/kernels/riscv64/jit_uni_eltwise_generic.hpp#L19) (in both places: [create_eltwise_emitter](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/4ebe493140b90cbaaa68e2c71fe8e1dbd7461822/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/nodes/kernels/riscv64/jit_uni_eltwise_generic.cpp#L401) and [get_supported_precisions](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/4ebe493140b90cbaaa68e2c71fe8e1dbd7461822/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/nodes/kernels/riscv64/jit_uni_eltwise_generic.cpp#L528)) to apply developed JIT emitter.\n\nBefore emitter implementation, please, modify tests to be sure that developed functionality is covered by test:\n * Add `jit` kernel check in [activation](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/0a177ff48a7197bee7eeb08f4e81b9d0ce8db271/src/plugins/intel_cpu/tests/functional/custom/single_layer_tests/classes/activation.cpp#L229) test, the test must fail.\n* If test doesn't fail then add supported operation in [CPU activation test instantiation](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/0a177ff48a7197bee7eeb08f4e81b9d0ce8db271/src/plugins/intel_cpu/tests/functional/custom/single_layer_tests/classes/activation.cpp#L263) if it's absent.\n\n### Tests\nTests are disabled in default build, so ensure to add `-DENABLE_TESTS=ON` into cmake command during the project configuration.\n\n[GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest) is used for testing. CPU functional test target is [ov_cpu_func_tests](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/tree/master/src/plugins/intel_cpu/tests/functional). You can use `GoogleTest` filter:\n```sh\n# If you use xuantie-gnu-toolchain:\n<xuantie_install_path>/bin/qemu-riscv64 -cpu rv64,x-v=true,vext_spec=v1.0 ./bin/[platform]/[build_type]/ov_cpu_func_tests --gtest_filter=\"*smoke*Activation*Swish*\"\n\n# If you use riscv-gnu-toolchain:\n<riscv_install_path>/bin/qemu-riscv64 -cpu rv64,v=true,vext_spec=v1.0 ./bin/[platform]/[build_type]/ov_cpu_func_tests --gtest_filter=\"*smoke*Activation*Swish*\"\n```\n\n### Example Pull Requests\n\n* [Abs](https://docs.openvino.ai/2025/documentation/openvino-ir-format/operation-sets/operation-specs/arithmetic/abs-1.html) operation: https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/pull/30218\n\n\n### Resources\n\n- [Contribution guide - start here!](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n- [What is OpenVINO?](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino#what-is-openvino-toolkit)\n- [CPU plugin JIT emitters](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/emitters/README.md)\n- [Blog post on contributing to OpenVINO](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n- [User documentation](https://docs.openvino.ai/)\n- [Intel DevHub Discord channel](https://discord.gg/7pVRxUwdWG) - engage in discussions, ask questions and talk to OpenVINO developers\n- [How to link your Pull Request to an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#manually-linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-the-pull-request-sidebar)\n-  [\"Cross compile OpenVINO???

While the issue is good first issue, I will be glad if some of my doubt can be answered. Thank you. \r\n\r\n1. I was able to figure out that, this component is the one rendering the button  \"???\" https://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/apps/studio/components/interfaces/Auth/Users/UserDropdown.tsx\r\n\r\n2. While doing going through the code base, I was able to detect the code that is rendering the UserDropdown.tsx \r\nhttps://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/apps/studio/components/interfaces/Auth/Users/UsersListItem.tsx \r\n\r\nI noticed it is possible to check if the user is already confirmed from this line \r\nhttps://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/apps/studio/components/interfaces/Auth/Users/UsersListItem.tsx#L29\r\n\r\nI think I can either passed the isUserConfirmed to the UserDropdown.tsx component or create another derive state  inside the UserDropdown.tsx as it is derived from UsersListItem.tsx and then render the text inside https://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/apps/studio/components/interfaces/Auth/Users/UserDropdown.tsx#L160 using the state. \r\n\r\n3. For the two bonuses. I think, I was able to locate the part that renders them\r\nhttps://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/apps/studio/components/interfaces/Auth/AuthTemplatesValidation.tsx \r\n\r\nIf I get the first bonus part, this line https://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/apps/studio/components/interfaces/Auth/AuthTemplatesValidation.tsx#L151 should be  *Password Recovery*\r\n\r\nFor the second bonus, I think using the \"Magic Link\" format is okay. \r\n\r\nThough, I was able to build the project on my local system. I need a little guidance on recognising on how I can get to this pages.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n", "Hi @Hallidayo, I am looking for my open source contribution.\r\nCan I pick this issue?

I think its good to just have the one item displayed so if the user is awaiting an invite the button should be:\r\n\r\n`Send Invite Link`\r\n\r\nIf the user is confirmed then the default button should be displayed:\r\n\r\n`Send Magic Link`\r\n\r\nFor the headings in the Email Templates that is the correct file. Its the `title` key in each object that needs to be checked. Its probably best to uppercase the start of each word so `Invite user` to `Invite User`.\r\n\r\nAre you able to view the Email Templates locally? ", "@Hallidayo, thanks for your reply. I was unable to view the Email Template Locally, I could not figure out the link. \r\n\r\nIs it *Send Invite Link* or *Confirm SignUp Link*. \r\nAlso the user can be checked if already confirmed through  `const isUserConfirmed = user.email_confirmed_at || user.phone_confirmed_at`, in this scenerio, we just havae to check for the `user.email_confirmed_at` ?\r\n", "@Unique-Usman - If you go to http://localhost:8082/project/default/auth/templates you should then get the templates showing for you locally.\r\n\r\nSorry yes it should be Confirm Sign Up Link.\r\n\r\nYeah you should be able to use the `isUserConfirmed` constant to switch between the two items.\r\n\r\nFeel free to reach out if you need anything!", "@Hallidayo, I have a first PR for the resolvement of the issues https://github.com/supabase/supabase/pull/27759, kindly check thank you.

      "description" : "Hi there,\n\nI just wanted to point out a *possible low priority bug.  We recently upgraded our version of ERDDAP to 2.25.1 (axiom/docker-erddap:2.25.1-jdk21-openjdk) and noticed that when de-selecting the time variable in the tabledap > Data Access Form, the \"time\" is removed from the url after generating it but the \"time constraints\" remain in the generated url.  We *think this wasn't the case previously, but it's possible this is expected behavior?  Our assumption was that de-selecting time would remove all time components from the generated url.  We noticed it because we ran into issues with no data being returned due to those time constraints remaining in the url.\n\nAgain, low priority but wanted to point it out in case it is in fact a bug.\n\nThis is the case for Chrome Version 133.0.6943.141 (Official Build) (arm64) on a mac.\n\nA screenshot is attached indicating the issue.\n\nThanks for your time!\n\nBest,\nSam\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f60c9bb4-0d2c-415c-866e-de44c0f9662e)",

But the wording seems to imply that at one point the method was the recommended method, but the method didn't exist before the PR which introduced both it and the comment. \r\n\r\nI am wondering why it wouldn't be a good idea to use this method, seeing as I am already using the GitHubSourceAction in one of my stacks and it is using the owner/repo/branch with the oauthToken as a SecretValue?\r\n\r\n### Links\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/blob/main/packages/%40aws-cdk/pipelines/lib/codepipeline/codepipeline-source.ts#L24",

In my app, I am using CDK version 2 and I have this import:\r\n```\r\nimport { GitHubSourceAction } from \"aws-cdk-lib/aws-codepipeline-actions\";\r\n```\r\nBut that construct has owner, branch, etc as required properties. ~~Where is the construct which is mentioned in the docs above?~~ I see that the \"version 2\" of the `GithubSourceAction` is actually the `CodeStarConnectionsSourceAction`. Is that correct? It seems odd to call the first \"version 1\" and the second \"version 2\".\r\n\r\nEdit: Also I wonder if the recommendation might not be as strong now that Github has [fine-grained personal access tokens](https://github.blog/2022-10-18-introducing-fine-grained-personal-access-tokens-for-github/#:~:text=Fine%2Dgrained%20personal%20access%20tokens%20offer%20enhanced%20security%20to%20developers,your%20data%20of%20compromised%20tokens.&text=Stolen%20and%20compromised%20credentials%20are,data%20breaches%20across%20the%20industry.)?\r\n\r\nEdit: After digging into this, it looks like in order to create a CodeStarConnection, you are forced to create a CodeStarProject. If this is the case then I don't see how the connection can be the preferred method to connect to an existing github repo, like in the case of a bespoke code pipeline or cdk pipeline. Creation of the CodeStarProject ends up creating a repo for you, from what I can tell, which is too heavy-handed of a solution.\r\n", "Yes, CodePipeline's `v1` matches with `GithubSourceAction` while `v2` matches with `CodeStarConnectionsSourceAction`. This is CodePipeline's way of referring to these functionalities, I don't know if I agree with it either\r\n\r\nYou shouldn't be forced to create a project. You should be able to go to the codesuite console (CodeBuild, CodePipeline, etc) and go to settings -> connections to create a connection without any other setup other than what's necessary to link AWS with GitHub\r\n\r\n<img width=\"259\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-12-07 at 1 44 28 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44349620/206304125-eb47a3a1-94a0-41fa-b26c-d99c030e91b0.png\">\r\n", "oh jeez... definitely never noticed that before!

      "description" : "### \uD83D\uDE80 The feature, motivation and pitch\n\nCurrently, we use `_parse_and_validate_*_input` to validate the multi-modal inputs. However, only minimal checks are being made, with some models only checking the type of the inputs. It is easy for the actual shape of the inputs to not match what is being documented in classes like `*ImagePixelInputs`, confusing model developers and maintainers.\n\nTo avoid this, I propose adding a base class `TensorSchema` to validate the model inputs. For example:\n\nOriginal code:\n```py\nclass Phi3VImagePixelInputs(TypedDict):\n    type: Literal[\"pixel_values\"]\n    data: Union[torch.Tensor, List[torch.Tensor]]\n    \"\"\"Shape: `(batch_size * num_images, 1 + num_patches, num_channels, height, width)`\"\"\"\n\n    image_sizes: torch.Tensor\n    \"\"\"Shape: `(batch_size * num_images, 2)`\"\"\"\n```\n\nThe idea:\n```py\nclass Phi3VImagePixelInputs(TensorSchema):\n    \"\"\"\n    Dimensions:\n        - b: Batch size (number of prompts)\n        - n: Number of images\n        - p: Number of patches\n        - h: Height of each patch\n        - w: Width of each patch\n    \"\"\"\n    type: Literal[\"pixel_values\"] = \"pixel_values\"\n    data: Annotated[Union[torch.Tensor, List[torch.Tensor]], TensorShape(\"bn\", \"p\", 3, \"h\", \"w\")]\n    image_sizes: Annotated[Union[torch.Tensor, List[torch.Tensor]], TensorShape(\"bn\", 2)]\n```\n\n- Validation is done automatically, similar to Pydantic models\n  - To avoid performance issues, we should be able to disable validation using a flag\n- We tag each tensor field with `typing_extensions.Annotated` and use the additional metadata to perform validation.\n  - Can switch to `typing.Annotated` once we drop support for Python 3.9\n- Dimensions that are constants can be checked directly\n  - Example: We validate that `data.shape[2] == 3`\n- Dimensions with the same name should be consistent between fields, e.g.\n  - Example: Since `data.shape[0]` and `image_sizes.shape[0]` share the name `bn`, we validate that `data.shape[0] == image_sizes[0]`\n- If a field is a list/tuple instead of a tensor, we use `len` instead of `shape` to check the leading dimension, then recurse into each element of the list to check the remaining dimensions.\n\n### Notes\n\nThis idea can benefit projects outside of vLLM as well, so we should consider developing this as a separate package.\n\n### CC List\n\n@ywang96 @Isotr0py @mgoin \n@hmellor in case this is already a project on HF\n\n### Before submitting a new issue...\n\n- [x] Make sure you already searched for relevant issues, and asked the chatbot living at the bottom right corner of the [documentation page](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/), which can answer lots of frequently asked questions.",

However we need support for validating tensor shapes for the purposes of the RFC, so I'll wait further until that is implemented.", "> Thanks for the update! However we need support for validating tensor shapes for the purposes of the RFC, so I'll wait further until that is implemented.\n\nThe purpose of `huggingface_hub`'s `@strict` decorator ([docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/package_reference/dataclasses)) is to provide other libraries a lightweight framework to build their own validation rules. I believe that you now have everything needed to build shape validators in vLLM without any addition on our side.\n\nHere is a PoC as a starting point. In `shape_utils.py` you can define a `tensor_shape` method that handles per-field validation. Then you need a \"cross-field\" validation to check that e.g. `\"bn\"` is always the same size in all tensors from all fields. This is defined in the `ShapeValidator` mixin class.\n\n```py\n# shape_utils.py\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nfrom typing import Dict, List, Set, Tuple, Union\n\nimport torch\n\nfrom huggingface_hub.dataclasses import as_validated_field\n\n\ndef tensor_shape(*shape: Tuple[Union[int, str]]):\n    \"\"\"\n    Field validator to check the shape of tensors.\n\n    The shape can be a mix of integers and strings. Integers represent fixed dimensions, while strings represent\n    variable dimensions.\n\n    Example: `tensor_shape(3, \"h\", \"w\"))` => 3D tensor with the first dimension fixed to 3. All tensors must have the\n    same size for the second and third dimensions.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    @as_validated_field\n    def validator(value: Union[torch.Tensor, List[torch.Tensor]]):\n        if not isinstance(value, list):\n            value = [value]\n\n        dimensions: Dict[str, int] = {}\n        for tensor in value:\n            if len(tensor.shape) != len(shape):\n                raise ValueError(f\"Expected shape {shape}, but got {tensor.shape}\")\n            for dim, expected in zip(tensor.shape, shape):\n                if isinstance(expected, int) and dim != expected:\n                    raise ValueError(f\"Expected dimension {expected}, but got {dim}\")\n                elif isinstance(expected, str):\n                    if expected not in dimensions:\n                        dimensions[expected] = dim\n                    elif dimensions[expected] != dim:\n                        raise ValueError(\n                            f\"Dimension '{expected}' takes different values: {dimensions[expected]} and {dim}.\"\n                            \" Please check your tensors shapes.\"\n                        )\n\n    return validator(metadata={\"shape\": shape})\n\n\nclass ShapeValidator:\n    \"\"\"\n    A mixin class to validate the shape of tensors in dataclasses.\n\n    To use used in combination with `tensor_shape`, add the `ShapeValidator` class to your dataclass definition.\n\n    While `tensor_shape` checks the shape of each tensor at a field level, `ShapeValidator` checks the consistency\n    of variable dimensions across all fields in the dataclass.\n\n    Example:\n\n    ```python\n    >>> from dataclasses import dataclass\n    >>> from typing import Dict, List, Literal, Set, Tuple, Union\n    >>> import torch\n    >>> from huggingface_hub.dataclasses import strict\n\n    >>> @strict\n    ... @dataclass\n    ... class Phi3VImagePixelInputs(ShapeValidator):\n    ...     data: Union[torch.Tensor, List[torch.Tensor]] = tensor_shape(\"bn\", \"p\", 3, \"h\", \"w\")\n    ...     image_sizes: Union[torch.Tensor, List[torch.Tensor]] = tensor_shape(\"bn\", 2)\n    ```\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def validate_shape_consistency(self):\n        variable_dims: Dict[str, Set] = defaultdict(set)\n\n        # List all fields that have an expected shape\n        for field in self.__dataclass_fields__.values():\n            if \"shape\" in field.metadata:\n                shape = field.metadata[\"shape\"]\n                values = getattr(self, field.name)\n                if not isinstance(values, list):\n                    values = [values]\n\n                # For each field, check the shape of each tensor\n                for value in values:\n                    tensor_shape = value.shape\n\n                    # For each variable dimension, store actual values\n                    for dim, expected in zip(tensor_shape, shape):\n                        if isinstance(expected, str):\n                            variable_dims[expected].add(dim)\n\n        # Check that all variable dimensions are consistent all fields\n        for dim, values in variable_dims.items():\n            if len(values) > 1:\n                raise ValueError(\n                    f\"Dimension '{dim}' takes several values across fields.\"\n                    f\" Found {', '.join(sorted([str(value) for value in values]))}.\"\n                    \" Please check your tensors shapes.\"\n                )\n```\n\nHow to use it? Simply import the two utilities and use them like this:\n\n```py\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom typing import List, Literal, Union\n\nimport torch\n\nfrom huggingface_hub.dataclasses import strict\n\n\n@strict\n@dataclass\nclass Phi3VImagePixelInputs(ShapeValidator):\n    data: Union[torch.Tensor, List[torch.Tensor]] = tensor_shape(\"bn\", \"p\", 3, \"h\", \"w\")\n    image_sizes: Union[torch.Tensor, List[torch.Tensor]] = tensor_shape(\"bn\", 2)\n\n    type: Literal[\"pixel_values\"] = \"pixel_values\"\n```\n\nTensor shapes are now properly validated.

Thank you!", "No one is working on it yet. Thanks for picking this up!", "@DarkLight1337 From the conversation above, I still have some questions (might be dumb questions):\n1. Do we want to use the pydantic solution or pick up this new `@strict` from hugging face?\n2. In the case of picking up `@strict`, we need to use `@dataclass` and ditch `TypedDict`, which will make the class a full class instead of just a dictionary. Are we ok with the potential performance impact?", "1. We want to use `@strict`\n2. Yes, we can change to using dataclasses. The validation part should be opt-in via engine arguments though.", "I'm quite curious about the scope of this PR. From my understanding we need to make this code change on all multi-modal models. So the PR needs to include test results on all changed models. But for now I only have a 8GB GPU that can run models smaller than 3B, like Qwen2-VL-2B and SmolVLM2-2.2B. Do you think there is a way to test the code change with what I have? Or maybe I should focus on these small models, so that people can follow the pattern when they make same code change for those larger models? Thanks!", "Yes, we want this change for all models. You can test locally for a small number of models and let the CI catch the rest.", "Hi all ??? just checking in to see if there???s been any recent progress on this.

Start with\r\n```cpp\r\n    template<class T>\r\n    concept Foo = requires {\r\n        requires { sizeof(T)==0 };\r\n    };\r\n```\r\nClang complains:\r\n```\r\n<source>:3:28: error: expected ';' at end of requirement\r\n    requires { sizeof(T)==0 };\r\n                           ^\r\n                           ;\r\n<source>:3:5: warning: this requires expression will only be checked for syntactic validity; did you intend to place it in a nested requirement? (add another 'requires' before the expression) [-Wrequires-expression]\r\n    requires { sizeof(T)==0 };\r\n    ^\r\n    requires\r\n```\r\nThat is, Clang is suggesting:\r\n```cpp\r\n    template<class T>\r\n    concept Foo = requires {\r\n        requires requires { sizeof(T)==0; };\r\n    };\r\n```\r\n(which, to be clear, ALSO does not do what the user intended!)\r\n\r\nOr, we can throw braces around the whole thing instead, and Clang will be equally satisfied:\r\n```cpp\r\n    template<class T>\r\n    concept Foo = requires {\r\n        { requires { sizeof(T)==0; } };\r\n    };\r\n```\r\nOr, we can \"cancel out\" the two `requires requires` Clang suggested, and Clang will be equally satisfied:\r\n```cpp\r\n    template<class T>\r\n    concept Foo = requires {\r\n        sizeof(T)==0;\r\n    };\r\n```\r\nBasically, I think Clang should continue to complain about all of these. The only way to shut it up should be the universal signal, \"redundant parentheses around the condition.\"\r\n```cpp\r\n    template<class T>\r\n    concept Foo = requires {\r\n        ((sizeof(T)==0));              // OK, I guess\r\n        (requires { sizeof(T)==0; });  // OK, I guess\r\n    };\r\n```\r\nThe current diagnostics seem to be in a sour spot of moral hazard, where Clang seems to be TRYING to help the user-programmer, but actually ignores a lot of equally dangerous alternatives.\r\n\r\nIs Clang clever enough to detect when the condition is guaranteed to be a constant-expression for any `T`? e.g. `sizeof(T)==0` is a constant-expression regardless of `T`, because `sizeof(T)` is integral. When it's a constant expression, I think the likelihood is high that the programmer intended to test truthiness, not well-formedness.\r\n\r\nAlso notice that `sizeof(T)==0` doesn't depend on any requires-expression-parameters; that's an obvious difference between it and e.g. `requires(T t) { sizeof(T)==t; }` (which arguably is clear enough in its intent to test well-formedness instead of truthiness).",

If you would like to work on this issue, your first steps are:\n\n1. Check that no other contributor has already been assigned to this issue. If you believe that no one is actually working on it despite an assignment, ping the person. After one week without a response, the assignee may be changed.\n1. In the comments of this issue, request for it to be assigned to you, or just create a [pull request](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pulls) after following the steps below. [Mention](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) this issue in the description of the pull request.\n1. Fix the issue locally.\n1. [Run the test suite](https://llvm.org/docs/TestingGuide.html#unit-and-regression-tests) locally. Remember that the subdirectories under `test/` create fine-grained testing targets, so you can e.g. use `make check-clang-ast` to only run Clang's AST tests.\n1. Create a Git commit.\n1. Run [`git clang-format HEAD~1`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html#git-integration) to format your changes.\n1.

Start with\r\n```cpp\r\n    template&lt;class T&gt;\r\n    concept Foo = requires {\r\n        requires { sizeof(T)==0 };\r\n    };\r\n```\r\nClang complains:\r\n```\r\n&lt;source&gt;:3:28: error: expected ';' at end of requirement\r\n    requires { sizeof(T)==0 };\r\n                           ^\r\n                           ;\r\n&lt;source&gt;:3:5: warning: this requires expression will only be checked for syntactic validity; did you intend to place it in a nested requirement? (add another 'requires' before the expression) [-Wrequires-expression]\r\n    requires { sizeof(T)==0 };\r\n    ^\r\n    requires\r\n```\r\nThat is, Clang is suggesting:\r\n```cpp\r\n    template&lt;class T&gt;\r\n    concept Foo = requires {\r\n        requires requires { sizeof(T)==0; };\r\n    };\r\n```\r\n(which, to be clear, ALSO does not do what the user intended!)\r\n\r\nOr, we can throw braces around the whole thing instead, and Clang will be equally satisfied:\r\n```cpp\r\n    template&lt;class T&gt;\r\n    concept Foo = requires {\r\n        { requires { sizeof(T)==0; } };\r\n    };\r\n```\r\nOr, we can \"cancel out\" the two `requires requires` Clang suggested, and Clang will be equally satisfied:\r\n```cpp\r\n    template&lt;class T&gt;\r\n    concept Foo = requires {\r\n        sizeof(T)==0;\r\n    };\r\n```\r\nBasically, I think Clang should continue to complain about all of these. The only way to shut it up should be the universal signal, \"redundant parentheses around the condition.\"\r\n```cpp\r\n    template&lt;class T&gt;\r\n    concept Foo = requires {\r\n        ((sizeof(T)==0));              // OK, I guess\r\n        (requires { sizeof(T)==0; });  // OK, I guess\r\n    };\r\n```\r\nThe current diagnostics seem to be in a sour spot of moral hazard, where Clang seems to be TRYING to help the user-programmer, but actually ignores a lot of equally dangerous alternatives.\r\n\r\nIs Clang clever enough to detect when the condition is guaranteed to be a constant-expression for any `T`? e.g. `sizeof(T)==0` is a constant-expression regardless of `T`, because `sizeof(T)` is integral. When it's a constant expression, I think the likelihood is high that the programmer intended to test truthiness, not well-formedness.\r\n\r\nAlso notice that `sizeof(T)==0` doesn't depend on any requires-expression-parameters; that's an obvious difference between it and e.g. `requires(T t) { sizeof(T)==t; }` (which arguably is clear enough in its intent to test well-formedness instead of truthiness).\n</details>\n", "Hey can I pick this up? Im new to the project and just looking for some beginner friendly issues", "I've identified several problems:\n\n1. LLVM should parse this correctly\n2. Since requires { requires { sizeof(T) == 0 }; }; always evaluates to true, the compiler should issue a warning to the user\n\nI'd like to fix this, but it seems too challenging for me. \uD83D\uDE2D" ],

It was done originally to make it feel more \"native app like\", but.. I agree; it does indeed hurt more than help. Also in 2025 most apps are electron wrappers anyways so most \"native apps\" behave more like websites than old school native apps. There's some parts where copying doesn't have the intended side-effect ??? f.e. `v-icon` ??? but generally I agree we should drop this from the global styles \uD83D\uDC4D\uD83C\uDFFB " ],

With the growing adoption of [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), which has boosted venv???s traction even further, I think it might be time to consider dropping Conda support.\n\nThat said, I???d argue that venv is mainly a developer convenience rather than something people would actually use in production. So perhaps we should also consider discussing its removal in the future.\n\n@ashwinb are you ready?\n\n### \uD83D\uDCA1 Why is this needed?

(don't mind the setpersonastate, just wanted to make sure it works)\n\nin the seperate goroutine, we call createDotaLobby function after waiting for 10 seconds before steam client fully initializes (unnecessary)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68573c68-4f42-41b5-b995-506748dd4878)\n\nthere is not much to explain, as we're just initializing the dota2 logger (without it, segfault will happen cause dota2 clients likes to log stuff), initializing the dota2 client itself with our steam client and our dota2 logger, inform steam network that we are now playing the game and finally, we inform the dota2 server that our connection state must be initialized now by SayHello() function.\n\nafter that, we are ready to proceed with creating the lobby object.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c442442-27f2-4d9c-99f2-6b81aed4e54a)\n\nhere, we just declare a bunch of variables and use them in CreateLobby function when creating a lobby. it's that simple.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3219864b-9272-4ced-b030-7440e2abf0c7)\n\nafter that, we are ready to.. wait for another 3 seconds before steam processes our request and invite the members. if you did everything correctly, this is what you will end up with:\n\nby the way, I made a fork of go-dota2 with updated protobufs (as of dota 7.38b).\nuntil (and if) it will be merged into the main repo of go-dota2, feel free to use it as you see fit.\n\nthe original library is now updated and will work with the newest dota version!\nthanks to paralin.\n\nwill be writing a documentation for this library if I will have time\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5732233-ae5b-4176-9c7f-e41d122b3d4e)", "the IP address list is now up to date, and you don't need to regen the protos anymore (they are also up to date). :)", "How safe is something like this to use, in terms of VACBANs, (if we're just automating joining parties etc.)\n\nalso; Can i use this to download replays by getting the salt etc given a matchID?

Please describe.**\n\nHad my Certbot set up to auto-renew certificates that my OpenBao uses for serving incoming requests and to authenticate itself.  That is, the cert-key pair was in two places in the agent config:\n```hcl\nauto_auth {\n  method \"cert\" {\n    config = {\n      name              = \"...\"\n      client_cert       = \"/etc/openbao/agent-fullchain.pem\"\n      client_key        = \"/etc/openbao/agent-privkey.pem\"\n      reload            = true\n    }\n  }\n  sink \"file\" {\n    # ...\n  }\n}\nlistener \"tcp\" {\n  address       = \"[::]:8100\"\n  tls_cert_file = \"/etc/openbao/agent-fullchain.pem\"\n  tls_key_file  = \"/etc/openbao/agent-privkey.pem\"\n  role          = \"metrics_only\"\n}\n```\nCertbot has a post-renewal deploy hook that sends `SIGHUP`.  The listener config seems to be reloaded (subsequent TLS connections to port 8100 shows updated cert) but the TLS auto-auth continues to use the old key/cert.  I noticed this because the main OpenBao server started logging a large number of requests from the agent rejected due to expired client certificate.  The agent was retrying the request in a tight loop.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nIt'd be great if `client_cert` and `client_key` used for the `cert` auto-auth method were also reloaded upon `SIGHUP.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nFor now I changed my renewal hook to restart the service, not just reload.  I would like to avoid having to do this, in order to minimize agent downtime.\n\n**Explain any additional use-cases**\nNone so far.\n\n**Additional context**\nN/A\n",

      "description" : "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\nThe OIDC device flow is a great authentication method to use when the normal browser flow isn't usable, e.g., inside an SSH session, but copying the link to an external browser can be a bit annoying. It would be nice to add a QR code option to the client, which could improve the user experience in such cases.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nIt would be nice to add a \"generateqr=yes\" option to the callbackmode=device to generate a QR that can be scanned by the user's mobile device.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\nIt could be done externally with scripts like this:\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n./bao login -method=oidc callbackmode=device skip_browser=true 2>&1 | while read -r line; do\n    # Output the current line (this will allow the process to still display the login prompts)\n    echo \"$line\"\n\n    # Check if the line contains the URL (regex for URLs)\n    if [[ \"$line\" =~ https?://.+ ]]; then\n        # Extract the URL\n        auth_url=\"${BASH_REMATCH[0]}\"\n\n        # Output the URL\n        echo \"Authorization URL: $auth_url\"\n\n        # Generate the QR code for the URL\n        echo \"Generating QR code for the URL...\"\n        qrencode -t UTF8 \"$auth_url\"  # Displays QR code directly in terminal\n\n        # After generating the QR code, stop further URL extraction (we only need the first URL)\n    fi\ndone\n```\nBut it would be better to implement in the bao binary",

Hence, I like your mindset @roysti10 \n> omit the builder entirely and move the Build method to `ConsensusFollowerImpl`\n\n### What the Consensus Follower _(Micro-)Service_ needs to be \n\nFrom my perspective [bluesign's struct definition](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/issues/7593#issuecomment-3079153956) shows quite nicely what the `ConsensusFollowerImpl` is at its heart: \n* its a self-contained, runnable application \uD83D\uDC49   [`cmd.Node`'s method `Run()`](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/blob/85fd812a7e49c921277160d8d31b2eba0a436a57/cmd/node.go#L22-L26);\n* and it allows subscribing to finalization events that the consensus follower core logic produces, when ingesting the chain. In [bluesign's suggestion](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/issues/7593#issuecomment-3079153956) that's the `pubsub.FollowerDistributor`.\n\nOn the one hand, the `ConsensusFollowerImpl` is supposed to be a stand-alone, self-contained component, so it needs some minimal sub-set of the components that are part of a full node software package. On the other hand, we want to be careful of how much of the \"basic node software\" we are shipping as part of the consensus follower service, because some portion of it will not be needed to run the follower just by itself. In my opinion, the `FollowerServiceBuilder` already encapsulates these needed components quite nicely (and also doesn't create too much other stuff that isn't needed):\nhttps://github.com/onflow/flow-go/blob/2894ca2c6d8686d0395eb86cf0b91f9253b0f29d/follower/follower_builder.go#L93-L116\n\n### Thinking about what changes could look like on a high level\n\nMy impression of [bluesign's suggestion](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/issues/7593#issuecomment-3079153956) is that `cmd.Node` field could be the result of [`FollowerServiceBuilder.Build()`](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/blob/2894ca2c6d8686d0395eb86cf0b91f9253b0f29d/follower/follower_builder.go#L573); similarly to the current code: https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/blob/2894ca2c6d8686d0395eb86cf0b91f9253b0f29d/follower/consensus_follower.go#L219 \n\n**Some context for `OnFinalizedBlock` notifications** (notes also for myself, as I unpack the code structure):\n\nThe Flow protocol defines `OnFinalizedBlock` notifications as follows\nhttps://github.com/onflow/flow-go/blob/927a2ac08e73bc05e283ae5541b7a9c98e48ec0e/consensus/hotstuff/consumer.go#L107-L112\nYour should think a notification as a self-contained package of information, stating that something is true. In our specific case, with a `OnFinalizedBlock` notification, the consensus follower states that \"the given block and all its ancestors are known to be final\". Those notifications / packages of information are distributed in an even-driven manner.  \n\n\n* At the moment, `ConsensusFollowerImpl` exposes a method to subscribe to `OnFinalizedBlock` notifications:\nhttps://github.com/onflow/flow-go/blob/2894ca2c6d8686d0395eb86cf0b91f9253b0f29d/follower/consensus_follower.go#L238-L243 \n* The `OnFinalizedBlock` notifications are produced at the lowest level  by the `Forks` data structure ([here](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/blob/125a77ae16fd1b208d4ab560bda980e63110e32d/consensus/hotstuff/forks/forks.go#L448)). `Forks` is part of the consensus follower's core logic.\n* At construction, a [`hotstuff.FollowerConsumer`](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/blob/125a77ae16fd1b208d4ab560bda980e63110e32d/consensus/hotstuff/forks/forks.go#L20) is [injected  into `Forks`](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/blob/125a77ae16fd1b208d4ab560bda980e63110e32d/consensus/hotstuff/forks/forks.go#L31-L42). By convention, this injected `FollowerConsumer` is an instance of [`FollowerDistributor`](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/blob/2afe79e0d7360acffc30d4bfb1301cbba7a86e44/consensus/hotstuff/notifications/pubsub/distributor.go#L33-L38). The `FollowerServiceBuilder` does this exactly in line 211: https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/blob/2894ca2c6d8686d0395eb86cf0b91f9253b0f29d/follower/follower_builder.go#L206-L216\n\n\nHence, I think with [bluesign's `ConsensusFollowerImpl` struct](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/issues/7593#issuecomment-3079153956), this [code in the `NewConsensusFollower`](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/blob/2894ca2c6d8686d0395eb86cf0b91f9253b0f29d/follower/consensus_follower.go#L207-L224) could be written as follows:\n```golang\n\taccessNodeOptions := getFollowerServiceOptions(config)\n\tanb, err := buildConsensusFollower(accessNodeOptions)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\treturn nil, err\n\t}\n\tpubsubDistributor := anb.FollowerDistributor // will be included in the consensus follower in subsequent build step\n\tfollowerService, err := anb.Build()\n\n\treturn &ConsensusFollowerImpl{\n\t\tNode:                followerService,\n\t\tFollowerDistributor: pubsubDistributor,\n\t}, nil\n```\n\n", "I think there are also simplifications possible in conjunction with the code building on top of the follower service. Ideally, code would be using either the [`FollowerOption`s](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/blob/2894ca2c6d8686d0395eb86cf0b91f9253b0f29d/follower/follower_builder.go#L319-L346) or [`Option`s](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/blob/2894ca2c6d8686d0395eb86cf0b91f9253b0f29d/follower/consensus_follower.go#L52-L102) ... not sure why the difference is. Similarly, we also have two configs [`FollowerServiceConfig`](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/blob/2894ca2c6d8686d0395eb86cf0b91f9253b0f29d/follower/follower_builder.go#L78-L83) and [`Config`](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/blob/2894ca2c6d8686d0395eb86cf0b91f9253b0f29d/follower/consensus_follower.go#L36-L51). I feel we should be able to deprecate one. ", "maybe Rosetta could be using the [FollowerOptions](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/blob/2894ca2c6d8686d0395eb86cf0b91f9253b0f29d/follower/follower_builder.go#L319-L346) and [FollowerServiceConfig](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/blob/2894ca2c6d8686d0395eb86cf0b91f9253b0f29d/follower/follower_builder.go#L78-L83) since the builder seems to be algorithmically the central, more evolved and much better documented software piece  -- I would suggest to retain the builder and deprecate [Options](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/blob/2894ca2c6d8686d0395eb86cf0b91f9253b0f29d/follower/consensus_follower.go#L52-L102) and [Config](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/blob/2894ca2c6d8686d0395eb86cf0b91f9253b0f29d/follower/consensus_follower.go#L36-L51).\n\nThat would be a rosetta change too \nhttps://github.com/onflow/rosetta/blob/6052b6392f65cdda273847150264092faadf8232/state/state.go#L670-L687", "> > Hi [@AlexHentschel](https://github.com/AlexHentschel) . can I pick this up?\n> > From what I understand, we have to move the class to the test packages, do you see it being used anywhere in the future in the production code in itself?\n> \n> Thanks for the contribution [@roysti10](https://github.com/roysti10) !

( basically `FollowerDistributor` provides `AddOnBlockFinalizedConsumer(pubsub.OnBlockFinalizedConsumer)` and `cmd.node` from `Build` provides `Run, Start, Ready, Done` stuff ) \n\n\n", "@bluesign i might be repeating myself but  my question is where would the line ` anb.FollowerDistributor.AddOnBlockFinalizedConsumer(cf.onBlockFinalized) ` be written , i understood making the pubSubDistributor part of the ConsensusFolloweImpl, \n\nDo you mean that the code piece creating the ConsumerFollowerImpl would be incharge of the subscription?, wouldnt this be a significant change for those who use this API?\n\nI see rosetta is already doing that in https://github.com/onflow/rosetta/blob/main/state/state.go#L694 ", "@roysti10 basically, \n\n```golang\ntype ConsensusFollowerImpl struct {\n\tcmd.Node\n\t*pubsub.FollowerDistributor\n}\n```\n\nif you check `pubsub.FollowerDistributor` it is providing the `AddOnBlockFinalizedConsumer` so you don't need to include that. `ConsumerFollowerImpl` will use the `AddOnBlockFinalizedConsumer` from `FollowerDistributor` \n\n", "Understood thanks, let me implement this, hopefully can get a PR by Monday\n@AlexHentschel please assign the issue to me " ],

This field should allow uploading a `.webp` image, similarly to the implementation in the \"reward\" step. Upon upload, the image should be sent to the specified endpoint, and the Image URL field should be automatically populated with the uploaded image's URL. The uploaded image should be named using the format `<quest_id>_banner`.\n\n## Proposed Actions \uD83D\uDEE0???\n\nHere???s a checklist of actions to follow for resolving this issue:\n\n1. **Fork and Create Branch**:\n   Fork the repository and create a new branch using the issue number:\n\n```bash\n   git checkout -b fix-[issue-number]\n```\n\n2. **Implement Changes**:\n\n* [ ] Identify the \"banner\" step component in the admin dashboard.\n* [ ] Add a file input field next to the existing Image URL input, similar to the one used in the \"reward\" step.\n* [ ] Implement the image upload logic using the endpoint:\n\n  ```rust\n  https://github.com/lfglabs-dev/api.starknet.quest/blob/testnet/src/endpoints/admin/upload_image.rs\n  ```\n* [ ] Name the uploaded image using `<quest_id>_banner`.\n* [ ] On successful upload, auto-fill the Image URL field with the returned URL of the uploaded image.\n* [ ] Ensure the uploaded file type is restricted to `.webp`.\n\n3. **Run Tests and Commit Changes**:\n   Make sure your changes don't break existing functionality and commit with a clear message:\n\n```bash\n   git commit -m \"Fix: Add banner image upload in quest creation/editing\"\n```\n\n## Required \uD83D\uDCCB\n\nTo keep our workflow smooth, please make sure you follow these guidelines:\n\n* **Assignment**: Don't create a pull request if you weren???t assigned to this issue.\n* **Timeframe**: Complete the task within **3 business days**.\n* **Closing the Issue**: In your PR description, close the issue by writing Close #\\[issue\\_id].\n* **Review Process**:\n\n  * Once you've submitted your PR, change the label to **\"ready for review\"**.\n  * If changes are requested, address them and then update the label back to **\"ready for review\"** once done.\n* **Testing**: Test your PR locally before pushing, and verify that tests and build are working after pushing.\n\nThank you for your contribution \uD83D\uDE4F\n\n?????? WARNING: Failure to follow the requirements above may result in being added to the OnlyDust blacklist, affecting your ability to receive future rewards.\n",

Make a Draft PR then that i would test, to ensure it didnt break any existing feature or units. Once ready, I make the PR ready for review. So i'd like to work on this :)", "Hey! I???d be excited to work on. this\n\nAs a frontend developer with a few years of experience, I???ve worked on several admin dashboards and complex form flows, so I???m super comfortable with tasks like adding file inputs, handling uploads, auto-filling fields, and keeping things reusable and consistent across steps.\n\nthanks for your consideration", "Hi!\n\nI???d like to take on this task. I???ve reviewed the implementation in the \"reward\" step and feel confident replicating the same logic for the \"banner\" step. I???ll make sure to add the file input field, handle .webp uploads using the provided endpoint, and format the filename as <quest_id>_banner. Once uploaded, the image URL will be populated automatically as requested.\n\nI???ll ensure the UI remains consistent and test everything locally to maintain stability. Let me know if I can proceed.\n\nThanks!", "Hi my name is John, I am an experienced fullstack developer with over 4 years of experience.

      "description" : "### Package\n\nNone\n\n### Is your feature request related to a problem?\n\nCan we improve the output or formatting of these self-diagnostic logs to make troubleshooting much more efficient? \n\nHas anyone tried to troubleshoot the SDK yet? I got involved on an issue where someone's web app was not feeding information to Live Metrics. I turned on [SDK Logging](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/tree/main/src/OpenTelemetry#troubleshooting) built into OTel, to collect the self-diagnostics output while they opened up a browser and navigated to Live Metrics blade. I'm starting to read through the output file to decipher what processing is going on within the SDK and when I first load the log file I get this experience in VSCode, where each line is a composite format string: \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d9142ff-4cec-4ed8-96ae-5fc4bac65a26)\n\nI'm clearly interested in reading, reviewing and comprehending the three SDK entries highlighted in red above, but the string output just shows me the raw unformatted string with each place holder. Let's extract that SDK log entry on line 299 here: \n\n```\n2025-02-11T23:04:06.0983783Z:Transmission failed. StatusCode: {0}. Error from Ingestion: {1}. Action: {2}. Origin: {3}. AAD Enabled: {4}. Instrumentation Key: {5}. Configured Endpoint: {6}. Actual Endpoint: {7}{0}{(To get exact error change LogLevel to Verbose)}{Telemetry is stored offline for retry}{AzureMonitorMetricExporter}{False}{1226a108-1d56-4bc7-9aea-c04d04904833}{https://eastus2-0.in.applicationinsights.azure.com/}{eastus2-0.in.applicationinsights.azure.com}\n```\n\nWhen I read the output string of that log entry I see that we have 8 placeholder values that I need to mentally replace, my eyes cannot easily distinguish which text is part of which placeholder so instead of reading this line like a normal person, I have to spend a few minutes or even open up notepad and try to slowly piece together... \"ok, so {0} needs to get replaced with '(to get exact error change LogLevel to Verbose)', or was I supposed to replace that first {0} place holder with '0\", lets skip that for now, let's assume {1} is the placeholder that should get  '(to get exact error change LogLevel to Verbose)', then would 'Action: {2}' become 'Action: Telemetry is stored offline for retry'? \n\nJust trying to decipher or eye-ball this one entry alone is a challenge, when we could just have the SDK write out the formatted string with the values already replaced into the placeholder slots.\n\n### What is the expected behavior?\n\nInstead of line 299 of that sample log reading like this:\n\n_2025-02-11T23:04:06.0983783Z:Transmission failed. StatusCode: {0}. Error from Ingestion: {1}. Action: {2}. Origin: {3}. AAD Enabled: {4}. Instrumentation Key: {5}. Configured Endpoint: {6}. Actual Endpoint: {7}{0}{(To get exact error change LogLevel to Verbose)}{Telemetry is stored offline for retry}{AzureMonitorMetricExporter}{False}{1226a108-1d56-4bc7-9aea-c04d04904833}{https://eastus2-0.in.applicationinsights.azure.com/}{eastus2-0.in.applicationinsights.azure.com}_\n\nI'd like to see it written like this in the resulting log file: \n\n_2025-02-11T23:04:06.0983783Z:Transmission failed. StatusCode: 0. Error from Ingestion: (To get exact error change LogLevel to Verbose). Action: Telemetry is stored offline for retry. Origin: AzureMonitorMetricExporter. AAD Enabled: False. Instrumentation Key: 1226a108-1d56-4bc7-9aea-c04d04904833. Configured Endpoint: https://eastus2-0.in.applicationinsights.azure.com/. Actual Endpoint: eastus2-0.in.applicationinsights.azure.com_\n\n\n### Which alternative solutions or features have you considered?\n\nCan we add a new feature to the open telemetry SDK that would allow for better logging output that is more readable and allows people troubleshooting missing data symptoms to more easily identify what is going on within the SDK at the time of missing data? \n\nNot sure the best feature implementation, maybe as an additional setting the SDK [self-diagnostic logging](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/tree/main/src/OpenTelemetry#troubleshooting) enablement? Should we just add another setting that would help output more readable logs? \n\nHow about another configurable setting called '**OutputFormat**', or '**OutputStyle**' or just '**Format**'? If omitted, the resulting log file sticks with this weird composite formatted string, but if that configurable value is changed to '**ResolvePlaceholders**' or '**Readable**' or '**Interpolated**', then the SDK will go ahead and replace each placeholder with the string value automatically before writing to the log? \n\n{\n    \"LogDirectory\": \".\",\n    \"FileSize\": 32768,\n    \"LogLevel\": \"Warning\",\n    **\"Format\": \"Interpolated\"**\n}\n\nSo maybe this \"Format\" setting defaults to \"Composite\", as I'm sure some users have taken a dependency on this format type already, then add an alternative value of \"Interpolated\" if you want those placeholders replaced with their string values in the output log file? \n\nThoughts? \n\n### Additional context\n\nI have real world dropped, delayed or duplicate telemetry problems that I need to solve. When that investigation takes me to the SDK and how the records were produced, I don't want to have to do mental interpolation just to figure out what the failure was or what the SDK was doing at that moment in time.

Issue?????????????????????????????????:???\n- [x] Please do not modify this template :) and fill in all the required fields.\n\n### 1. Is this request related to a challenge you're experiencing? Tell me about your story.\n\nI'm using Dify to build a chatflow with streaming output. My current chatflow uses two LLM nodes:\n\n-   DeepSeek-R1: Generates a thinking process, wrapped in `<think>` HTML tags.\n-   Gemini: Generates the final answer.\n\nThe DeepSeek-R1 node adds the following HTML prefix to its streaming output:\n\n```html\n<details style=\"color:gray;background-color: #f8f8f8;padding: 8px;border-radius: 4px;\" open> <summary> Thinking... </summary>\n```\n\nWhen accessing the chatflow via the API, I need to receive the streaming output *without* this HTML prefix. However, if I try to filter the output using a code node (e.g., with regular expressions/python scripts), it breaks the streaming ??? I have to wait for the entire response before processing it.\n\n### 2.

It looks like handle_command_do_gimbal_manager_pitchyaw in AP_Mount already makes use of the gimbal ID field. Should the ROI handling (set_roi_target) also use the same gimbal selection logic as handle_command_do_gimbal_manager_pitchyaw?\nI'd appreciate any guidance you can provide.", "Hi @G1-k, thanks for looking into this.  yes, I think the do-set-roi-location and do-set-roi-none should consume the gimbal id field in the same way as do-gimbal-manage-pitchyaw handler.  thanks!", "Hello @rmackay9 \nThis is my first contribution and I have added and tested this feature.

If you have a model with a filename like:\n\nMy_Axolotl_Model.bgcode\n\n...and you upload it to PrusaLink, it appears with that filename. But if you download it, PrusaLink sends it with the filename:\n\nMYAXOL~1.BGC\n\n...which, of course, is the 8.3-character truncated filename for older file systems like FAT16.\n\nThere's no reason why PrusaLink can't send the file with its full and original filename, which is obviously retained after uploading because it appears correctly in the PrusaLink file store for the printer.\n\n### How to reproduce\n\nUpload a file with a filename that exceeds the 8.3 format. Download the same file and observe its filename.\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe file should be transmitted by PrusaLink with its full and original filename.\n\n### Files\n\n_No response_",

      "description" : "### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nRight now, Supabase Realtime does not support multiple filters. If used, the live provider for supabase will send an invalid filter payload, causing the realtime request to fail.\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create any realtime resource\r\n2. Add more than 1 filter to the resource (I was using a useList hook with multiple objects in the filters option)\r\n3. Watch websocket network requests, it will show an error.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI think we should either log a warning if we see multiple filters, or naively take the first one? \r\n\r\n### Packages\r\n\r\n- supabase realtime v2.30.34 (not latest, but also not fixed in latest)\r\n- @refinedev/supabase 5.9.4\r\n\r\n### Additional Context\r\n\r\nSee here for Refine's implementation, where it is joining each filter with a comma. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/refinedev/refine/blame/8be95d808ae2f3f280ebd015bd95eb04238fe463/packages/supabase/src/liveProvider/index.ts#L67\r\n\r\nSee here for feature that is being discussed.

We believe this approach is correct. What do you think?", "My workaround for now was picking one filter that did 90% of the server side filtering then did the rest on the client side. So you're saying that you will remove the filtering altogether?", "> My workaround for now was picking one filter that did 90% of the server side filtering then did the rest on the client side. So you're saying that you will remove the filtering altogether?\r\n\r\n\r\nI was wrong. [In this use case](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/discussions/6366), the filters must work. We'll investigate [this issue](https://github.com/supabase/realtime-js/issues/97) and see what we can do.\r\n\r\nWe're currently considering showing a warning when multiple filters are used and allowing users to override the `liveProvider`'s filters using the `meta.realtimeFilters` prop.\r\n", "I've also bumped [an issue](https://github.com/supabase/realtime/issues/486#issuecomment-2371379197) directly inside supabase/realtime to see what the status is there.", "Until there are any updates in the supabase side, we should have this working without an error. Picking the first filter will work for many cases but it must be configurable (like `meta.realtimeFilter`). When working with multiple filters, realtime subscription may log a warning (like @alicanerdurmaz stated) about the current issue and say that only the first filter is picked etc.\r\n\r\nIf Supabase starts supporting multiple filters in the future, we can just deprecate the `realtimeFilter` and revert back to the current state \uD83E\uDD14 \r\n\r\nMaybe @alicanerdurmaz can provide a detailed description for the implementation we want and it will be a guide for anyone interested in working on this issue \uD83D\uDE80 \uD83D\uDE80 ", "@amerryma @aliemir \r\n\r\nI think it would be good to warn if there is more than one filter and allow the user to override the filter if needed. \r\n\r\n1. **Warning for Multiple Filters**  \r\n   If more than one filter is used, show a warning to user. If `meta.realtimeFilter` is available, use that instead of `params.filter`.\r\n   [Code Link](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/blame/8be95d808ae2f3f280ebd015bd95eb04238fe463/packages/supabase/src/liveProvider/index.ts#L67)\r\n\r\n2. **Fix Filter Syntax Errors**  \r\n   There are some syntax errors in the generated filter. These need to be fixed and tested.\r\n\r\n3. **Skip Unsupported Filters**  \r\n   Some filters that work in Refine don't work with Supabase Realtime. Ignore those filters when generating for Realtime.  \r\n   [Supabase Realtime Docs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/postgres-changes)\r\n", "Hey! \r\nI want to work on this issue.", "Hello @raja8287, thanks for improving Refine, we are open to all contributions \uD83D\uDE4C", "Hi, is it still open?

Understanding the Basics of Crypto Wallets\r\n>    Types of wallets (custodial vs. non-custodial, hot vs. cold).\r\n>    Key features and functionalities.\r\n\r\nWhat would be the content here? how does this contribute to the goal of the article? (we should consider the reader will know these basic differences already)\r\n \r\n> 2. Key Design Principles for a Crypto Wallet Interface\r\n>    Simplicity, accessibility, and security considerations.\r\n\r\nThis isn't wrong, but is very nuanced in this context. Be careful here when writing the content and consider that too simple UI often lacks appropriate amount of guidance for users (which results in poor usability as novice users do not know what to do and the UI doesnt help them, classic example is wallet \"receive\" screen design with a simple big QR code, acc address and no other information what to do).\r\n\r\nSimilarly some wallets in the name of security force people to only write down recovery phrase without providing other options that are deemed \"less secure\" resulting in a situation where people arent ready for this level of commitment and are being forced into something they do not feel comfortable doing at that point. \r\n\r\n> 3. Practical Steps for Designing a Crypto Wallet Interface\r\n>    User research, wireframing, prototyping, and iterative design.\r\n\r\n- This sounds like a separate article on a design process in general, why should it be part of specific wallet design article?\r\n\r\n> 4. Common UX Issues in Crypto Wallets and How to Avoid Them\r\n>    Complex onboarding, confusing terminology, poor error handling.\r\n\r\nlooking good :) hope to see some examples \r\n\r\n> 5.

      "comments" : [ "Wondering if it makes sense to convert some of these. Specifically the two I added:\n- `GetStructField`: DataFusion has a similar `get_field` already we could use, but it operates by field name instead of index, so it has to find the right field by name for each batch which adds some overhead, which is some of the downside it seems to the UDFs over logical and physical expressions which can optimize these cases at analysis time. Implementing a custom ScalarUDF also doesn't really make sense because as a user you would never select a nested field by index, always by name.\n- `GetArrayStructFields`: There's no equivalent DataFusion expression AFAIK, but the same thing above applies where there's not really a use cases for using this function directly, Spark just creates this at analysis time from an `ExtractValue` operation", "@Kimahriman what you say makes sense. For `GetStructField` and `GetArrayStructFields` it may not be useful to convert to ScalarUDFImpl", "One limitation of trying to switch from PhysicalExpr to ScalarUDFImpl I faced  - is lack of capability extract the batch size. That is why it won't work for non-determenistic functions. Though, those functions are tightly coupled with spark runtime, so I doubt they are worth being included into the datafusion-spark crate.

Updates to rollout rules (or segments) often do not trigger immediate cache invalidation, so changes like setting a rollout to 100% may not be reflected until the cache entry expires. This is because the system avoids complex dependency tracking for cache eviction and instead relies on periodic TTL-based eviction for most evaluation results. See details in [this PR](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt/pull/954).\n\nIf you need changes to take effect immediately, you can temporarily disable the cache or reduce the TTL as a workaround. The underlying issue is that the update flow for rollout rules may not be calling the cache invalidation routine (`DeleteFlag`) as expected, which is likely the root cause of the stale evaluations you???re seeing.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

There is a race condition between\n\n`BleManager.isPeripheralConnected(peripheralId)`\n\nand\n\n`BleManager.disconnect(peripheralId)`\n\nwhere `isPeripheralConnected` returns `true` for a little bit after the event listener for `disconnect` fires. I've only tested it on Android.\n\n**To Reproduce**\n\n```typescript\nconst disconnectCallback = async ({ peripheral, status, domain, code }: BleDisconnectPeripheralEvent) => {\n    const isConnected = await BleManager.isPeripheralConnected(peripheralId)\n    // logs \"isConnected true\"\n    console.log('isConnected', isConnected)\n})\n\nBleManager.onDisconnectPeripheral(disconnectCallback)\n\n// await BleManager.disconnect(peripheralId, false) also has the race condition\nawait BleManager.disconnect(peripheralId)\n```\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\n`isPeripheralConnected` should return `false`\n\n**Smartphone (please complete the following information):**\n\nAndroid 15+ devices\n\n**Additional context**\n\nI believe the issue is in `Peripheral.java`. The thread on:\n\nhttps://github.com/innoveit/react-native-ble-manager/blob/4ac49e9825820a4836f4fcbcab85f2f3d6cee93a/android/src/main/java/it/innove/Peripheral.java#L162-L163\n\nis likely competing with the sync function call:\n\nhttps://github.com/innoveit/react-native-ble-manager/blob/4ac49e9825820a4836f4fcbcab85f2f3d6cee93a/android/src/main/java/it/innove/Peripheral.java#L280-L282\n\nour workaround currently is...\n\n```typescript\nconst maxTries = 10\nconst delayMs = 500\nfor (let tries = 0; tries < maxTries; tries++) {\n    const stillConnected = await BleManager.isPeripheralConnected(peripheralId)\n    if (!stillConnected) return true\n\n    console.debug(`Still connected, retrying (${tries + 1}/${maxTries})`)\n    await sleep(delayMs)\n}\n```\n",

      "description" : "### Review Mojo's priorities\n\n- [x] I have read the [roadmap and priorities](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/roadmap.html#overall-priorities) and I believe this request falls within the priorities.\n\n### What is your request?\n\nThe BitSet collection currently implements union, intersection and difference. Of the common mathematical set operations we are only missing [conjugation](https://www.probabilitycourse.com/chapter1/1_2_2_set_operations.php) a.ka. all not. \n\n### What is your motivation for this change?\n\nConjugation is essentially just a not on all values in the BitSet. Having an efficient standard implementation of this common operation would help any programmer using the collection to do boolean algebra.\n\nCompleting the set notation would be valuable for anyone implementing mathematical code in set theory or boolean algebra. \n\n### Any other details?\nConjugation and all not is only the same in the region the BitSet covers. \nA BitSet with the values 1001 should return a result BitSet with the values 0110 when all_not is called.\nI would be happy to provide a draft implementation if you think this would be a good addition.\n\n### Mathematical accuracy\nIf we want true conjugation we would need to implement the following:\nIf we want to make a conjugation that is more faithful to the possibly infinite nature of sets in mathematics we can have a struct which has an internal Bitset of things that are not in the conjugation. Then if we have a Conjugation of A, let us call it Ac, would return true if the value is set to zero in the BitSet A or if it is outside the range of the BitSet A. \n\nThe union of two such conjugations Ac ??? Bc would lead to a conjugation where the new inner BitSet is just the intersection A ??? B. \nThe intersection of two such conjugations Ac ??? Bc would lead to a conjugation where the new inner BitSet is just the union A???B. \nThe difference between conjugations Ac-Bc would lead to a conjugation where the new inner BitSet is just the difference B-A. \nThe conjugation of a conjugation Ac is just the BitSet A.\n\nThe intersection of a conjugation and a BitSet Ac ??? B would lead to a BitSet that is the difference B-A. \nThe difference between conjugation and a BitSet Ac-B would lead to a conjugation where the new inner BitSet is just the difference  A ??? B, and if it is the other way around A-Bc then it result in the BitSet A???B. \nThe union of a conjugation and a bitset Ac ??? B would lead to a conjugation where the new inner BitSet is just the difference A-B.\n \nNeedless to say this is a more complicated proposal than the simpler version and may be better suited to a set manipulation library.

However, in some layouts an outline outside the `<video>` element could be obscured; adding `outline-offset: -2px;` would position the outline over the element.\n\n### Step-by-step reproduction instructions\n\n1.

      "description" : "## Feature Description\n\nStarting in #10165 it was proposed to refactor several methods that hook into the `googlesitekit_inline_modules_data` filter, so they are consolidated into a single method `get_inline_data` that will return all data in the single method.\n\nFor consistency, we should do this in all modules, and preferably enforce this as with an interface. We can create `Module_With_Inline_data` interface that will force adding `get_inline_data` method, and new trait `Module_With_Inline_Data_Trait` that will include `register_inline_data` method, which will hook into the `googlesitekit_inline_modules_data` filter and invoke `get_inline_data` method.\n\nWe can then refactor all modules to use this new interface and trait, and it should be used in all new modules that are created in the future.\n\n---------------\n\n_Do not alter or remove anything below. The following sections will be managed by moderators only._\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n\n* New interface `Module_With_Inline_Data` is introduced to enforce the presence of a unified method on any module that provides inline data.\n* New trait `Module_With_Inline_Data_Trait` is introduced to include a registration method - which will hook into the `googlesitekit_inline_modules_data` and use the interface enforced method as a callback\n* Existing modules with inline data should be refactored to use the interface and trait for consistency.\n\n## Implementation Brief\n\n* [x] Add new interface `includes/Core/Modules/Module_With_Inline_Data.php` \n  *  It should enforce `get_inline_data` method which should return an array\n* [x] Add new trait `includes/Core/Modules/Module_With_Inline_Data_Trait.php`\n  * Include  `register_inline_data` method which hooks into the `googlesitekit_inline_modules_data` and uses `get_inline_data` as a callback\n* [x] Update following modules: \n  * `includes/Modules/Analytics_4.php`\n  * `includes/Modules/Ads.php`\n  * `includes/Modules/Sign_In_With_Google.php`\n    * Each should implement `Module_With_Inline_Data` interface and use `Module_With_Inline_Data_Trait` trait\n    * Refactor existing callback for `googlesitekit_inline_modules_data` hook to use new method `get_inline_data`\n    * In the `register` method, invoke `register_inline_data`\n* Search through codebase if any new module was added in the meantime which is also using the inline data, after this IB was written\n\n### Test Coverage\n\n* Update tests for updated modules to adapt the new method name usage\n\n## QA Brief\n\n* Smoke test the affected modules: \"Analytics 4\", \"Ads\" and \"Sign in with Google\" to make sure the refactor didn't cause any regressions\n\n## Changelog entry\n\n* N/A.\n",

I've assigned it back to you in Execution to add the QAB.", "@techanvil Done! Thanks for letting me know.", "Thanks @abdelmalekkkkk. The PR for the issue is good and I've gone ahead and merged it - congrats on your first merge!\n\nThat said - the current QAB is a bit too broad in scope; there's a lot of functionality associated with the Ads, Analytics and Sign in with Google modules, and QA engineers could spend time smoke testing unnecessary areas (or, more likely would ask you to advise them what they should be focusing on).\n\nTo make the QAB more specific, we should focus on the specific areas of functionality that the refactored code relates to, i.e. the functionality that depends on the pieces of inline data being present.\n\nTo identify these areas, I'd suggest searching for GitHub issues which mention the data keys, e.g. searching for [`supportedConversionEvents`](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Agoogle%2Fsite-kit-wp+supportedConversionEvents&type=issues), and use these issues and their QABs for smoke testing suggestions. Alternatively, use IDE tooling to help identify PRs and their linked issues (for example I use GitLens in Cursor/VS Code, although this [doesn't seem available](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZedEditor/comments/1b5q3dl/switched_to_zed_and_missing_gitlens/) for Zed).\n\nSimply linking to these issues with the direction to run through their QABs should suffice, rather than reproducing the QABs in this issue.\n\nThis is admittedly a bit fiddly as, despite the refactor itself being pretty straightforward, giving it a proper test means delving into some complex areas of functionality.

This is a non-allocating placement new, in which case (per that defect resolution) no additional space may be requested.\n\nSo I think these \"array overhead\" warnings are *always* false-positives. However, they do seem to have been added in May 2020:\nhttps://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blame/1c541aa9f9a2453324724bfb9d661bc672778d10/clang/lib/StaticAnalyzer/Checkers/CheckPlacementNew.cpp#L120-L134 shows it came in with https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/7c3768495e8c1599dc30986f7bd47d5e91f303f2 and https://reviews.llvm.org/D76996\nThat dates this first being added to clang **after** that DR had been reported, voted on, and the resolution accepted into CD5. So I don't think they are simply outdated; maybe the author/reviewers were unaware of the defect report?\n\nOr maybe I'm misunderstanding something and this really is buggy code - \"I'm wrong\" is certainly possible too :-)\n\n",

If you would like to work on this issue, your first steps are:\n\n1. Check that no other contributor is working on this issue. If someone is assigned to the issue or claimed to be working on it, ping the person. After one week without a response, the assignee may be changed.\n1. Leave a comment indicating that you are working on the issue, or just create a [pull request](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pulls) after following the steps below. [Mention](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) this issue in the description of the pull request.\n1. Fix the issue locally.\n1. [Run the test suite](https://llvm.org/docs/TestingGuide.html#unit-and-regression-tests) locally. Remember that the subdirectories under `test/` create fine-grained testing targets, so you can e.g. use `make check-clang-analysis` to only run Clang's Static Analyzer tests.\n1. Create a Git commit.\n1. Run [`git clang-format HEAD~1`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html#git-integration) to format your changes.\n1. Open a [pull request](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pulls) to the [upstream repository](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project) on GitHub. Detailed instructions can be found [in GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

      "comments" : [ "Hi @gozen59 \n\nThanks for raising this issue. Can you specify a bit more what you mean by \"dynamic for each endpoint\"? \n\nAs of today, delay has a default value per operation. For example, `GET /pets` can have a default delay set to 50ms and `POST /pets` a default delay set to 100ms. You also have the ability to override this value per request by specifying a `delay` parameter in the endpoint URI. For example, you can call `GET /pets?delay=200` and this time it will take 200ms to respond.\n\nFrom what I read in #1597, it looks like you're looking for some randomness regarding this delay to simulate things more realistically. Is that correct? And #1597 would be another way of specifying a per-request value (instead of the `?delay=` param? Still correct?\n\nIn case my reading is correct and you're looking for some randomness, what would you think of adding an additional `delay strategy` field next to the existing `delay`? As an example, we could have:\n* delay: `100`\n* delay strategy: `random-20`\nand the applied delay would be a random value in the 80-120 range (100 + or - 20%)\n\nThis could allow us to have a flexible approach and define some more advanced computations (using mean, percentile, etc).\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n", "Hi @lbroudoux ,\n\nYes, I was thinking of something simpler, a bit like the [Uniform_Random_Timer](https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/component_reference.html#Uniform_Random_Timer) component in Jmeter: \n - a Random Delay Maximum (Maximum random number of milliseconds to pause.)\n - and Constant Delay (like the actual delay, Number of milliseconds to pause in addition to the random delay.) ", "This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity :sleeping:\n\nIt will be closed in 30 days if no further activity occurs. To unstale this issue, add a comment with a detailed explanation. \n\nThere can be many reasons why some specific issue has no activity. The most probable cause is lack of time, not lack of interest. Microcks is a Cloud Native Computing Foundation project not owned by a single for-profit company. It is a community-driven initiative ruled under [open governance model](https://github.com/microcks/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). \n\nLet us figure out together how to push this issue forward. Connect with us through [one of many communication channels](https://microcks.io/community/) we established here.\n\nThank you for your patience :heart:", "[Uniform_Random_Timer](https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/component_reference.html#Uniform_Random_Timer) could be a strategy on its own. \n\nWe could have these different cases and strategies:\n\n### Fixed delay (as of today) \n\n* delay: `100`\n* delay strategy: `null` or `fixed`\n\n> Applies a delay of 100ms\n\n### Uniform random delay\n\n* delay: `100`\n* delay strategy: `random`\n\n> Applies a uniform random delay in ms in the 0-100 range\n\n### Ranged random delay\n\n* delay: `100`\n* delay strategy: `random-20`\n\n> Applies a random delay in ms in the 80-120 range (100 + or - 20%) \n\n\nWhat do you think @gozen59? Would that be a good start?", "This could be a good first issue for a wannabe contributor. Let me know if you're interested in some initial guidance!", "Hi  @lbroudoux  ,\n\nSorry for the delay.\nI really like this \"**Ranged random delay**\" strategy :)\n\nThanks & regards", "Postponing this one to `1.13.0` as we'll not be able to put it into `1.12.1`. Sorry!" ],

This is because the footer is not sticking to the bottom, but is attached to the end of the content. \n\n### To Reproduce\n\n1. Go to nightly.decidim.org/onefkjenfrekjfnc (or any page that does not exist)\n2. See error\n\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI expect the footer to be at the bottom of the page. If that would lead to too much empty space in the content, then I would expect the empty space at the bottom to be the same color as the footer.\n\n### Screenshots\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/377f2cd5-82dd-4418-bdc7-d0d2340252f2)\n\n### Stacktrace\n\n_No response_\n\n### Extra data\n\n- Device: MacBook Pro\n- Device OS: MacOs\n- Browser: Safari, Firefox, Chrome\n- Decidim Version: 0.28-0.31dev\n- Decidim installation: nightly, but observed on every platform with the redesign\n\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

(We might choose not to run in the background when the user is on mobile data and is using QSS, to save battery, but that's another issue!) \n\nA user can trigger the dialog asking them to allow background battery use, but we need to prompt the user to do this. \n\nWe could do this with a notification in the settings, or with a prompt on first run. \n\n\"Would you like to enable background battery usage? This will make your notifications more reliable, and improve reliability for others in your community.\"\n\nOne thing that's tricky about this is that it's a global setting for Quiet, not a setting specific to any one community. We might need to make some section for global settings within the community settings. Or it could be another settings area in the community switcher... but this might be confusing. ",

App Launch\n\t???\tThe user opens the app for the first time.\n\n2. Request **Background Activity** Permission\n\t???\tThe app explains why background activity is needed (e.g., for reliable notifications or syncing).\n\t???\tThe user is prompted to grant permission for Background Activity.\n\n3. Detect **Battery Optimization**\n\t???\tThe app checks if Battery Optimization is enabled for it.\n\t???\tIf enabled, the app explains why disabling it is important (e.g., for consistent notifications).\n\n4. Request to Disable Battery Optimization\n\t???\tThe app directs the user to the system settings to disable Battery Optimization for the app.\n\t???\tThe user makes the change and returns to the app.\n\n\nIs the requirement for both concepts? Are we only doing this on Android?\n\n", "@holmesworcester this is ready for review.\n\nI shared some thoughts/questions above ???. We'll need to make some decisions and then I can do another pass to clean it up.\n\nSome of my questions at this point:\n1. Is this only for Android? (iPhone has similar, but not the same, concepts with Background App Refresh and Low Power Mode)\n2. Should we consider the Background Activity/Data permission on Android too?\n\nResearch and explorations in the [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/vX86VHWl2nv8WLo1CyDwLn/Background-Battery-Use?node-id=13-37&t=R13Ko8gyN8Zz1fYc-4)\n", "Yes, let's consider the background activity/data permission.

I'm not sure of a good way to find out, as Android isn't my wheelhouse.

Currently, this specific model is not mentioned in the documentation as a supported model.\n\nHowever, PR-Agent/Qodo Merge supports a wide variety of models through LiteLLM. To add support for a new model like KIMI K2, you would need to:\n\n1. Check if the model is supported by LiteLLM (the underlying library used by PR-Agent)\n2. If supported, configure it as a custom model using the custom model configuration options\n3. Set the appropriate environment variables as required by LiteLLM for that specific model\n\nFor custom models, you can configure them by:\n- Setting `model=\"custom_model_name\"` in your configuration\n- Setting `custom_model_max_tokens` for the model's token limit\n- Adding the required environment variables as specified in the LiteLLM documentation\n\nYou should check the LiteLLM documentation at https://litellm.vercel.app/docs/proxy/quick_start#supported-llms to see if KIMI K2 is supported and what environment variables are needed.\n\n#### Relevant Sources:\n\n> - https://qodo-merge-docs.qodo.ai//usage-guide/changing_a_model#custom-models\n> - https://qodo-merge-docs.qodo.ai//usage-guide/changing_a_model#changing-a-model-in-pr-agent\n" ],

      "description" : "### Context\n\n[JIT Emitters](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/emitters/README.md) are part of code generation feature (a.k.a. tensor compiler) that automatically produces highly-efficient optimized fused subgraph binary code. Each emitter implements specific operation from low level OpenVINO dialect.\n\n### Prerequisites\nDue to limited resources, cross compilation is preferred option now for building OpenVINO targeting RISC-V development boards. Please see the documentation [\"Cross compile OpenVINO??? Runtime for RISCV64 systems\"](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/docs/dev/build_riscv64.md) for more details. For this work, you need to build [`xuantie-gnu-toolchain`](https://github.com/XUANTIE-RV/) or [`riscv-gnu-toolchain`](https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain.git) with `QEMU` support for emulation. So you don't need to have RISC-V development board even to contribute to OpenVINO for these platforms \uD83D\uDE03 \n\n### What needs to be done?\n\n* Create `fp32` [LogicalOr](https://docs.openvino.ai/2025/documentation/openvino-ir-format/operation-sets/operation-specs/logical/logical-or-1.html) operation [JIT Emitter](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/emitters/plugin/riscv64/jit_eltwise_emitters.hpp) for RISCV64 platform with RVV1.0 support. Use OpenVINO [CPU plugin JIT emitters](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/emitters/README.md) documentation and [RISC-V \"V\" Vector Extension](https://github.com/riscvarchive/riscv-v-spec/releases/tag/v1.0) documentation for details.\n* Support your implemented JIT Emitter in the [JIT Executor](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/4ebe493140b90cbaaa68e2c71fe8e1dbd7461822/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/nodes/eltwise.cpp#L805).\n* Modify [RISCV64 kernel](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/4ebe493140b90cbaaa68e2c71fe8e1dbd7461822/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/nodes/kernels/riscv64/jit_uni_eltwise_generic.hpp#L19) (in both places: [create_eltwise_emitter](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/4ebe493140b90cbaaa68e2c71fe8e1dbd7461822/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/nodes/kernels/riscv64/jit_uni_eltwise_generic.cpp#L401) and [get_supported_precisions](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/4ebe493140b90cbaaa68e2c71fe8e1dbd7461822/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/nodes/kernels/riscv64/jit_uni_eltwise_generic.cpp#L528)) to apply developed JIT emitter.\n\n### Tests\nTests are disabled in default build, so ensure to add `-DENABLE_TESTS=ON` into cmake command during the project configuration.\n\n[GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest) is used for testing. CPU functional test target is [ov_cpu_func_tests](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/tree/master/src/plugins/intel_cpu/tests/functional). You can use `GoogleTest` filter:\n```sh\n# If you use xuantie-gnu-toolchain:\n<xuantie_install_path>/bin/qemu-riscv64 -cpu rv64,x-v=true,vext_spec=v1.0 ./bin/[platform]/[build_type]/ov_cpu_func_tests --gtest_filter=\"*smoke*Logical*LogicalOr*\"\n\n# If you use riscv-gnu-toolchain:\n<riscv_install_path>/bin/qemu-riscv64 -cpu rv64,v=true,vext_spec=v1.0 ./bin/[platform]/[build_type]/ov_cpu_func_tests --gtest_filter=\"*smoke*Logical*LogicalOr*\"\n```\n\n### Example Pull Requests\n\n* [Abs](https://docs.openvino.ai/2025/documentation/openvino-ir-format/operation-sets/operation-specs/arithmetic/abs-1.html) operation: https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/pull/30218\n\n\n### Resources\n\n- [Contribution guide - start here!](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n- [What is OpenVINO?](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino#what-is-openvino-toolkit)\n- [CPU plugin JIT emitters](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/emitters/README.md)\n- [Blog post on contributing to OpenVINO](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n- [User documentation](https://docs.openvino.ai/)\n- [Intel DevHub Discord channel](https://discord.gg/7pVRxUwdWG) - engage in discussions, ask questions and talk to OpenVINO developers\n- [How to link your Pull Request to an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#manually-linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-the-pull-request-sidebar)\n-  [\"Cross compile OpenVINO???

This breaks Pydantic validation and causes all tools to disappear from the Tools page.\n\nTo fix it, check your tool metadata (YAML files for built-in tools, or database entries for custom/API tools) and make sure every i18n object has a valid, non-null string for `en_US`???even an empty string is acceptable. After correcting any missing or null values, restart your backend.\n\nRecent changes to i18n files in Dify 1.6.0 may have introduced this issue, so it's worth reviewing any recent updates to your tool definitions or translations as well??[cite](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/21459).\n\nIf you have a lot of tools, consider writing a quick script to scan for missing or null `en_US` fields in your tool configs before restarting. This should resolve the validation error and restore the Tools page.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

This was done so that we don't need to modify the solver to accept an extra command-line argument (we want to keep the solvers intact).\r\n\r\nIf there is no problem with the current setup, I propose that we also change the CalculiX adapter to look for one YAML file per participant, instead of accessing [a common file for all the participants](https://github.com/precice/tutorials/blob/master/CHT/heat_exchanger/buoyantSimpleFoam-CalculiX/config.yml).

It's just extra noise for everyone subscribed to this issue.\n* Subscribe to receive notifications on status change and new comments.\n\n---\n\n## Feature request\n\nMaybe this was already discussed during the dashboard design, but I couldn't find it.\n\nWith the new dashboard we have now \"Start meeting\", which allows us to create an \"instant meeting\", that is automatically deleted after 1 day by default. This option is _only_ available on the dashboard. So to start an instant meeting while in a conversation, one first has to drop to the dashboard to then create the meeting. (and understand, that the option is only there)\n\nI think we should consider adding this option to the \"add\" menu as well, so it is reachable even outside the dashboard.",

The typical rationale is that people want to avoid wasted work in the event that someone else ends up working the issue. However, this practice is not effective in open source, as it often leads to \"issue squatting\", in which an individual asks to be assigned, is granted their request, and then never ends up working on the issue. Accordingly, you are encouraged to communicate your intent to address this issue, ideally by providing a rough outline as to how you plan to address the issue or asking clarifying questions, but, at the end of the day, we will take running code and rough consensus in order to move forward quickly.\n2.  **We have a very high bar for contributions.** We have very high standards for contributions and expect all contributions???whether new features, tests, or documentation???to be rigorous, thorough, and complete. Once a pull request is merged into stdlib, that contribution immediately becomes the collective responsibility of all maintainers of stdlib. When we merge code into stdlib, we are saying that we, the maintainers, commit to reviewing subsequent changes and making bugfixes to the code. Hence, in order to ensure future maintainability, this naturally leads to a higher standard of contribution.\n\nBefore working on this issue and opening a pull request, please read the project's [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md). These guidelines and the associated [development guide](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/docs/contributing/development.md) provide important information, including links to stdlib's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), license policy, and steps for setting up your local development environment.\n\nTo reiterate, we **strongly** encourage you to refer to our contributing guides **before** beginning work on this issue. Failure to follow our guidelines significantly decreases the likelihood that you'll successfully contribute to stdlib and may result in automatic closure of a pull request without review.\n\nSetting up your local development environment is a critical first step, as doing so ensures that automated development processes for linting, license verification, and unit testing can run prior to authoring commits and pushing changes. If you would prefer to avoid manual setup, we provide pre-configured [development containers](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/tree/develop/.devcontainer) for use locally or in GitHub Codespaces.\n\nWe place a high value on consistency throughout the stdlib codebase. We encourage you to closely examine other packages in stdlib and attempt to emulate the practices and conventions found therein.\n\n-   If you are attempting to contribute a new package, sometimes the best approach is to simply copy the contents of an existing package and then modify the minimum amount necessary to implement the feature (e.g., changing descriptions, parameter names, and implementation).\n-   If you are contributing tests, find a package implementing a similar feature and emulate the tests of that package.\n-   If you are updating documentation, examine several similar packages and emulate the content, style, and prose of those packages.\n\nIn short, the more effort you put in to ensure that your contribution looks and feels like stdlib???including variables names, bracket spacing, line breaks, etc???the more likely that your contribution will be reviewed and ultimately accepted. We encourage you to closely study the codebase **before** beginning work on this issue.\n\n:sparkles: Thank you again for your interest in stdlib, and we look forward to reviewing your future contributions. :sparkles:\n" ],

      "description" : "**Describe the bug**\nStarting with Meilisearch v1.15.1, the web interface becomes inaccessible via HTTPS when using locally-issued certificates (mkcert). The SSL connection fails with different error messages across browsers, suggesting a regression in SSL certificate handling.\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n1. Install mkcert and generate local SSL certificates:\n   ```bash\n   mkcert -install\n   mkcert localhost 127.0.0.1\n   ```\n2. Start Meilisearch v1.15.1 with SSL configuration:\n   ```bash\n   meilisearch --ssl-cert-path localhost+1.pem --ssl-key-path localhost+1-key.pem\n   ```\n3. Open browser and navigate to `https://localhost:8443/`\n4. See connection error\n\n**Expected behavior**\nThe Meilisearch web interface should load successfully over HTTPS, as it did in previous versions (v1.15.0 and earlier).\n\n**Screenshots**\nError messages observed:\n\n**Chrome:**\n```\nThis site can't be reached\nThe webpage at https://localhost:8443/ might be temporarily down or it may have moved permanently to a new web address.\nERR_FAILED\n```\n\n**Firefox:**\n```\nAn error occurred during a connection to localhost:8443. The response from the OCSP server was corrupted or improperly formed.\nError code: SEC_ERROR_OCSP_MALFORMED_RESPONSE\n```\n\n**Meilisearch version:**\nv1.15.1\n\n**Additional context**\n- **Architecture:** x86_64\n- **OS:** Linux Mint 22.1\n- **Browsers:** Chrome, Firefox\n- **Certificate type:** mkcert-generated local development certificates\n- **Working versions:** v1.15.0 and earlier\n- **Suspected cause:** This issue appears to be related to PR #5471 \"Support EC private key as SSL certificate\" which modified SSL certificate handling logic in v1.15.1\n\nThe problem specifically affects locally-generated certificates (mkcert) and may be related to changes in how different certificate types (RSA vs EC) are processed. The OCSP-related error in Firefox suggests the new SSL implementation may have issues with certificate validation or OCSP handling for development certificates.\n\n**Workaround:** Downgrading to Meilisearch v1.15.0 resolves the issue temporarily.",

Would it be helpful for me to reproduce the panic using the provided YAML and test @orfeas-k???s potential fix, focusing on validating the new error message?\n2. Should I propose a test case in the KServe test suite (e.g., under test/) to ensure the controller rejects invalid configurations with a clear, actionable error?\n3. Are there preferred validation patterns or error message formats for the fix in hpa_reconciler.go?\n4. How can I best coordinate with @orfeas-k to assist with implementation or testing without overlapping efforts?\n\nI???ve set up a KServe development environment with Kubernetes and am prepared to reproduce the issue, test proposed fixes, or contribute validation logic.

Thank you for supporting contributions to KServe!", "#### Minimal reproduction of error\nI reproduced using the [KEDA example](https://kserve.github.io/website/latest/modelserving/autoscaling/keda/autoscaling_keda/#create-inferenceservice) but\n1. removed `serving.kserve.io/autoscalerClass`\n2. replaced the `metrics` field with one similar to this example\n\t```\n      metrics:\n        - type: External\n          external:\n            metric:\n              backend: \"prometheus\"\n            target:\n              type: Value\n              value: \"2\"\n\t```\n\n#### Why it's happening\nMy understanding is:\n1. There is no `serving.kserve.io/autoscalerClass` annotation set, thus it assumes the default one in\n\thttps://github.com/kserve/kserve/blob/47f30145d2edfedb288224e8f0235877f695f44d/pkg/controller/v1beta1/inferenceservice/reconcilers/autoscaler/autoscaler_reconciler.go#L75-L83, which is HPA\n\thttps://github.com/kserve/kserve/blob/47f30145d2edfedb288224e8f0235877f695f44d/pkg/constants/constants.go#L185-L191\n2. It runs the HPAReconciler\n\thttps://github.com/kserve/kserve/blob/47f30145d2edfedb288224e8f0235877f695f44d/pkg/controller/v1beta1/inferenceservice/reconcilers/autoscaler/autoscaler_reconciler.go#L91\n\nGiven that (but please confirm) using HPA as the default `autoscalerClass` is expected, the failure comes from the fact that getHPAMetrics tries to iterate the `metric.Resource.Name` but there is no such field.\n\nhttps://github.com/kserve/kserve/blob/d20d4228a8b2956b800ad5a3e62c0578b5a5b97f/pkg/controller/v1beta1/inferenceservice/reconcilers/hpa/hpa_reconciler.go#L62\n\n\nThus, does the validation mentioned above refers to validating the `metrics` during HPA creation and more specifically during getHPAmetrics? If so, what should we validate it against? Which are the expected fields for `autoscalerClassHPA`? I noticed that the HPA reconciler also runs for `external` autoscalerClass\nhttps://github.com/kserve/kserve/blob/d20d4228a8b2956b800ad5a3e62c0578b5a5b97f/pkg/controller/v1beta1/inferenceservice/reconcilers/autoscaler/autoscaler_reconciler.go#L93-L95. My current guess is that we 'd need to only confirm there is a `metric.Resource.Name`.\ncc @pierDipi \n\n", "Hi @shhubhxm, I just got back to this bug. I think this is a pretty trivial bug (if my understanding from above is correct) and thus fixing and writing a test won't be too involved. It will be a bit hard to collaborate on that.

We can  -\n- Improve the existing User Guides in the Project wiki\n- Incrementally add explanatory code comments which can be read by docs generators later\n    - Looking for a good prompt that does this job well\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nDevelopers have to refer to the provided samples to learn how to use each of the flags present in our template/evaluation schemas\n\n- Websites like deepwiki provide AI generated documentation(cool stuff) - https://deepwiki.com/Udayraj123/OMRChecker\n- Similarly there's gitdiagram, checkout more [here](https://forgithub.com/)\n\n**Additional context**\nWe are also planning to move it into a dedicated docs/pages folder in future. Also exploring using docs generators like Docusaurus for more elaborate project and code documentation.\n\n> Need help with extensively documenting the usage of template schema in dev branch which introduces a few more Pre Processors - I have already added a basic readme in each of the folders in `samples/experimental` but need someone to refine those for a wider audience.\n> Another help is needed in giving more examples of cases where thresholding configuration is needed for OMRChecker to work with high accuracy.\n\nYou can use this as a reference for a starting point too -\nhttps://deepwiki.com/Udayraj123/OMRChecker\nNote: please share your queries and approaches on discord for quicker discussions:\n- Link to the [Discord invite](https://discord.gg/qFv2Vqf)\n- Link to the [Hacktoberfest 2024 channel](https://discord.com/channels/590134763784896514/1284801897714155613/1284802010549321770)\n",

Docs are crucial for a good adoption of the OMRChecker and I hope you'll be able to help them improve. Please go through the current wiki and share which part of it you'd like to work on.", "@Udayraj123 we can improve documentation by following steps\r\n\r\n1. We need to improve explained comments in every program and module.\r\n2. After that we need to improve 2 instructions manuals , one for normal user and other for devs. \r\n3. The dev manual need to have working of project , which program does what. by this solving other issues will be very easy since file can be found/ accessed more easily and direct references to the files can be given.\r\n4. LLMs like GPT can help with all these. I have done this thing in my earlier project too which can be accessed [here](https://github.com/offline-keshav/Amazon_ML_Challenge) and it did it very efficiently though there were some changes that need to be made.\r\n\r\nAlso I would like to work on this issue since.", "This is awesome. I'm assigning the task to you. Let me know if you need any clarification. Let's do it file by file I suppose. One more pointer is the schema/code differences in dev vs master branch.

I'll assign the task to you and you can host sample docs in your fork of the OMRChecker repository. Based on how it looks we can proceed with any review changes if required", "thank you @Udayraj123 . As more code gets pushed into it, I would like to add a feature where you could go this application and ask the AI to refine or comment where necessary and later maybe you can look at it and review the changes. If that's the case, I will ask to enter google api studio key as their new model gemini 2.0 flash model has upto 1M tokens for free daily. I can add other options for LLM app keys as well. Let me know what do you think about this?", "Sure, we can discuss more on that later.

I'd appreciate if you could share the documentation output on OMRChecker using the PR you created. \n\n Can you please share a sample somewhere in this PR or as an attachment?\n\nAlso we need to discuss and figure out how the documentation should update progressively on updating the source code(via new PRs)", "@Udayraj123 I would like to help contribute to documenting the project with an LLM, what files would you need help with?\n", "@SM9276 I apologize, missed replying earlier.

I am beginning to check out frappe and from what I could dig out, `save_to_db` is triggered during site migrations. Is there any other time this happens? Is migration a periodic thing here and where could I read/find more about this in the docs?\r\n\r\nFor __point. 1__, What I understand from the issue is record_count limit is not required here:\r\n```python3\r\n\r\ndef save_to_db():\r\n\tqueue_keys = frappe.cache.get_keys(queue_prefix)\r\n\tfor key in queue_keys:\r\n\t\t...\r\n\t\twhile frappe.cache.llen(queue_key) > 0 and record_count <= 500:\r\n```\r\n\r\n>  leads to starvation when you're pushing records in higher volumes. We could easily just let the job flush as many records as it can instead?\r\n\r\nIn this case, all records could be bulk retrieved:\r\n\r\n```python3\r\ncache_size = frappe.cache.llen(key) \r\npipe  = frappe.cache.pipeline()\r\npipe.range(key, 0, cache_size - 1)\r\npipe.ltrim(key, cache_size, -1)\r\nrecords, success? = pipe.execute()\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not sure why this is designed this way since to no effect, `insert_record(record, doctype)` should work regardless:\r\n```python3\r\n\r\n\t\t\tif isinstance(records, dict):\r\n\t\t\t\trecord_count += 1\r\n\t\t\t\tinsert_record(records, doctype)\r\n\t\t\t\tcontinue\r\n\t\t\tfor record in records:\r\n\t\t\t\trecord_count += 1\r\n\t\t\t\tinsert_record(record, doctype)\r\n```\r\n\r\nin which case my proposal is something along these lines. chime into remark:\r\n```python3\r\n\r\ndef get_cached_records_from_key(key) -> List[\"Documents\" | dict] | None:\r\n     cache_size = frappe.cache.llen(key) \r\n     pipe  = frappe.cache.pipeline()\r\n     pipe.range(key, 0, cache_size - 1)\r\n     pipe.ltrim(key, cache_size, -1)\r\n     records, success? = pipe.execute()\r\n     if success?:\r\n        return records\r\n     # do something else\r\n\r\ndef save_to_db():\r\n\tqueue_keys = frappe.cache.get_keys(queue_prefix)\r\n\tfor key in queue_keys:\r\n\t\trecord_count = 0\r\n\t\tqueue_key = get_key_name(key)\r\n\t\tdoctype = get_doctype_name(key)\r\n                if records := get_cached_records_from_key(key):\r\n                    insert_many_records(records, doctype)\r\n\r\ndef insert_many_records(records, doctype) -> None:\r\n    for record in records:\r\n        record.update(dict(doctype=doctype))\r\n    # not sure why frappe.get_docs is executed first.

Using frappe.cache is a bad idea for a lot of code that we have.\r\n\r\nHowever, I cannot associate the context here with the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo summarize:\r\n- Some context on migration periodic runs would be helpful.\r\n- Can we get multiple doctype records in a list and then insert in bulk as proposed above?\r\n- Out of scope, but still something to reflect late on: In the above operation, Is `save_to_db` a blocking call and when does it happen? If so, could this be decoupled and made non blocking?\r\n\r\nLet me know what do you think.", "> Some context on migration periodic runs would be help\n\nI've updated a PR for this.\nI'd like to: \n1. know when is this feature triggered \n2.

I have setup RBAC in the gke cluster to give that iam account permissions using the method shown here https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/role-based-access-control#rolebinding. However, when running GKEStartJobOperator it seems to call the GKE cluster with the unqiue id of the service account in the impersonation chain rather than the email. This causes the RBAC to fail as it cant match the User. It works if i put the unqiue id directly as a user subject.\n\n### What you think should happen instead?\n\nThe follow error happens `User \\???<unique_id>\\??? cannot create resource \\\"jobs\\\" in API group \\\"batch\\\" in the namespace \\\"airflow-jobs\\\": requires one of [\\\"container.jobs.create\\\"] permission(s).` I expected it to use the email in the impersonation chain rather than the unique id.\n\n### How to reproduce\n\n1. set up rbac as follows\n```\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nkind: Role\nmetadata:\n  namespace: airflow-jobs\n  name: job-creator\nrules:\n  - apiGroups: [ \"batch\" ]\n    resources: [ \"jobs\", ]\n    verbs: [ \"create\" , \"list\", \"get\", \"update\", \"patch\", \"delete\"]\n  - apiGroups: [ \"batch\" ]\n    resources: [ \"jobs/status\" ]\n    verbs: [ \"get\" ]\n  - apiGroups: [ \"\" ]\n    resources: [ \"pods\" ]\n    verbs: [ \"list\", \"get\"]\n---\nkind: RoleBinding\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nmetadata:\n  name: job-creator-binding\n  namespace: airflow-jobs\nsubjects:\n  - kind: User\n    name: <iam-service-account>\n    namespace: airflow-jobs\nroleRef:\n  kind: Role\n  name: job-creator\n  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io\n```\n2.  create a dag with operator configure with impersonation chain\n```\njob_task = GKEStartJobOperator(\n        task_id=\"job_task\",\n        project_id=???<project-id>,\n        location=\"europe-west1\",\n        cluster_name=???<gke-cluster-name>???,\n        namespace=\"airflow-jobs\",\n        image=\"perl:5.34.0\",\n        cmds=[\"perl\", \"-Mbignum=bpi\", \"-wle\", \"print bpi(2000)\"],\n        name=\"test-job\",\n        ttl_seconds_after_finished=60,\n        wait_until_job_complete=True,\n        deferrable=True,\n        impersonation_chain=???<iam service account>???,\n    )\n```\n\n### Operating System\n\nlinux\n\n### Versions of Apache Airflow Providers\n\napache-airflow==2.10.5+composer\napache-airflow-providers-apache-beam==6.0.4\napache-airflow-providers-celery==3.10.0\napache-airflow-providers-cncf-kubernetes==10.1.0\napache-airflow-providers-common-compat==1.6.0\napache-airflow-providers-common-io==1.5.4\napache-airflow-providers-common-sql==1.26.0\napache-airflow-providers-dbt-cloud==4.3.3\napache-airflow-providers-fab==1.5.3\napache-airflow-providers-ftp==3.12.3\napache-airflow-providers-google==15.1.0\napache-airflow-providers-hashicorp==4.1.1\napache-airflow-providers-http==5.2.2\napache-airflow-providers-imap==3.8.3\napache-airflow-providers-mysql==6.2.2\napache-airflow-providers-openlineage==2.2.0\napache-airflow-providers-postgres==6.1.3\napache-airflow-providers-redis==4.0.2\napache-airflow-providers-sendgrid==4.0.1\napache-airflow-providers-smtp==2.0.3\napache-airflow-providers-sqlite==4.0.2\napache-airflow-providers-ssh==4.0.1\napache-airflow-providers-standard==1.0.0\n\n### Deployment\n\nGoogle Cloud Composer\n\n### Deployment details\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Are you willing to submit PR?\n\n- [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n",

My suggestion would be to do this as a test that fails on a mismatch and an optional command \"print fixes\" or so that outputs the correct things.\r\n\r\nI don't want to interfere with any one else cleaning up these things (@li-roy ?), but I'd be happy to have a go at fixing all the docs.", "So I put a prototype regenerator/tester for torch/_torch_docs.py that could be a base for [test/test_docs.py](https://github.com/t-vi/pytorch/blob/docstring_regeneration/test/test_docs.py).\r\nIt has two modes, one testing torch docstrings (but not with exitcodes yet) and one where it outputs a new torch/_torch_docs.py to stdout.\r\nIt uses astor and autopep8 as dependencies and probably runs best on python3.\r\nThe would be generated documentation is at [torch/_torch_docs.py](https://github.com/t-vi/pytorch/blob/docstring_regeneration/torch/_torch_docs.py).\r\n", "Can I take this up?", "@Jaisu-1 as far as I can see, no one else is presently working on it.\r\nWhen I looked at it (see the links above) it was quite a mess to parse the docstrings, but I'm sure that can be done in a better way, too.\r\nNote that there might be some synergy with the test of the type hint file which grabs the code from docstrings https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/test/test_type_hints.py#L19 .

The following sections will be managed by moderators only._\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n\n* Reader Revenue Management module is referencing the `isURLUsingHTTPS` util function from `assets/js/util/is-url-using-https.js` instead of the local one located in the `assets/js/modules/reader-revenue-manager/utils/validation.js`\n* `isURLUsingHTTPS` function is removed from `assets/js/modules/reader-revenue-manager/utils/validation.js` file\n\n## QA Brief\n\n1. In following files update the import path for `isURLUsingHTTPS`.\n  - assets/js/modules/reader-revenue-manager/index.js\n  - assets/js/modules/reader-revenue-manager/utils/validation.test.js\n\n2. Remove `isURLUsingHTTPS` from `assets/js/modules/reader-revenue-manager/utils/validation.js` file.\n\n### Test coverage\n\nNo additional test change required.\n\n## QA Brief\n\n* <!-- One or more bullet points for how to test that the feature works as expected. -->\n\n## Changelog entry\n\n* <!-- One sentence summarizing the PR, to be used in the changelog. -->\n",

Thank you!", "### Guidance on Completing Issue\n\nHello,\n\nI am currently working on this issue with @juliusalberto  and I'm a bit stuck. Specifically, I need help with the following:\n\n1. **Finding where JabRef handles tab key events**:\n   - I am not sure which part of the codebase is responsible for handling the tab key navigation within the Entry Editor. Could you provide guidance on where I should look for the relevant logic? (e.g., which file or class deals with tab key handling or keyboard navigation?)\n   \n2. **Implementing the tab key behavior**:\n   - Once I locate the correct file, where would it be best to add the logic that moves focus to the next tab when pressing `Tab` in the last field of a tab? Should this be handled as part of an existing focus traversal policy, or would I need to implement a custom listener?\n\nAny pointers or advice on these two points would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThank you for your help.", "We do not know. Create a minimal JavaFX application with two tabs and check how it works there. Then port this knowledge to JabRef.", "### JavaFX Key Handling and Focus Issue\n\nHello,\n\nAfter exploring the codebase, I???ve learned how to check if a `TextField` in a `Tab` is the last one, and how to shift the focus to the next tab. However, I???ve encountered an issue with how JavaFX handles key events when a `TextField` is focused.\n\nFor example, if I create a listener for a `TextField` or even the `EntryEditor`, the listener won't execute while the `TextField` is in focus, as the `TextField` consumes the input before it reaches the listener/handler. This issue is currently evident with the `setupKeyBindings` function, which is intended to initialize shortcuts for navigating the entry editor. Only the \"Ctrl + MINUS\" key seems to work due to what I think is JavaFX handling key inputs before `setupKeyBindings` can.\n\nI???ve tried using `addEventFilter` instead of `addEventHandler`, but the result is the same. I???ve also explored using JavaFX???s `tabIndex` and focus priority logic to control the order of focus between tabs and fields. So that pressing \"tab\" will cycle through all of the specified components in order. However, since the `Tab` class doesn???t have built-in `tabIndex` or `focusTraversal` properties, this has proven to be quite a challenge.\n\nI???m unsure how to proceed or where I should be focusing my efforts. Any suggestions or guidance would be greatly appreciated thankyou.\n", "> I???m unsure how to proceed or where I should be focusing my efforts. Any suggestions or guidance would be greatly appreciated thankyou.\n\n1. Create a minimal JavaFX application showing the issue. Even smaller application than https://github.com/Siedlerchr/javafxreproducer.\n2. Publish the JavaFX application in a repository on GitHub.\n3. Ask question on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).\n4. Post the link to the stackoverflow question here.\n\n---\n\nYour text did not include a link to `org.jabref.gui.fieldeditors.FieldEditorFX#establishBinding`. Did you see this method? \n\n\n```java\n    if (keyBindingRepository.matches(e, {key-for-TAB})) {\n```\n\nWe have no key binding configuration for tab-to-next field. Which is OK. Just hard-code TAB.", "> Your text did not include a link to `org.jabref.gui.fieldeditors.FieldEditorFX#establishBinding`. Did you see this method?\n\nAh! Good to know. I implemented this feature by setting up a method in ` FieldEditorFX`  that moves the `TabPane` to the next tab if the user presses \"Tab\" while in the last `TextField` of the current tab. I created a method in `EntryEditor` that checks if the current `TextField` in focus is the last one by comparing its ID with the `Tab`'s  last `Field`'s name. Previously, each `TextField` didn???t have an ID set, so I updated this by setting each ID to the name of its original `Field`.\n\n**Reasons for this approach:**\n1. **EntryEditor context requirement:** We can't directly check if the current `Field` in focus is the last without `EntryEditor` context. Because of the way `TextFields` are created, we can???t directly locate the last `TextField` of a `Tab`, but we can easily identify the last `Field` in a tab. To bridge this gap, I assigned IDs to each `TextField` based on their original `Field` names, allowing for comparison.\n2. **Adheres to Field creation policy:** This approach adapts to changes in the last `TextField` depending on the active `Tab`, as all `TextFields` are initially created as `Fields`. Because each `TextField` is linked to a corresponding `Field` (with its ID matching the field's name), and the last field in a tab can always be identified through the `shownFields` method, all `TextField`s can be checked as the last `TextField`.\n\n**Alternative approach:** Another way to address this issue could be to modify the focus traversal list, so pressing \"Tab\" while a `TextField` is in focus cycles through the fields until reaching the last one, then moves to the next `Tab`. However, after spending a short while exploring this option it shows its challenges.\n\nIf you???re happy with this implementation, I can create a PR for you to review.

I'm looking at the current implementation, and I'm wondering if we can get away with fixing this _without_ waiting for an improvement to the TS parser. We just built that nifty [cooklang-reports](https://github.com/cooklang/cooklang-reports) PoC, and really, what this plugin seems to do is take a recipe as input and produce some structured output. Is it just me, or that a job for `cooklang-reports`?\n\nThat would obviate the need to do anything else here other than see about getting _that_ API into TS, and since it's basically just text-in and text-out, that would probably be easier.\n\nIt looks like the steps would be:\n\n1. Add `wasm_bindgen` to `render_template` function in `cooklang-reports` (just for starters)\n2.

      "description" : "## Current Situation\r\n[Meshery Catalog](https://meshery.io/catalog) has a relatively small number of published designs.\r\n\r\n## Desired Situation\r\n\r\nMeshery Catalog is populated with a variety of published designs, representing any number of technologies in the designs and representing different categories of designs. \r\n\r\n## Difficultly Level: Beginner\r\n\r\nThis is a beginner-level issue designed to both help introduce you, the contributor, to additional Kubernetes concepts and DevOps practices, and to aid in creating a robust catalog full of cloud native design patterns and sample apps in the Meshery Catalog.\r\n\r\n## Skills Needed\r\n\r\n1. No coding skills needed.\r\n2. Awareness of Kubernetes.\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\n1. **Identify a Kubernetes sample app**\r\n    1. Bring your own Kubernetes manifest or Helm Chart or Docker Compose file or...\r\n    3. ...or identify a sample app from any available in public repos ([example 1](https://github.com/AdminTurnedDevOps/kubernetes-examples), [example 2](https://github.com/kubernetes/examples), [example 3](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes-engine-samples)).\r\n    1. Attempt to identify resources that can benefit both newcomers and seasoned professionals.\r\n1. **Import Kubernetes App**\r\n    1. Import the sample application using import modal present in toolbar, [following this guide](https://docs.meshery.io/extensions/importing-a-design). \r\n1. **Publish Kubernetes App**\r\n    1. Publish your sample app into the Meshery Catalog. Guides: Using Meshery UI or [Using MeshMap](https://docs.meshery.io/extensions/publishing-a-design).\r\n1. **[Optional] Open App in Playground**\r\n    1. Access [Meshery Playground](https://play.meshery.io) and open your app in [MeshMap](https://docs.meshery.io/extensions/meshmap).\r\n1. **[Optional] Share your Kubernetes App**\r\n    1. Be social and share your imported apps on twitter or linkedin and the Meshery project accounts will repost.\r\n1. **Repeat**\r\n    1. Import and publish five or more sample apps.\r\n\r\n## Acceptance Criteria\r\n1. Five or more new sample apps have been imported into Meshery and published into the Meshery Catalog.\r\n\r\n---\r\n### Contributor [Guides](https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing) and [Handbook](https://layer5.io/community/handbook)\r\n- \uD83D\uDEE0 [Meshery Build & Release Strategy](https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/build-and-release)\r\n- \uD83D\uDCDA [Instructions for contributing to documentation](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#documentation-contribution-flow)\r\n   - Meshery documentation [site](https://docs.meshery.io/) and [source](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/tree/master/docs)\r\n- \uD83C\uDFA8 Wireframes and designs for Meshery UI in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/SMP3zxOjZztdOLtgN4dS2W/Meshery-UI)\r\n- \uD83D\uDE4B\uD83C\uDFFE\uD83D\uDE4B\uD83C\uDFFC Questions: [Discussion Forum](http://discuss.meshery.io) and [Community Slack](https://slack.meshery.io)\r\n",

This can result in duplicate titles when copying complex iterative nodes.\n\nTo fix this, the unique title generation logic (such as the `genNewNodeTitleFromOld` function) needs to be applied recursively to all child nodes during the copy process, not just to the top-level node. You can find the relevant logic in the `handleNodeIterationChildrenCopy` function and related utilities in the workflow codebase. Adjusting this to ensure every copied node gets a unique, incremented title should resolve the duplicate title issue in copied iterations with parallel branches.  \nMore details and code references can be found [here](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/blob/a4ef9009167ed7cf22b0b8bd3a903e8ba0a74567/web/app/components/workflow/hooks/use-nodes-interactions.ts) and [here](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/blob/a4ef9009167ed7cf22b0b8bd3a903e8ba0a74567/web/app/components/workflow/nodes/iteration/use-interactions.ts).\n\nAs of now, there are no documented workarounds or upstream fixes, so updating the recursive copy logic is the recommended approach.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

The current logic for generating node titles during copy doesn't guarantee unique titles for all nodes, especially for parallel branches inside iteration nodes. This leads to duplicate titles, which is not the expected behavior for auto-incrementing node names. The root cause is that top-level nodes use a function that ensures uniqueness, but child nodes inside iterations use a different approach that can result in duplicates. Fixing this would require unifying the title generation logic so every copied node, including children, gets a unique title as expected.

Actual Behavior\n\nAfter the variable aggregator selects the name field of first_record in the list operation, it can only select the file of last_recore itself, but not the name field of last_record, and the group type is also displayed as file instead of the string type of first_record.name.\n\n<img width=\"1032\" height=\"528\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2893c011-7658-4288-8ff6-c600bdd63c29\" />\n\n<img width=\"715\" height=\"491\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/889f4e2c-f50e-4e36-8021-16c7e9d01d6b\" />",

      "description" : "### Custom Node Testing\n\n- [x] I have tried disabling custom nodes and the issue persists (see [how to disable custom nodes](https://docs.comfy.org/troubleshooting/custom-node-issues#step-1%3A-test-with-all-custom-nodes-disabled) if you need help)\n\n### Frontend Version\n\n1.24.1 (latest)\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWhen typing an opening square bracket `[` in the node search box, the search should either:\n- Escape the special character properly in the regex\n- Continue to work without throwing an error\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nWhen typing `[` in the node search box popover component, the application throws a JavaScript error and the search functionality breaks.\n\nError: \n```\nvue.esm-browser.prod.js:5 SyntaxError: Invalid regular expression: /([)/gi: Unterminated character class (at formatUtil.ts:42:17)\n    at new RegExp (<anonymous>)\n    at highlightQuery (formatUtil.ts:42:17)\n    at Proxy.<anonymous> (NodeSearchItem.vue:81:15)\n```\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Open ComfyUI frontend\n2. Right-click on the canvas to open the node search box\n3. Type `[` (opening square bracket) in the search input\n4. Observe the JavaScript error in the browser console\n\n### Debug Logs\n\nN/A - Frontend only issue\n\n### Browser Logs\n\n```\nvue.esm-browser.prod.js:5 SyntaxError: Invalid regular expression: /([)/gi: Unterminated character class (at formatUtil.ts:42:17)\n    at new RegExp (<anonymous>)\n    at highlightQuery (formatUtil.ts:42:17)\n    at Proxy.<anonymous> (NodeSearchItem.vue:81:15)\n    at iJ (vue.esm-browser.prod.js:5:63907)\n    at ek.a [as fn] (vue.esm-browser.prod.js:5:53813)\n    at ek.run (vue.esm-browser.prod.js:5:7130)\n    at H (vue.esm-browser.prod.js:5:54179)\n    at U (vue.esm-browser.prod.js:5:52411)\n    at V (vue.esm-browser.prod.js:5:52226)\n    at x (vue.esm-browser.prod.js:5:49179)\n```\n\n### Setting JSON\n\nDefault settings (issue occurs with fresh installation)\n\n### What browsers do you use to access the UI ?\n\nGoogle Chrome, Mozilla Firefox\n\n### Other Information\n\nThe issue is in `src/utils/formatUtil.ts` at line 42 in the `highlightQuery` function:\n\n```typescript\nexport function highlightQuery(text: string, query: string) {\n  if (\\!query) return text\n  const regex = new RegExp(`(${query})`, 'gi')  // This line fails when query contains special regex characters\n  return text.replace(regex, '<span class=\"highlight\">$1</span>')\n}\n```\n\nThe function needs to escape special regex characters in the query string before creating the RegExp. Other special characters like `]`, `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `*`, `+`, `?`, `.`, `^`, `$`, ` < /dev/null | `, and `\\\\` would likely cause similar issues.\n\nThis might be related to FuseJS smart search syntax features being enabled, but the root cause is that the `highlightQuery` function doesn't escape regex special characters.\n\n???Issue is synchronized with this [Notion page](https://www.notion.so/Issue-4466-Bug-Typing-opening-square-bracket-in-node-search-box-causes-regex-error-2336d73d365081b5b6c8c5d575a3835a) by [Unito](https://www.unito.io)\n",

Syft is fine too. \r\n\r\nBefore your start working, can you outline in steps here what and how  you are planing to execute it, so we all have the same understanding.\r\n", "According to the documentation of trivy, first, we need to generate the SBOM file in the desired format. To do that I will make a container using dagger and make that JSON file and export it from that container to local using the below command :\r\n```\r\ntrivy image --format cyclonedx -o sbom.cdx.json <IMAGE>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, once we have got the SBOM file in the desired format, we need to replace this command in the below [file](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor-cli/blob/7f439409d79d9cb16bfed51ba7d25292a6da52c2/dagger/main.go#L365) with `attest` instead of `sign` to run this below command. This attest command attaches the SBOM to the image.\r\n```\r\ncosign attest --key /path/to/cosign.key --type cyclonedx --predicate sbom.cdx.json <IMAGE>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe the required changes will only need to be made in this [file](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor-cli/blob/main/dagger/main.go) in this particular [function](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor-cli/blob/7f439409d79d9cb16bfed51ba7d25292a6da52c2/dagger/main.go#L336C1-L371C2)\r\n\r\nSo, for now, I will first be fixing the format of the SBOM file. Later, we can add functionality to allow users to choose the SBOM format dynamically, as Trivy supports multiple formats. A list of these formats can be found [here](https://github.com/anchore/syft/blob/b4e7b64d5ce04b6636b46ffe4b900936a51a4ddd/README.md?plain=1#L106C1-L121C1).", "ok, its not the right thing, we are doing the same for the container already, you could just use that file.

Maybe you can compare the output of both options\r\n", "hi sorry for late reply as my uni had resumed so i didn't get to work further on this. \r\nNow i will resume work on this issue\r\n\r\n> we are doing the same for the container already, you could just use that file. \r\n\r\nCan you please attach the link of that file as i can't find where it is ?

This happens because Superset uses the `dom-to-image-more` library, which captures only what's currently rendered in the DOM???so if the chart/table is scrollable, only the visible section is included in the image export. There is no code in the current implementation to expand the table or render all rows before capturing the image, and no workarounds or enhancements for this have been documented or proposed in recent issues or pull requests [[source]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/e0e3f9494972e90b3eec7a23d75747e0e63c07c9/superset-frontend/src/utils/downloadAsImage.ts).\n\nThis limitation is specific to table and handlebar charts. Other chart types (like bar, line, or pie charts) that use ECharts can export the full chart regardless of what is visible, because ECharts provides its own export API that isn't limited by the DOM viewport.\n\nCurrently, the only alternatives are to export the data as CSV or use a browser extension to capture the full scrollable area, but these are not integrated solutions. If you need the full table as an image, you would need a feature enhancement that temporarily expands the table before capture or stitches together multiple images.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

The ECharts export API only works for ECharts-based charts like bar, line, or pie charts.\n\nFor table/handlebar charts, Superset uses dom-to-image-more, which captures only what's currently rendered in the DOM. Since the DataTable component paginates and virtualizes rows, only the visible portion is exported as an image???there's no built-in logic to expand or render all rows before export. To capture the full table, you'd need to programmatically disable pagination and virtualization (e.g., set page size to all rows), wait for the DOM to update, trigger the image export, and then restore the original state. This approach can cause major performance issues for large tables and isn't currently implemented in Superset. See the relevant code for DataTable and downloadAsImage for more details:  \n[downloadAsImage.ts](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/2e9939baf253e607a54722b1996baaf625e72133/superset-frontend/src/utils/downloadAsImage.ts)  \n[DataTable.tsx](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/2e9939baf253e607a54722b1996baaf625e72133/superset-frontend/plugins/plugin-chart-table/src/DataTable/DataTable.tsx)\n\nAny solution will need to balance user experience and performance, especially for large datasets. There are no alternative export methods or workarounds documented in the repo.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

They are added automatically to the `MANIFEST.MF` file. \n- `jars.extra.classpath` is used to add singular jar files that are compiled but not imported (not required at runtime). As of right now, `jars.extra.classpath` only supports adding jar files from workspace projects. We want it to be able to add bundles from the local workspace or target platform as well. \n\nIn addition to understanding the differences between the two features, we also familiarized ourself with the Eclipse ui framework by creating a simple perspective plugin.\n\n<img width=\"720\" height=\"405\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4be2392-8c4b-4db7-bc44-abfbc3071394\" />\n\nWhat we plan to do:\n\n- Modify `jars.extra.classpath` so that users can add bundles from the target platform or local workspace \n- Add a description to the \"Automated Management of Dependencies\" view and a link to \"Extra Classpath Entries\" that says \n???You can go to the build page (link here) to add compile-only dependencies to the plugin.??? \n\nThese are the files that we think are relevant to this issue. \n\n- `BuildClassPathSection.java`: contains the logic for the Extra Classpath Entries feature which is what we will be changing to be able to add bundles from target platform or workspace\n- `DependencyManagement.java`: contains the logic for the Automated Management of Dependencies feature, which currently supports adding bundles, and what we will be using as inspiration to be added to Extra Classpath Entries. \n- `BuildPage.java`: UI page for Extra Classpath Entries. \n- `DependencyPage.java`: UI page for Automated Management of Dependencies.   \n\nWe want guidance on whether we should add another button (between the Add JARs??? and Remove button) which is intended to specifically add bundles, or just change the ???Add JARs?????? button so that users can add both singular jar files and bundles through the same button.\n\n- Option 1: separate button for bundles from singular jar files\n- Option 2: add a search bar to the ???Add JARs?????? view and have both jar files and bundles in the same view. \n\nWe wanted to propose these two options because having a separate button for jar files and a separate button for bundles allows for users to add exactly what they want and not have to search through one long list, but it may also make the ui a little bit cluttered so combining the two into one button with a search bar may also work. \n\nIs our understanding of the project correct and if so, is our plan for implementation fit for this issue?", "I think the best is to just start and see how things work out (e.g. one button versus two buttons), then present a screenshot (to see how text / link looks like).", "> As of right now, jars.extra.classpath only supports adding jar files from workspace projects. \n\nNot, both is possible.\n\n> We want it to be able to add bundles from the local workspace or target platform as well.\n\nThis is already possible, at least from local workspace. Not sure about target file.\n\n<img width=\"1530\" height=\"944\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5341cd94-0b7d-4d9f-bee1-a086404e5045\" />", "> Not, both is possible\n\nCan you then please share a screenshot that proofs that?

Not sure about target file.\n\nWhat you show is text files using this feature to refrence a JAR so I'm not really sure what exactly \"already possible\" mean here in this context.", "By the way here is an example of how such entry looks **without a jar(!)** and yes it works in Tycho and the IDE and regardless of workspace or target content:\n\nhttps://github.com/eclipse-tycho/tycho/blob/main/demo/lombok/lombok-bundle/build.properties\n\nI hope this makes it more clear." ],

      "url" : "https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/issues/30116",
      "repositoryName" : "openvinotoolkit/openvino",
      "description" : "### Context\n\n\uD83D\uDE80**A great opportunity to contribute to two popular AI projects with just one PR:: [Keras 3](https://github.com/keras-team/keras) and [OpenVINO](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino).**\uD83D\uDE80 \n\nKeras 3 enables seamless switching between supported backends???PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX???for both training and inference of traditional models and LLMs/GenAI pipelines. Since Keras 3.8.0, we've introduced a preview version of the OpenVINO backend (for inference only), allowing developers to leverage OpenVINO for model predictions directly within Keras 3 workflows. Activating the OpenVINO backend requires just one line of code to run inference on Keras 3-trained models. Here???s an example for a BERT model from Keras Hub:\n\n```\nimport os\nos.environ[\"KERAS_BACKEND\"] = \"openvino\"\nimport numpy as np\nimport keras\nimport keras_hub\n\nfeatures = {\n    \"token_ids\": np.ones(shape=(2, 12), dtype=\"int32\"),\n    \"segment_ids\": np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]] * 2),\n    \"padding_mask\": np.array([[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]] * 2),\n}\n\nclassifier = keras_hub.models.BertTextClassifier.from_preset(\"bert_base_en_uncased\", num_classes=4, preprocessor=None)\noutput = classifier.predict(features)\n```\n\nCurrently, the OpenVINO backend lacks support for some operations. Our goal is to resolve this gap and to optimize it for inference on Intel devices???including CPUs, integrated GPUs, discrete GPUs, and NPUs???by supporting as many models as possible while delivering optimal performance. We aim to make the OpenVINO backend **the No. 1 choice for model inference within the Keras 3 workflow**.\n\n### What needs to be done?\n\nSteps to Contribute\n1. Set up your developer environment:\n- fork and clone [keras repo](https://github.com/keras-team/keras)\n- install requirements for OpenVINO backend development `pip install -r requirements-openvino.txt`. The requirements file can be found in the root directory of cloned repository\n\n2. Provide decomposition in Python for [numpy.meshgrid](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/keras/src/backend/openvino/numpy.py) using [OpenVINO opset](https://docs.openvino.ai/2025/documentation/openvino-ir-format/operation-sets/operation-specs.html)\n\n3. Include tests by removing line corresponding to the implemented operation in [excluded_concrete_tests.txt file](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/keras/src/backend/openvino/excluded_concrete_tests.txt).\n\n4. Make sure that tests are passing\n\n- create `pytest.ini` file and place it in the root directory of the clone repository. This file should contain the following content:\n```\n[pytest]\nenv =\n    KERAS_BACKEND=openvino\n```\n- run tests `pytest-c ./pytest.ini ./keras/src/ops/numpy_test.py`\n\n5. Commit your changes and create PR in keras repository. Mention @rkazants in PR description for review.\n\nBelow is an  exemplar PR of how support for numpy.amax has been implemented.\n\n### Example Pull Requests\n\n- https://github.com/keras-team/keras/pull/20883\n\n### Resources\n\n- [OpenVINO Operation Set Documentation](https://docs.openvino.ai/2025/documentation/openvino-ir-format/operation-sets/operation-specs.html)\n- [Examples of How TensorFlow operations are decomposed using OV opset in C++](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/tree/master/src/frontends/tensorflow_common/src/op)\n- Check decompositions of the required operation in other backends\n\n### Contact points\n\n@rkazants \n\n### AI notice - Important!\n\nWe encourage contributors to use AI tools responsibly when creating Pull Requests. While AI can be a valuable aid, it is essential to ensure that your contributions meet the task requirements, build successfully, include relevant tests, and pass all linters. **Submissions that do not meet these standards may be closed without warning to maintain the quality and integrity of the project.** Please take the time to understand the changes you are proposing and their impact.\n\n\n### Ticket\n\n_No response_",

It would help to automate this during the website build process.\n\nThe idea here is:\n* add templating support to the website resources, so that the build would interpret templating instructions, not only variable references supported by the resources plugin\n* replace references to specific GlassFish versions with variables\n* redefine a variable with a specific version before each block and then reuse it in the whole block\n\nFor example, with velocity engine, it could look like:\n\n```\n#set($version = \"7.0.24\")\n\nGlassFish version $version brings new features...\n\nDownload at https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/ee4j/glassfish/glassfish-$version.zip\n\n#set($version = \"7.0.23\")\n\nGlassFish version $version brings new features...\n\nDownload at https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/ee4j/glassfish/glassfish-$version.zip\n\n```\n\nPossible options:\n\n* replace the standard maven resources plugin with an existing maven plugin that supports templating, e.g. [MojoHaus Templating Maven Plugin](https://www.mojohaus.org/templating-maven-plugin/)\n* create a [custom resource filter](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-resources-plugin/examples/custom-resource-filters.html) for the resources plugin that calls velocity or some other templating engine - no such custom resource exists out of the box, we would have to create one and wrap a templating engine\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nHappens everytime we update the glassfish.org website after a new GlassFish release.\n\n### Impact of Issue\n\n_No response_",

This class supports relatively robust serialization out of the box, but I think it would be nice to allow users to specify how to serialize objects within the observation. As an example, an observation may have an input with args: `(str, pd.DataFrame)` object as function input or output. \r\n\r\nThe default logic here assumes that this input is serializable, but in fact we need to specify how to serialize the DataFrame. Additionally, it is possible that the order of checks in the `EventSerializer.default()` method should be altered such that serialization of `Sequence`s comes before that of `list`s or `tuple`s (though I can appreciate there being a LOT of edge cases here...hence the request for general, custom serialization).\r\n\r\nA `CustomEventSerializer` could be injected as an arg to `Langfuse()` to allow clients to specify how to handle arbitrary types, which is extremely useful when tracking observation inputs and outputs from span to span in conjunction with generation observations (practically speaking, I'm referring to agentic tool-calling scenarios)\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n_No response_</div>",

So, could you please assign this to me ?\r\n\r\n## Plan Overview:\r\n\r\n`Modify the Langfuse Client:`\r\n\r\nAdd an optional serializer parameter to the client constructor. If no custom serializer is provided, it will default to using the existing EventSerializer.\r\n\r\n`Inject Custom Serializer:`\r\n\r\nUpdate the serialization process to use the provided custom serializer (if any). This allows users to define how specific objects, such as pd.DataFrame, should be serialized.\r\n\r\n`Example Use Case:`\r\n\r\nUsers could pass in a custom serializer to handle objects like pandas DataFrames or other non-JSON serializable types, which may not be covered by the default EventSerializer.\r\n\r\nLet me know if there are any adjustments or additional considerations to take into account.\r\n\r\nThanks!", "Created a small PR for the Python SDK here: https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse-python/pull/1116", "Hello, @hassiebp.\nI was wondering if there are any plans to merge PR https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse-python/pull/1116\nI need to modify the `EventSerializer`, and it would be helpful if custom serializers were officially supported.", "Hi @kexplo - could you please explain what exact use case requires you to have a custom serializer? I'm trying to understand whether there's a possible workaround", "We're a using gRPC stack, and the current `EventSerializer` implementation in Langfuse doesn't properly serialize the request and response objects from the packages we use.\nThat's why we needed modifications like [this one](https://github.com/a15t/langfuse-python/commit/5859d6a7c167f6d145e6fb02adac3caa34c4600d).\nIf we modify the `EventSerializer` directly, we'd have to use a forked version of the Langfuse repo, since it felt a bit unreasonable to open a PR asking to merge code that only applies to our use case.\n\nI think it makes more sense to support custom serializer so users can register their own serializers for arbitrary types, rather than trying to make the built-in `EventSerializer` handle every possible object for all Langfuse users.\n\nWe've already forked the repo and applied a custom workaround, so I wasn't trying to rush the merge of PR https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse-python/pull/1116.\nIt's just that keeping up with upstream changes might be a bit of a hassle, so I was wondering if there are any plans to support a custom serializer.\n\nthanks for your reply!", "Got it, thanks! I assume you are using the decorator and the request and response objects are in the function args / kwargs / return value? In those cases, rather than overwriting the serializer we recommend to set `@observe(capture_input=False, capture_output=False)` and set the input output manually with `langfuse_context.update_current_observation(input=???)` where input / output are serializable values.", "Hey @hassiebp,\nI would like to contribute on this issue. So, if its still open could you please assign this to me ?", "@pc099 Thanks a lot for your offer!

We can implement a exponential backoff strategy where the time window increases until the service is back up again.\n\nRegarding the proposed exponential backoff strategy ??? will notifications be sent only once during a continuous incident, until the issue is resolved? Or is the scope of this feature only the incident resolution strategy? Currently, all 5 incidents cause a notification delivery event, right?\n\nFor example:\n- 1st incident ??? notification sent ??????\n- 2nd incident (after 2 minutes) ??? no notification \uD83D\uDD15\n- 3rd incident (after 4 minutes) ??? no notification \uD83D\uDD15\n- 4th incident (after 8 minutes) ??? no notification \uD83D\uDD15\n- 5th incident (after 16 minutes) ??? no notification \uD83D\uDD15\n- 6th incident (after 32 minutes, service recovers) ??? resolution notification sent ??????\n\nIs this the intended behavior?

Although in my, admittedly limited, usage of Checkmate I have not found this to be an issue.\n\nIn my environment I have setup a webhook notification. I only receive notifications when a monitor first goes down and when it comes back up. This is, in my opinion, the intended behaviour. \n\nMaybe I am not understanding something correctly but the PR seems to fix something that isn't broken and in doing so, makes monitors worse. What is the exact problem this issue deems to solve?", "Hi @FirefoxNL \n\nI believe this issue primarily addresses notification fatigue. The intervals for checking service status are not affected by these changes. The existing status check intervals, such as a 5-minute per service, will remain consistent. The changes only impact the intervals at which responsible admins are repeatedly notified when a service is down. Once a service recovers to a healthy state, the admin immediately receives a positive notification.\n\nThe intent of this ticket is to avoid receiving only \"serice down & up\" notifications, but rather to provide regular updates." ],

Specifically, if they would be open to add support for the ECR, SX, U1, U2, U3 gates or what's missing to support these. The main motivation being that these are the last gates to allow a seamless translation between MQT Operations and Catalyst Operations.", "Thank you @BertiFlorea for your help, it's much appreciated!\n@burgholzer, I will talk with Erick and ask him about the missing gates on Monday.", "Update: The gates are not supported because the `lightning.qubit` device doesn't either. The Catalyst team is working on additional decompositions at the MLIR level to eventually support these gates. That is, of course, the gate itself won't be directly supported, but with an existing decomposition, it won't be marked illegal anymore. Now, until then, we could also do the same and decompose them in our conversions. \nI saw, @BertiFlorea, you did this already with other unsupported gates. Does that mean there were no easy decompositions to be found for the last few? Based on the two links you referenced, these are:\n\n```\n        # qml.SX(wires=0)\n        # qml.ECR(wires=[0,1])\n        # qml.SISWAP(wires=[0,1])\n        # qml.Toffoli(wires=[0,1,2])\n        # qml.PauliRot(x, 'IXYZ', wires=[0,1,2,3])\n        # qml.U1(x, wires=0)\n        # qml.U2(x, x, wires=0)\n        # qml.U3(x, x, x, wires=0)\n```\n\nActually, for some, a decomposition seems already present as noted, e.g., [here](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.PauliRot.html).", "Yeah. Let's do that then for now.\nDecompositions for all of these can easily be derived from Qiskit. I believe we even have some decompositions within the MQT Core DD Package.", "Many thanks for the help! \uD83D\uDE4F\uD83C\uDFFC \n\nI am adding this comment just to provide some clarity in case someone else is reading this task in the future and tries to understand what happened.\n\nInitially, the gate operation conversions were part of this PR #880. However, since #880 got closed and the focus moved to the plugin PR #881, the conversions had to be moved there as well. All conversions can be seen from [this](https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/core/blob/8686445b44b81c727b43c008575a5aaaf17479a2/plugins/catalyst/lib/Conversion/MQTOptToCatalystQuantum/MQTOptToCatalystQuantum.cpp#L274) point onward." ],

What we want to do here is to have another version of the template files that uses `ament_cmake_python`, similar to [what's described in the docs](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/How-To-Guides/Ament-CMake-Python-Documentation.html).\n\nIn my comment above (https://github.com/ros2/ros2cli/issues/739#issuecomment-2810590122), I proposed to select the version of the template files using a new `--template-name` option, which could only be used with `--build-type ament_cmake`, since it only applies to the `ament_cmake` build type:\n\n1. `--build-type ament_cmake`: uses the [current template](https://github.com/ros2/ros2cli/blob/rolling/ros2pkg/ros2pkg/resource/ament_cmake/CMakeLists.txt.em)\n2. `--build-type ament_cmake --template-name cmake`: uses the current template too (we assume that `--template-name cmake` is the default with `--build-type ament_cmake`)\n3. `--build-type ament_cmake --template-name python`: uses a new template for `ament_cmake` packages that contain Python code and thus use `ament_cmake_python`, like the one in https://github.com/ros2/ros2cli/pull/904\n\nThe files for the two different versions (1&2 vs 3 above) are _almost_ the same, except for these extra lines in the template files used when we select `--template-name python`:\n\n1.  `CMakeLists.txt`:\n    1. Add `find_package(ament_cmake_python REQUIRED)` at the top, [as shown here](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/How-To-Guides/Ament-CMake-Python-Documentation.html#using-ament-cmake-python)\n    2. Add `ament_python_install_package(${PROJECT_NAME})` before the tests, [as shown here](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/How-To-Guides/Ament-CMake-Python-Documentation.html#using-ament-cmake-python)\n    3. Add some code for Python tests inside `if(BUILD_TESTING) ... endif()`, [as shown here](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/How-To-Guides/Ament-CMake-Python-Documentation.html#using-ament-cmake-pytest)\n1. `package.xml`:\n    1. Add a `buildtool_depend` on `ament_cmake_python`, [as shown here](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/How-To-Guides/Ament-CMake-Python-Documentation.html#using-ament-cmake-python)\n    2. Add a `test_depend` on `ament_cmake_pytest`, [as shown here](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/How-To-Guides/Ament-CMake-Python-Documentation.html#using-ament-cmake-pytest)\n\nDoes that help? Since the files are almost the same, you could have one set of template files and only include the `ament_cmake_python` parts I described above using some `@[if ...]@` conditions in the `.em` template file _if_ the user selects ` --template-name python`.\n\nIf you've already made some changes in a branch, you could create a PR and we can discuss there.", "@christophebedard I am almost done with the changes, I just want to know on how to handle node name and library name ?\nDo I take those arguments in consideration and if yes, then which kind should be generated (python or cmake) ?", "Please open a PR. It can be a draft PR, and you can ask your questions there.", "@christophebedard created a draft PR at #1080 " ],

Some pages in the Launchpad manual have broken internal links because they have been recently migrated from another site and are yet to be correctly linked to each other. Launchpad's docs are now hosted on Read the Docs and are written in restructured text or markdown. When linking these docs, it is recommended that the [:ref: method](https://canonical-starter-pack.readthedocs-hosted.com/latest/reference/style-guide/#internal-references) described in the style guide be used. Using :ref: instead of a file path makes it less likely that the link will break if a file is renamed or moved to a different folder.\n\nTask\n-------\nThe pages linked below have one or more broken internal links. Direct the links to the correct pages within the docs using the :ref: method mentioned above. You may need to add a target to a file you're linking to if one is not already present.\n\n[git-hosting](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/launchpad/en/latest/user/explanation/working-with-code/git-hosting/) \n[message-rationale-headers](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/launchpad/en/latest/user/explanation/message-rationale-headers/)",

      "description" : "**This task has been created for UbuCon EU (OpenSouthCode 2025) to assist community members make their first documentation contribution.**\n\nBackground\n------------------\nSome folders in the [Launchpad user docs](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/launchpad/en/latest/user/) don???t have a dedicated index page that can be referenced by other pages. In most cases, the Toctree that should be in the index file has been placed inside one of the files in the folder. This approach leads to the file containing the toctree to be displayed when a folder/category is clicked instead of an index page. Additionally, the file containing the toctree is typically excluded from the toctree itself. Therefore, it doesn???t show up on the left-hand side menu.\n\nTask\n-------\nCreate a file called index.rst within the [users/explanation/working-with-code](https://github.com/canonical/launchpad-manual/edit/main/user/explanation/working-with-code/) folder. Next, locate the file within the folder containing the toctree. Cut (don't copy) and paste the toctree to the new index.rst file. If it wasn???t already included, add an entry in the toctree for the file that originally contained the toctree. Delete ???:hidden:??? from the toctree if present, and change ???:maxdepth:??? to 1. Add a heading above the toctree. This must be the same as the folder name.\n\nTo preview what a successful implementation should look like, check the [feature-highlights folder](https://github.com/canonical/launchpad-manual/tree/main/user/explanation/feature-highlights) and the index.rst file within.",

Bazaar has largely fallen out of favor, but is still used by some individuals and communities. From September 1st, 2025, users will not have access to Bazaar. They are, therefore, advised to migrate their repositories to Git before the deadline.\n\nTask\n-------\nAdd an info box in docs that make reference to Bazaar letting users know that it is being discontinued. Due to the number of docs affected, this should not be done manually in every doc. Add an appropriately named .rst file in the /includes folder and reference this file near the top of each affected doc (preferably under any includes already present). \n\nThe text in the info box must:\n- Inform users that Bazaar is being discontinued\n- Tell affected users to migrate their code from Bazaar to git and the deadline for migration\n- Link to [this page](https://blog.launchpad.net/general/phasing-out-bazaar-code-hosting) \n- Not be longer than two lines\n\nTo preview the expected result, check the existing files in the Launchpad manual [/includes](https://github.com/canonical/launchpad-manual/tree/main/includes) folder.",

      "repositoryName" : "mui/mui-x",
      "description" : "### Steps to reproduce\n\nSteps:\n1. Open this link to live example:  [MUI Docs](https://mui.com/x/react-charts/axis/)\n2. Scroll down to \"Text Customization\" section\n3. Increase font size of label or tick label\n\n\n### Current behavior\n\nAs the font sizes grow, the regular label, or the tick label begins to truncate, until the font size is increased enough to make the label disappear altogether. The `<tspan>` element still gets rendered but with no text value. This happens when you change styling on either the X or Y axis label, or their respective tick labels using `fontSize`, `angle`, or `textAnchor`, etc...\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nLabels should be rendered with appropriate styling with specified angle, font size, etc...\nPerhaps instead of truncating or omitting the label value entirely, the labels should grow and bump/push surrounding elements out as necessary and allow the developer to decide what balance of spacing/padding/margin is acceptable.\n\n### Context\n\nI'm developing an internal tool for my company that requires visualizing data from various queries and not everyone has hawk eyes, so I need to increase label sizes, rotate tick labels to ensure values fit into view, and overall apply some basic styling beyond what comes out of the box. Right now I can't rotate the X axis tick labels (short-hand dates) in my `<Linechart />` without having them disappear completely. This is a common necessity across various visuals I have and I'd REALLY like to be able to do so.\n\n### Your environment\n\n<details>\n  <summary><code>npx @mui/envinfo</code></summary>\n\n```\nBrowser: Version 138.0.7204.100\nSystem:\n    OS: Linux 5.15 Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS 24.04.2 LTS (Noble Numbat)\n  Binaries:\n    Node: 22.14.0 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v22.14.0/bin/node\n    npm: 10.9.2 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v22.14.0/bin/npm\n    pnpm: 10.5.2 - /mnt/c/nvm4w/nodejs/pnpm\n  Browsers:\n    Chrome: Not Found\n  npmPackages:\n    @emotion/react:  11.14.0 \n    @emotion/styled:  11.14.1 \n    @mui/core-downloads-tracker:  7.2.0 \n    @mui/icons-material:  7.2.0 \n    @mui/material:  7.2.0 \n    @mui/private-theming:  7.2.0 \n    @mui/styled-engine:  7.2.0 \n    @mui/system:  7.2.0 \n    @mui/types:  7.4.4 \n    @mui/utils:  7.2.0 \n    @mui/x-charts:  8.7.0 \n    @mui/x-charts-vendor:  8.5.3 \n    @mui/x-data-grid:  8.7.0 \n    @mui/x-date-pickers:  8.7.0 \n    @mui/x-internal-gestures:  0.2.0 \n    @mui/x-internals:  8.7.0 \n    @types/react:  19.1.8 \n    react:  19.1.0 \n    react-dom:  19.1.0 \n    typescript:  5.8.3\n```\n</details>\n\n\n**Search keywords**: tickLabelStyle labelStyle linechart",

However, we are considering to implement an improved implementation of `showModal` method where the additional logic needed to pass context to shwonModally will be automated. Currently, you would need to attach to the 'shownModally' event on the **frame** as the frame is the view (1st parameter) passed in `showModal` method. \r\n\r\n**Feature request:** Loggin this one as a feature to simplify the logic behind `showModal` method\r\n\r\n**Current state**\r\nFor example, here is how you could pass the context from `home-page` (the host) to the `modal-page` (the modal)\r\n\r\n`home-page.ts`\r\n```TS\r\nconst frame = new Frame();\r\n\r\nframe.on(\"shownModally\", (args: ShownModallyData) => {\r\n    frame.navigate({ \r\n        moduleName: \"modal/modal-page\", \r\n        context: args.context // passing the context from showModal\r\n    });\r\n})\r\n\r\nlet contextToPass = \"Context passed from home-page\";\r\npage.showModal(frame, contextToPass,\r\n    (receivedContext) => {\r\n        console.log(\"home-page modal frame closed\");\r\n        console.log(\"[home-page] Received context from closeModal callback: \", receivedContext);\r\n    }, true);\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then in the modal you could access the context with `navigatedTo` event in  `modal-page.ts`\r\n```TS\r\nimport { Page, NavigatedData } from \"tns-core-modules/ui/page\";\r\nimport { View, EventData } from \"tns-core-modules/ui/core/view\";\r\n\r\nexport function onTap(args: EventData) {\r\n    const view = args.object as View;\r\n    const page = view.page as Page;\r\n    page.frame.navigate({ \r\n        moduleName: \"modal-second/modal-second-page\", \r\n        context: \"Context passed from modal-page (1)\"\r\n    });\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport function onNavigatedTo(args: NavigatedData) {\r\n    console.log(\"[modal-page] Received context: \", args.context);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n `modal-page.xml`\r\n```XML\r\n<Page backgroundColor=\"green\" navigatedTo=\"onNavigatedTo\">\r\n    <ActionBar>\r\n        <Label text=\"Modal\"></Label>\r\n    </ActionBar>\r\n    <StackLayout backgroundColor=\"lightGreen\">\r\n        <Button text=\"Navigate To Second Page\" tap=\"onTap\" />\r\n    </StackLayout>\r\n</Page>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above scenario will be implemented in the demo app via [this PR](https://github.com/NativeScript/modal-navigation-demo/pull/5)", "Hi i'm interested in working on this issue", "> Hi i'm interested in working on this issue\n\nBy all means.

As stated in [InsecureIssuerURLContext](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/coreos/go-oidc/v3/oidc#InsecureIssuerURLContext) it is for Azure and this is where we have this issue. We were providing extenstion issuer_url property with discovery endpoint address and this is causing the missmatch. \nIf a separate property would be available for autodiscovery, I think it would help to solve this issue." ],

Each emitter implements specific operation from low level OpenVINO dialect.\n\n### Prerequisites\nDue to limited resources, cross compilation is preferred option now for building OpenVINO targeting RISC-V development boards. Please see the documentation [\"Cross compile OpenVINO??? Runtime for RISCV64 systems\"](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/docs/dev/build_riscv64.md) for more details. For this work, you need to build [`xuantie-gnu-toolchain`](https://github.com/XUANTIE-RV/) or [`riscv-gnu-toolchain`](https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain.git) with `QEMU` support for emulation. So you don't need to have RISC-V development board even to contribute to OpenVINO for these platforms \uD83D\uDE03 \n\n### What needs to be done?\n\n* Create `fp32` [SoftPlus](https://docs.openvino.ai/2025/documentation/openvino-ir-format/operation-sets/operation-specs/activation/softplus-4.html) operation [JIT Emitter](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/emitters/plugin/riscv64/jit_eltwise_emitters.hpp) for RISCV64 platform with RVV1.0 support.

Each emitter implements specific operation from low level OpenVINO dialect.\n\n### Prerequisites\nDue to limited resources, cross compilation is preferred option now for building OpenVINO targeting RISC-V development boards. Please see the documentation [\"Cross compile OpenVINO??? Runtime for RISCV64 systems\"](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/docs/dev/build_riscv64.md) for more details. For this work, you need to build [`xuantie-gnu-toolchain`](https://github.com/XUANTIE-RV/) or [`riscv-gnu-toolchain`](https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain.git) with `QEMU` support for emulation.

      "description" : "## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI'd like to develop Apache Sedona from VSCode and it's a generally popular IDE that others might want to use too!\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe developer guide ( https://sedona.apache.org/latest/community/develop/ ) only gives instructions for IntelliJ.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce the problem\r\n\r\nThe steps I took initially to set up my environment were:\r\n\r\n- Install Java 8, Spark 3.3.0, and Scala 2.12.0 (i.e., the default versions in the Maven profile because not all VSCode extensions know about profiles, although some of them do). I'm not great at Java/Spark/Scala and I don't know if it's strictly required to have all of these installed via some system mechanism.\r\n- Install the Red Hat Java extension, the Maven extension, and the Metals extension (for Scala)\r\n\r\nThis gets me some but not all VSCode features. The ones that work are:\r\n\r\n- Run maven commands via the command palette (and maven commands in the terminal)\r\n- Autocomplete when editing Java and Scala files\r\n- The ability to run tests via Maven\r\n- The ability to run Java tests via the Tests panel (Scala tests aren't discovered here, possibly because the version of Scala in the default profile is too old for the Metals extension, or maybe some other reason).\r\n\r\nThings that don't work are:\r\n\r\n- There's two files that complain about a missing package ( `The import org.apache.sedona.sql.utils cannot be resolvedJava(268435846)`, `The import org.apache.sedona.spark cannot be resolvedJava(268435846)`). I'm wondering if this is a \"default spark version is too old\" issue.\r\n\r\nI haven't tried the Java or Scala debuggers yet.\r\n\r\n## Settings\r\n\r\nI have a devcontainer file that may or may not be helpful to come up with a recipe for setting up VSCode...I think it could probably use some refinement (e.g., I probably installed some extension after starting up the container).\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n```\r\n// For format details, see https://aka.ms/devcontainer.json.

For example, setting `srcDir: 'client'` in the layer's `nuxt.config.ts` and renaming the folder to `client/` still leaves `pages` typings broken.\n\nThe only way to fix the typings is to place `pages/` inside a default `app/` directory within each layer. For projects with many layers, this creates significant clutter.\n\nIs it intended that `pages` in layers are strictly tied to the `app/` directory for type safety, ignoring the `srcDir` config?

The implementation may be quite simple, simpler than what we do for fetch/pull/push. \n\nhttps://github.com/iterative/dvc/blob/b4d8690799c84c2b1f58822523a44a85c96a695e/dvc/repo/fetch.py#L47-L50\n\n```python\nif remote:\n    repo.config[\"core\"] = remote\n```\n\nwhich is equivalent to what you do above through CLI.\n\n> \n> * `-e` (or another name) that returns a non-zero exit code if any data is not in the remote.\n> \n> \n> The resulting command would then be:\n> \n> ```\n> dvc data status --not-in-remote --remote s3-remote -e\n> ```\n\nI am not sure about this. `data status` is more about local status, so I don't want to add an option specific to remote statuses.\n\nWe could add `--exit-code` that would return nonzero exit code if there are any changes (not including remote). And when `--not-in-remote` is also used, that'd also take \"not_in_remote\" changes into account for considering exit code.\n\nI don't think this will be any different to:\n```\ndvc data status --not-in-remote | grep \"No changes\" \n```\n\nThe `-exit-code` is however more reliable, as we could change the message and break it. But we also have `--json` for machine readable output that you could use.\n\n```console\ndvc data status --not-in-remote --json |  jq --exit-status '. == {}'\n```\n\n" ],

Any guidance would be appreciated!\n\nFirstly, in RunCommand, we overrode the getOptions method from the BaseCommand class in our RunCommand and configured it to accept an optional environment-slug flag with both a short and long version.\n\n<img width=\"619\" height=\"270\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4f9312a-2f8f-4ff2-8830-1d574687d2dc\" />\n\nWe verified that this works by printing our passed in slug to the console when we would run the keyshade run command.\n\nWe investigated through the codebase and found a file called `update.config.ts` which seemed to already have logic created for updating the keyshade.json file. Using this, we decided to reference and borrow some of that logic for our RunCommand, creating a private helper function called updateEnvironmentConfig, and calling that in our action method if the environmentSlug flag was passed in:\n\n<img width=\"621\" height=\"270\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2da2d78-5e6f-4c5e-89c8-a4dee2f49847\" />\n\n<img width=\"617\" height=\"165\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a3d18b2-4f3e-4035-b5a3-ce4dcf548303\" />\n\nWe tested this using a demo NextJS application that we created, and verified that the environment in our keyshade.json file is successfully being overwritten with the one passed in using the environment slug flag.\n\n**Some Questions**\nGiven that our implementation does borrow logic from existing functions/code in `update.config.ts`, to keep code reuse at a minimum, one idea we had was to delegate our config update methods into a singular utility method which can be reused in both RunCommand and UpdateConfig. Does this sound like a good approach? If somebody could direct us on where code reuse is practiced within the codebase that'd be helpful as well!\n\nFurthermore, there seems to be no proper validation for whether or not the passed in environment exists within the user???s workspace. As of right now, if you change the environment slug to an environment that does not exist, it throws an API Error. We were wondering if there should be some kind of validation for existing environments so that the error that gets thrown is specific to a non-existent environment. \n\nAny feedback or advice would be greatly appreciated!\n", "Hey there! The purpose of the flag would be to override the environment slug at runtime, in memory only. We won't need you to write that to the keyshade.json file! \n\n> there seems to be no proper validation for whether or not the passed in environment exists\n\nYes you are correct, we don't yet do any validation in here. But the run command validates this on startup and fails if there's invalid configuration." ],

      "description" : "### Context\n\n[JIT Emitters](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/emitters/README.md) are part of code generation feature (a.k.a. tensor compiler) that automatically produces highly-efficient optimized fused subgraph binary code. Each emitter implements specific operation from low level OpenVINO dialect.\n\n### Prerequisites\nDue to limited resources, cross compilation is preferred option now for building OpenVINO targeting RISC-V development boards. Please see the documentation [\"Cross compile OpenVINO??? Runtime for RISCV64 systems\"](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/docs/dev/build_riscv64.md) for more details. For this work, you need to build [`xuantie-gnu-toolchain`](https://github.com/XUANTIE-RV/) or [`riscv-gnu-toolchain`](https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain.git) with `QEMU` support for emulation. So you don't need to have RISC-V development board even to contribute to OpenVINO for these platforms \uD83D\uDE03 \n\n### What needs to be done?\n\n* Create `fp32` [SquaredDifference](https://docs.openvino.ai/2025/documentation/openvino-ir-format/operation-sets/operation-specs/arithmetic/squared-difference-1.html) operation [JIT Emitter](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/emitters/plugin/riscv64/jit_eltwise_emitters.hpp) for RISCV64 platform with RVV1.0 support. Use OpenVINO [CPU plugin JIT emitters](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/emitters/README.md) documentation and [RISC-V \"V\" Vector Extension](https://github.com/riscvarchive/riscv-v-spec/releases/tag/v1.0) documentation for details.\n* Support your implemented JIT Emitter in the [JIT Executor](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/4ebe493140b90cbaaa68e2c71fe8e1dbd7461822/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/nodes/eltwise.cpp#L805).\n* Modify [RISCV64 kernel](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/4ebe493140b90cbaaa68e2c71fe8e1dbd7461822/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/nodes/kernels/riscv64/jit_uni_eltwise_generic.hpp#L19) (in both places: [create_eltwise_emitter](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/4ebe493140b90cbaaa68e2c71fe8e1dbd7461822/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/nodes/kernels/riscv64/jit_uni_eltwise_generic.cpp#L401) and [get_supported_precisions](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/4ebe493140b90cbaaa68e2c71fe8e1dbd7461822/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/nodes/kernels/riscv64/jit_uni_eltwise_generic.cpp#L528)) to apply developed JIT emitter.\n\nBefore emitter implementation, please, modify tests to be sure that developed functionality is covered by test:\n * Add `jit` kernel check in [eltwise](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/0a177ff48a7197bee7eeb08f4e81b9d0ce8db271/src/plugins/intel_cpu/tests/functional/custom/single_layer_tests/classes/eltwise.cpp#L291) test, the test must fail.\n* If test doesn't fail then add supported operation in [CPU eltwise test instantiation](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/0a177ff48a7197bee7eeb08f4e81b9d0ce8db271/src/plugins/intel_cpu/tests/functional/custom/single_layer_tests/classes/eltwise.cpp#L338) if it's absent.\n\n### Tests\nTests are disabled in default build, so ensure to add `-DENABLE_TESTS=ON` into cmake command during the project configuration.\n\n[GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest) is used for testing.

When creating a new knowledge base, the generated URL is incorrect ??? the basePath appears twice.\n\nAfter reviewing the commits, I found that in commit [db20f9b](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/commit/db20f9b), the relevant tag was changed from <a> to <Link>, and at the same time, ${basePath} was manually added to the href.\n\n<img width=\"1442\" height=\"595\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/696cf519-7579-4e04-aba8-3cf859175b21\" />\n\nHowever, according to the Next.js documentation ([basePath](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/basePath)), the <Link> component automatically prepends the basePath, so there???s no need to add it manually. I guess this might have introduced a bug.\n\n### ?????? Expected Behavior\n\nIn version 1.4.1, when clicking the \"Create Knowledge Base\" button, the user is correctly redirected to: `http://192.168.24.150/dify/datasets/create` , this is a correct behavior\n\n### ??? Actual Behavior\n\nIn version 1.6.0, clicking the same \"Create Knowledge Base\" button redirects to: `http://192.168.24.150/dify/dify/datasets/create`",

Bug fixes and security updates can change behavior that technically \"breaks\" user code, but they are not considered major revisions.\n\nIf a change forces us to modify existing tests, that's a good indication that it may deserve a major version bump, but even then, if the behavior is undocumented, it's really at our discretion whether we think it makes sense to do so.\n\nIn this case:\n - Our documentation clearly states support for \"latest browsers\".\n - Safari 17.4 is more than a year old and isn't even within the 18.x range.\n - We have not changed our API contract. If we did, that would be a major version bump.\n - The implementation details of how signals are combined is undocumented.\n - The change was made as a bug fix for a memory leak.\n\nAlso, perhaps most importantly, our current testing infrastructure doesn't give us the ability to run regression tests against old browsers. We could potentially integrate BrowserStack to do something like that. I am open to it if someone sends a PR. That would at least make it easier to be aware of the situation, regardless of whether we decide to officially change our support policy.", "Got it.", "Unfortunately, `AbortSignal.any` is not easily polyfill-able b/c it requires `WeakRef`. See https://github.com/zloirock/core-js/issues/445#issuecomment-1817361034\n\nIn light of that perhaps it's worth not using `AbortSignal.any` until browser support is better? @sindresorhus ", "Safari has had `WeakRef` for even longer, since v14.1, which was released in April, 2021. This shouldn't be an issue for most people.\n\nThat said, if you need it, I would be happy to provide commercial support and discuss options for solving edge cases like this.", "Also encountered this issue for visitors with older browsers that are not easy to update, mostly iOS devices.\n\nDowngraded for now. But it's a bit sad that a minor bump caused this.", "The support policy for almost all of your browser-based dependencies is going to be \"latest and latest - 1\". So if you haven't run into something like this with other libraries, you've just gotten lucky so far. It's a result of the fast pace of browser development along with most browsers using auto-update.\n\nThat said, I think it's perfectly valid to want more. It would be nice to at least not accidentally and unknowingly upgrade our minimum working browser version, regardless of what we officially support. To do that, we would really need the ability to pin to a specific browser version in our test suite, like we do for Node.js versions. Alternatively, we could use lint rules for the same purpose. A PR for that would be very welcome.", "> The support policy for almost all of your browser-based dependencies is going to be \"latest and latest - 1\".

I think it's very reasonable to limit support on free and open source projects.\n\nIn our case the polyfills are handled by nextjs, but unfortunately they don't provide a polyfill for Abort signal.any so that's pretty unfortunate.\n\nGood idea with the linting, I might look into it and create a PR.\n\nThanks for your time.", "Took a look at https://github.com/amilajack/eslint-plugin-compat and it seems pretty fitting.

Please describe.**\nStarting in `v7.10.0`, all subviews have a thin border/outline around them to make it easily distinguishable from other elements on the form. We have received feedback from some users that this is not always desirable, for instance when you have a subview within a larger subview, or when the headings clearly separate portions of the form. Some have mentioned they simply prefer the look without them and understand the implications of not clearly segmenting each table. \n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nOne of two solutions would be acceptable, with the first one being **preferred**.\n\n1.

Please note that if the bug-related issue you submitted lacks corresponding environment info and a minimal reproducible demo, it will be challenging for us to reproduce and resolve the issue, reducing the likelihood of receiving feedback.\n- [ ] 4. If the issue you raised is not a bug but a question, please raise a discussion at https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/discussions/new/choose Otherwise, it will be closed.\n- [ ] 5. Please use English, otherwise it will be closed.\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nThe GPU memory usage when serving Kimi VL is too high.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n1. First monitor GPU memory usage using `nvitop`\n2. Launch server with `python -m sglang.launch_server --model-path moonshotai/Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 --trust-remote-code --reasoning-parser kimi --mem-fraction-static 0.5`\nThe usage should be around 50%.\n3. Run `python benchmark/mmmu/bench_sglang.py --port 30000 --concurrency 8` in sglang.\n4. Continue monitoring the memory usage, it would up to 98%, and sometimes cause OOM\n\n### Environment\n\nPython: 3.10.12 (main, May 27 2025, 17:12:29) [GCC 11.4.0]\nCUDA available: True\nGPU 0,1,2,3: NVIDIA H100 80GB HBM3\nGPU 0,1,2,3 Compute Capability: 9.0\nCUDA_HOME: /usr/local/cuda\nNVCC: Cuda compilation tools, release 12.4, V12.4.131\nCUDA Driver Version: 550.127.05\nPyTorch: 2.7.1+cu126\nsglang: 0.4.7.post1\nsgl_kernel: 0.1.9\nflashinfer_python: 0.2.6.post1\ntriton: 3.3.1\ntransformers: 4.52.3\ntorchao: 0.9.0\nnumpy: 2.2.5\naiohttp: 3.11.18\nfastapi: 0.115.12\nhf_transfer: 0.1.9\nhuggingface_hub: 0.30.2\ninteregular: 0.3.3\nmodelscope: 1.25.0\norjson: 3.10.16\noutlines: 0.1.11\npackaging: 25.0\npsutil: 7.0.0\npydantic: 2.11.3\npython-multipart: 0.0.20\npyzmq: 26.4.0\nuvicorn: 0.34.2\nuvloop: 0.21.0\nvllm: Module Not Found\nxgrammar: 0.1.19\nopenai: 1.76.0\ntiktoken: 0.9.0\nanthropic: 0.50.0\nlitellm: 1.67.4.post1\ndecord: 0.6.0\nNVIDIA Topology: \n        GPU0    GPU1    GPU2    GPU3    GPU4    GPU5    GPU6    GPU7      CPU Affinity    NUMA Affinity   GPU NUMA ID\nGPU0     X      NV18    NV18    NV18    NV18    NV18    NV18    NV18      0-47,96-143     0               N/A\nGPU1    NV18     X      NV18    NV18    NV18    NV18    NV18    NV18      0-47,96-143     0               N/A\nGPU2    NV18    NV18     X      NV18    NV18    NV18    NV18    NV18      0-47,96-143     0               N/A\nGPU3    NV18    NV18    NV18     X      NV18    NV18    NV18    NV18      0-47,96-143     0               N/A\nGPU4    NV18    NV18    NV18    NV18     X      NV18    NV18    NV18      48-95,144-191   1               N/A\nGPU5    NV18    NV18    NV18    NV18    NV18     X      NV18    NV18      48-95,144-191   1               N/A\nGPU6    NV18    NV18    NV18    NV18    NV18    NV18     X      NV18      48-95,144-191   1               N/A\nGPU7    NV18    NV18    NV18    NV18    NV18    NV18    NV18     X        48-95,144-191   1               N/A\n\nLegend:\n\n  X    = Self\n  SYS  = Connection traversing PCIe as well as the SMP interconnect between NUMA nodes (e.g., QPI/UPI)\n  NODE = Connection traversing PCIe as well as the interconnect between PCIe Host Bridges within a NUMA node\n  PHB  = Connection traversing PCIe as well as a PCIe Host Bridge (typically the CPU)\n  PXB  = Connection traversing multiple PCIe bridges (without traversing the PCIe Host Bridge)\n  PIX  = Connection traversing at most a single PCIe bridge\n  NV#  = Connection traversing a bonded set of # NVLinks\n\nHypervisor vendor: KVM\nulimit soft: 1048576",

It keeps trying to push new channels or videos into my recommendation, no matter how many times i try to correct the issue.\n\n??? _SOLUTION_:    Finding a way to filter recommendations, such as blocking recommendations from channels under certain viewer counts or from channels you aren't subscribed to.\n<!-- (Describe what you'd like \n          (A clear and concise description of what you want to happen). \n           Please consider screenshots or sketches if it makes sense)-->\n\n ??? _ALTERNATIVES_:  You could also allow for filtering by blocking all recommended videos except for certain whitelisted channels, but that could be kinda limiting as users would have to keep the whitelist updated, which could be a hassle and wouldn't really work for music.\n<!-- (Describe what you've considered: \n      Alternative solutions or features, you'd consider as equal or inferior). -->\n\n ??? _RELEVANCE / SCOPE_: I've seen a lot of people have similar issues to varying degrees, and haven't seen anyone find a way to prevent this for long.\n<!-- (Would this be good by for everybody by default? (hypothetically). \n          Estimate how many percent of our users (or all youtube users) should/would use your idea? ) -->\n\n??? _\"SIDE EFFECTS\"_:   This may prevent users from discovering new channels they like or may stunt the growth of growing channels, but it wouldn't have to be a feature that's on by default, just something for those of us not looking for new content at the moment. It could also, depending on how it's implemented, conflict with certain music artists and songs on the platform that may not be from channels users are subscribed to.\n<!-- (Is there any conflict with any other feature? \n           Who might NOT want this?(How many percent of users could be bothered by it even filling space in our menu?)--> \n\n??? _CONTEXT_:       <!-- any other context. -->\n// \n Thank  you!\n\nSHORT Table | (Summary)     \n------------ | -------------   \n*Problem*     |     Algorithm is kinda fucked, recommendations are off                              \n*Solution*     |     Ability to filter recommendations by channel or views                                                       <!-- TYPE HERE, 1 line each) -->         \n*Alternatives*|    Filter based on whitelist     \n*Scope*         |     Varies      \n*Side effects*|     Could impact small channels or those who use YouTube for Music   \n*Context*      |\n",

      "repositoryName" : "kubernetes-client/java",
      "description" : "**Describe the bug**\nIn the `GenericKubernetesApi.java` file, the private method `makeClusterCreateCallBuilder` incorrectly builds the API call for creating a cluster-scoped resource.\nIt mistakenly calls the `.dryRun()` method twice, with the second call incorrectly passing the `fieldManager` value from `CreateOptions`. This overwrites the actual `dryRun` value and fails to set the `fieldManager` parameter.\n\nHere is the problematic code snippet:\n// in [/util/src/main/java/io/kubernetes/client/util/generic/GenericKubernetesApi.java](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/java/blob/v24.0.0/util/src/main/java/io/kubernetes/client/util/generic/GenericKubernetesApi.java)\n```java\n  private CallBuilder makeClusterCreateCallBuilder(\n      ApiType object, final CreateOptions createOptions) {\n    return () ->\n        customObjectsApi.createClusterCustomObject(\n            this.apiGroup,\n            this.apiVersion,\n            this.resourcePlural,\n            object)\n                .dryRun(createOptions.getDryRun())\n                .dryRun(createOptions.getFieldManager())\n                .buildCall(null);\n  }\n```\n\nThe second .dryRun() call should be .fieldManager().\n\n\n**Client Version**\ne.g. `24.0.0`\n\n**Kubernetes Version**\ne.g. `1.30.13`\n\n**Java Version**\ne.g. Java 21\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n1. Instantiate `GenericKubernetesApi` for a cluster-scoped custom resource.\n2. Create an instance of `CreateOptions` with a specific `fieldManager` value (e.g., \"`my-app-controller`\").\n3. Call the `api.create(customObject, createOptions)` method.\n4. Observe the HTTP request sent to the Kubernetes API server.\n5. You will see that the request includes a `dryRun=my-app-controller` parameter, and the `fieldManager` parameter is missing.\n\n**Expected behavior**\nThe API call builder should correctly map the options. The `dryRun` value from `CreateOptions` should be used for the `dryRun` parameter, and the `fieldManager` value should be used for the `fieldManager` parameter.\n\n**Server (please complete the following information):**\n - OS: MacOS 15.2\n - Environment : Docker Desktop & IDE\n\n**Additional context**\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\n",
