Upon receiving the content, `dfdaemon` writes the file to its configured storage location.\n\n### Link\n\nClient Repo: https://github.com/dragonflyoss/client",

This improvement is crucial for optimizing blob downloads from Harbor.\n\nCurrently, when Dragonfly downloads blobs from Harbor using the provided Blobs URL, it initiates Range requests based on the Piece Length. However, Harbor's Blobs URL often redirects to an object storage URL, resulting in frequent 307 (Temporary Redirect) responses. Without proper handling of the Cache-Control header, Dragonfly repeatedly sends requests to Harbor, leading to increased load and inefficiency.\n\n#### Problem:\nHarbor Blobs URLs trigger multiple 307 redirects to object storage URLs.\nThe backend HTTP client does not currently respect Cache-Control directives, which could otherwise reduce redundant requests to Harbor by caching redirect responses or respecting no-cache directives.\nProposed Solution:\nImplement support for HTTP 301 and 307 redirects in Dragonfly's backend HTTP client.\nEnsure the client adheres to the Cache-Control header logic during redirects, such as caching redirect locations when allowed or avoiding caching when instructed (e.g., no-cache or no-store).\nOptimize Range requests to minimize unnecessary interactions with Harbor by leveraging cached redirect information when appropriate.\n\n#### Expected Benefits:\nReduced number of requests to Harbor due to proper handling of cached redirect responses.\nImproved download performance and efficiency for blobs redirected to object storage.\nBetter compliance with HTTP standards for redirects and caching.\nAdditional Context:\nThis feature is particularly important for scenarios involving Harbor and object storage integrations, where redirects are common.\nThe implementation should handle edge cases such as invalid or missing Cache-Control headers and ensure that Range requests continue to function correctly after redirects.\n\n#### Task:\nUpdate the HTTP client in Dragonfly to handle 301 and 307 redirects.\nImplement logic to parse and respect Cache-Control headers during redirects.\nAdd relevant tests to verify correct behavior for redirect caching and Range requests.\nDocument the behavior and any configuration options for users.\n\n#### Link:\n- Backend HTTP Client: https://github.com/dragonflyoss/client/blob/main/dragonfly-client-backend/src/http.rs",

I’ve been exploring CARE and love how it’s transforming healthcare management. With my background in ReactJS and Django (e.g., I optimized a React app to handle large datasets at Modern Vibe Homes), I’d love to tackle this and make those tables sing with all the data they deserve!\n\nHere’s how I’d crush it:\n\n1. **Diagnose the Limit**: Dig into the backend (likely Django) to confirm the 14-item cap—probably a pagination default in the API.\n2. **Boost the Fetch**: Update the API endpoint to support dynamic limits (e.g., `?limit=50`) or fetch all items with a single call if feasible.\n3. **Frontend Flow**: Tweak the React frontend to handle paginated or full data—maybe add a “Load More” button for smooth UX.\n4. **Test the Fix**: Verify with the example encounter ([this link](https://care.ohc.network/facility/605215bd-6215-45dd-bc20-aaeceb474ca1/patient/f3d6590d-adcd-4e0d-9eb3-a5f003dbbee8/encounter/235e330a-4924-4c1a-a871-defead90a16c/updates)) to ensure all allergies show up.\n5. **Polish It**: Optimize performance so it’s snappy even with 50+ items—because healthcare pros need speed!\n\nThis fix could unlock a seamless experience for users tracking tons of allergies or diagnoses—I’m pumped to see it through! Could I take a stab at a PR for this? I’m also eyeing GSoC 2025 with CARE—any chance to chat with the team about this or other ideas?

Insert value with initially 10 digits and go upto possible max extent of bigint. Run the full sync of that db on Parquet Writer. Then run cdc sync. Check value in both the cases.\n\n\n## Expected behavior\nThe value present in db, exactly same value must be written in Parquet writer.\n\n\n",

      "description" : "**Describe the feature you are requesting**\n\nLog entries for the load balancer controller are in JSON format and one of the fields is `level` which contains a severity level. There is a `--log-level` parameter supported as a runtime argument for the tool. However, that log level argument currently only supports setting either `info` or `debug` levels and not `warn` or `error`.\n\nA bug was raised about this in 2021: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-load-balancer-controller/issues/1820\n\nAs far as I can see, the logging remains the same in version v2.11.0 - info level messages are printed to stdout when passing `--log-level=warn`.\n\nThat previous issue describes the situation as follows:\n\n> the log-level flag currently can have only two values - info or debug. If anything else is specified, the debug level gets set on the logger. That is why you see debug logs when you specify level of error [...]\n> \n> [...] due to the limitations of the current logging packages, we won't be able to safely support multiple log levels (other than info and debug) in the short term.\n\nFour years later, I came across this ticket and wanted to ask whether there's plans to change this behavior on the roadmap.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nBeing able to configure verbosity for third party applications like the Load Balancer Controller helps users keep log aggregation costs and query times down.\n\n**Describe the proposed solution you'd like**\n\n* Configurable log levels to include `warn` and `error`\n* Documentation to clear supported log levels clearly\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\nCurrently if needed, my team filters out `info` level messages in our log aggregation tool. However, that either ends up very verbose (if we want a granular approach with per-chart log filtering) or very blunt (dropping those log levels for all applications, when we may want to collect more granular information from one application than another).\n\n**Contribution Intention (Optional)**\n\n-[ ] Yes, I am willing to contribute a PR to implement this feature\n-[x] No, I cannot work on a PR at this time\n\nI would be happy to help investigate options for this, but I don't have any background in go, so I would not be able to commit to implementing this myself.",

      "description" : "**Description:**\nAdd automatic language detection capabilities to Kreuzberg to intelligently select appropriate OCR languages and processing options based on document content.\n\n**Requirements:**\n1. Implement language detection using an existing library (e.g., `langdetect`, `lingua-py`, or `fasttext`)\n2. Add language detection as an optional feature that can be enabled in `ExtractionConfig`\n3. When enabled, automatically detect language and configure OCR backend accordingly\n4. Support detection from both extracted text and pre-OCR image analysis\n5. Add caching for language detection results to avoid redundant processing\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n- Add new optional dependency group `[language-detection]` in `pyproject.toml`:\n  ```toml\n  optional-dependencies.language-detection = [\n    \"fast-langdetect>=0.2.0\",  # 80x faster than langdetect, 95% accuracy\n  ]\n  ```\n- **Library Choice Rationale**: Use `fast-langdetect` based on 2024 benchmarks showing it's 80x faster than alternatives while maintaining 95% accuracy\n- Add `auto_detect_language: bool = False` to `ExtractionConfig`\n- Add `detected_languages: list[str] | None` to `ExtractionResult`\n- Create new module `kreuzberg/_language_detection.py` with detection logic\n- Update OCR backends to use detected language when available\n- Handle `MissingDependencyError` when language detection is enabled but library not installed\n\n**Testing Requirements:**\n- Test language detection with documents in multiple languages\n- Test fallback behavior when detection fails\n- Test integration with each OCR backend\n- Test caching behavior\n- Mock the language detection library in unit tests\n- Add test files in different languages to `test_source_files/`\n\n**Example Usage:**\n```python\nconfig = ExtractionConfig(auto_detect_language=True)\nresult = await extract_file(\"document.pdf\", config=config)\nprint(f\"Detected languages: {result.detected_languages}\")\n```",

This involves updating the block registration for the `woocommerce/add-to-cart-form` block to include a transforms property that allows it to be converted to the new `woocommerce/add-to-cart-with-options` block.\n\nSince the new blockified `Add to Cart + Options` block does not currently use any of the attributes from the classic block, we don't need to pass any attributes during the transform. The transform can simply create a new instance of the blockified block with its default settings.\n\nIf this approach looks good, could you please assign the issue to me?\n\nThanks!" ],

Change to body tab and see that body is gone\n\n**Expected behavior**\nIt should not matter which tab is open while sending a request. Body should not disappear.\n\n**Screenshots/Video**\n\n\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\n - OS: macOS\n - Version v0.1.0\n\n**Additional context**\nIt's possibly due to the request body `MonacoEditor` not being rendered. I think that the request body content is read before sending the request. If the editor is not mount however, there is no body content to send --> empty request body. Should be fixable if we do only save the request body when the body tab is actually currently open or when switching away from the body tab.\n",

The docs website might be a bit (or more) outdated, and we'd appreciate contributions to keep it up-to-date.\n\nWhile we still support direct deployment on the host, we recommend Docker-based deployment as the main way to install Photoview, as it gives perfect abstraction and unification across host OS and architectures. Nothing is ideal, but the Docker deployment is easier to maintain, so the direct deployment on the host is considered an advanced way for users, skilled and ready to solve some dependency and configuration issues, caused by their OS and architecture differences and nuances.", "Thanks for the quick reply, I really appreciate that you took the time to write to me in addition to volunteering to make this project a reality. I've setup \"Dockage\" partly to learn another tool, partly to speed things up by skipping some of the docker-specific commandline. Some of my issues with the timeline were simply filesystem permissions on the host as it turns out, which is a bit embarassing to overlook. However, after resolving the permissions, it also took renaming the folders to get PhotoView to re-synchronize the timeline and eliminate blank images in it. It's working as expected now! \n\nThank you again for the time and effort you put into this completely free and life improving software!\n\nTmanok" ],

Then I found this — clean, functional, and just works.\n\n**One suggestion:**\nWould it be possible to think first, then reply a pre-message, and only after that trigger the MCP? Something like this:\n\nUser: `Show me the last 10 AI news`\nModel (thinking mode): “Alright, the user is asking for tech-related news… let me check if there’s any available MCP for that… found one, now I’ll trigger it.”\nModel reply user right away: Got it — here are the latest AI updates: \n[MCP call]\n\nThis kind of pre-processing — with a message before actually calling the MCP — would make the flow feel smarter and more human-like, especially for models that support thinking mode.\n\nClaude, for example, shows a pre-message before executing the function call:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/adb41e6a-36d2-4b8f-91c1-48e02afc5a52)\n\nIn my tests here, though, it just fires the MCP without expose thinking, and without pre-message, just call mcp immediately, without showing that thought process.", "I’ve left a related comment on #107.\n\nSome level of handling for the `<think>` tag can be done through middleware.\nYou can find more details here:\n[https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/extract-reasoning-middleware](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/extract-reasoning-middleware)\n\n", "> I’ve left a related comment on [#107](https://github.com/cgoinglove/mcp-client-chatbot/issues/107).\n> \n> Some level of handling for the `<think>` tag can be done through middleware. You can find more details here: https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/extract-reasoning-middleware\n\nAre you referring to properly showing the 'thinking mode' UI, or to making the model actually think and send a pre-message before triggering the MCP?", "Oh, I'm sorry. I think my opinion was a bit off because I was using translations due to my lack of English skills.\n\nDoes the issue you mentioned mean that you want to think before executing rather than executing immediately before using the tool?\n", "Sorry, I accidentally mixed two things in the same post.\n\nThere are two separate points here:\n\n1. About the <think> tag not being formatted\nThis was just a formatting issue I noticed with the Together provider.  \n\n\n2. About the execution flow (this is the important part)\nIt’s not a bug, but rather a UX detail that feels off.\n\nRight now, the model executes the MCP immediately after the user request. This feels robotic. The ideal flow would make the interaction more human by adding at least a pre-message before call mcp:\n\n\n\n### Current behavior:\n```\nUser: Generate a video of a flying airplane\n→ MCP call happens immediately\nAI: The video is ready, I made a plane fly as requested.\n```\n\n\n### Ideal behavior:\n```\nUser: Generate a video of a flying airplane\nAI: Sure, I’ll generate the video for you.\n→ MCP call\nAI: The video is ready, I made a plane fly as requested.\n```\n\n### Even better with a \"thinking\" step:\n```\nUser: Generate a video of a flying airplane\nAI: <think>Okay, the user is asking for a video. I have the tools to do this via mcp.video-test. I’ll let them know I’m generating it now.</think>\nAI: Sure, I’ll generate the video for you.\n→ MCP call\nAI: The video is ready, I made a plane fly as requested.\n```\n\n\nBelow I will atach some prints:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea0311aa-687a-4b58-8384-f36fc960a7ed)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eed4f533-df8a-4ff8-a6d0-fce46ffed2a1)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92394f51-a2f4-43c4-8a87-18ba4e35c016)\n\nSummary:\nThe goal is to have a more human-like flow, where the model acknowledges the user's request before triggering the MCP, and optionally includes a <think> step to simulate internal reasoning.\n", "I understand what you said.\n\nActually, it depends on the model. For example, in the case of Claude Sonnet, it often explains how it will use a tool before actually using it. On the other hand, Gemini usually does not use a tool right away unless there is a clear purpose for tool usage, and instead asks for more detailed information first.\n\nHowever, a simple way to apply this to all models is to add a brief comment in the system prompt before using any tool.\n\nAs a temporary measure, I added the following to the project's default system prompt:\n\n```typescript\n  // Tool usage explanation guidelines\n\n  prompt += `\n\n\n\n### Tool Usage Guidelines ###\n\n<tool_usage>\n\n- Before using any tool, briefly think out loud about what you need to do and which tool would help\n\n- Express your reasoning naturally before taking action\n\n- This builds transparency and helps users follow your thought process\n\n</tool_usage>`.trim();\n```\n\n<img width=\"868\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e085cc50-b7f4-41e8-8bc1-a0658c09f2c1\" />" ],

      "description" : "### Checklist\n\n- [x] I have checked [FAQs](https://github.com/fla-org/flash-linear-attention/blob/main/FAQs.md) and existing issues for similar problems\n- [x] My GPU is H100 and I have installed `triton-nightly` built by fla team, and double checked [FAQs](https://github.com/fla-org/flash-linear-attention/blob/main/FAQs.md)\n- [x] Please report this bug in English to ensure wider understanding and support\n\n### Describe the Bug\n\n1. A test was designed using the same input sequence, with two inference modes: the first involves a single full forward pass, while the second splits the sequence into multiple segments for sequential forward passes with manual cache transfer. The test checks whether the outputs of the two modes are consistent.\n2. Three models were tested: GSA, GDN, and RWKV7. The results show that GSA and GDN produced inconsistent outputs, whereas RWKV7 passed the test.\n3. In our training mission, all three models showed normal training loss and static validation results. However, the online testing performance of GSA and GDN fell far short of expectations, with results as poor as those of a random policy. By contrast, RWKV7 demonstrated normal online testing results.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce the Bug\n\n```\nimport torch\nimport fla\nfrom fla.models.gated_deltanet.modeling_gated_deltanet import GatedDeltaNetBlock\nfrom fla.models.gated_deltanet.configuration_gated_deltanet import GatedDeltaNetConfig\nfrom fla.models.gsa.modeling_gsa import GSABlock\nfrom fla.models.gsa.configuration_gsa import GSAConfig\nfrom fla.models.utils import Cache\n\nbsz = 1\nhidden_size = 2048\nseq_len = 1024\nseg_len = 128\nlr = 1.0e-3\nuse_cache = True\n\nseg_num = (seq_len - 1) // seg_len + 1\n\nmodel = \"GDN\"\nif model == \"GDN\":\n    config = GatedDeltaNetConfig(\n        attn_mode='chunk',\n        hidden_size=hidden_size,\n        num_heads=8,  \n        head_dim=int(0.75 * hidden_size // 8)\n    )\n    encoder = GatedDeltaNetBlock(\n        config,\n        layer_idx=0\n    ).to('cuda')\nelse:\n    config = GSAConfig(\n        attn_mode='chunk',\n        hidden_size=hidden_size,\n        num_heads=8\n    )\n    encoder = GSABlock(\n        config,\n        layer_idx=0\n    ).to('cuda')\n\ninputs = torch.randn(bsz, seq_len, hidden_size, device='cuda')\n\ny_full, _,  _ = encoder(\n    hidden_states=inputs,\n    past_key_values=None,\n    use_cache=False\n)\n\nb = 0\ncache = None\n\nfor seg_id in range(seg_num):\n    b = seg_id * seg_len\n    e = min(b + seg_len, seq_len)\n\n    segment_input = inputs[:, b:e]\n\n    y_segment, _, cache = encoder(\n        hidden_states=segment_input,\n        past_key_values=cache,\n        use_cache=use_cache,\n    )\n\n    err = torch.sum((y_full[:, b:e] - y_segment)**2)\n    print(f\"Segment {seg_id}: Error = {err.item()}\")\n```\n\nGot the following Output:\nGDN：\nSegment 0: Error = 0.0023405884858220816\nSegment 1: Error = 1012.900634765625\nSegment 2: Error = 1055.44775390625\nSegment 3: Error = 1116.5162353515625\nSegment 4: Error = 1089.9141845703125\nSegment 5: Error = 1107.427734375\nSegment 6: Error = 1104.24560546875\nSegment 7: Error = 1107.385986328125\n\nGSA:\nSegment 0: Error = 1.5609190313625732e-06\nSegment 1: Error = 3535.44677734375\nSegment 2: Error = 3311.689208984375\nSegment 3: Error = 3273.07568359375\nSegment 4: Error = 3326.33642578125\nSegment 5: Error = 3503.629638671875\nSegment 6: Error = 3420.8076171875\nSegment 7: Error = 3332.25048828125\n\nRWKV7:\nSegment 0: Error = 0.0\nSegment 1: Error = 0.0\nSegment 2: Error = 0.0\nSegment 3: Error = 0.0\nSegment 4: Error = 0.0\nSegment 5: Error = 0.0\nSegment 6: Error = 0.0\nSegment 7: Error = 0.0\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nError close to 0.\n\n### Environment Information\n\n1.

During online testing, we cat 4 tokens (observation, tag, action, reward -> T=4) and inference once.\nMeanwhile, GDN shows better training and static validation scores than RWKV7(fla) and GSA.

Toggling them in settings has no observable effect — both vibrate and popup on keypress remain active regardless of their toggle state.\n\n#### Additional Context\nTo help illustrate these issues more clearly, I’ve attached a short 3-minute video demonstrating the behaviors described above.\n\n#### Attachments\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17fc9738-efec-4be2-8985-493a1c9a2a27\n\n### Device type\n\nSamsung SM-120W\n\n### Versions\n\nAndroid 15, Latest version of scribe",

      "comments" : [ "\n## 方案概述\n\n基于TuGraph Analytics的架构，设计一个增量最小生成树(Incremental Minimum Spanning Tree, IncMST)算法，该算法采用顶点中心计算模型，支持动态图上的增量更新。利用了TuGraph Analytics的增量图计算能力 ，通过顶点中心的计算模型实现分布式MST维护。相比传统的全图重计算方法，该方案能够显著提升动态图场景下的计算效率，特别适用于边更新频繁但变化范围相对局部的应用场景。\n\n算法的正确性基于经典的Kruskal和Prim算法原理，通过分布式Union-Find和消息传递机制实现，能够保证在动态图更新过程中始终维护正确的最小生成树结构。\n\n## 核心设计思路\n\n1. 算法模型选择\n\n采用TuGraph Analytics现有的UDGA(User Defined Graph Algorithm)框架实现增量MST。参考现有算法的实现模式，如增量弱连通分量算法  ，我们需要实现AlgorithmUserFunction接口。\n\n2. 增量MST算法设计\n\n核心思想：\n- 维护当前MST状态\n- 对于新增边：使用Union-Find检测是否形成环，若不形成环且权重更小则加入MST\n- 对于删除边：若删除的是MST边，需要重新连接分离的组件\n- 采用顶点中心的消息传递机制实现分布式计算\n  \n状态维护：\n- 每个顶点维护其在MST中的父节点\n- 维护组件标识符(component ID)\n- 边权重信息\n  \n详细实现方案\n\n1. 核心算法类实现\n\n创建IncMinimumSpanningTree.java类，继承AlgorithmUserFunction接口 。\n\n关键组件：\n\n1. 顶点状态结构：\n```\npublic class MSTVertexValue {\n    private Object parentId;           // MST中的父节点\n    private Object componentId;        // 所属组件ID\n    private double minEdgeWeight;      // 到父节点的边权重\n    private boolean isRoot;           // 是否为根节点\n    private Set<Object> mstEdges;     // MST边集合\n}\n```\n  \n2. 消息类型定义：\n```\npublic class MSTMessage {\n    private MessageType type;         // 消息类型：ADD_EDGE, REMOVE_EDGE, UPDATE_COMPONENT\n    private Object sourceId;\n    private Object targetId;\n    private double weight;\n    private Object componentId;\n}\n```\n  \n2. 算法核心逻辑\n\n初始化阶段：\n- 每个顶点初始化为独立组件\n- 设置自己为根节点\n- 初始化空的MST边集\n  \n计算阶段：\n- 处理边更新消息\n- 执行Union-Find操作维护连通性\n- 更新MST结构\n- 广播组件更新消息\n  \n完成阶段：\n- 收集最终的MST边\n- 输出结果\n  \n3. 系统集成\n\n3.1 函数注册\n\n在BuildInSqlFunctionTable.java中注册新的IncMST函数  ：\n```\n// 添加IncMST函数注册\nregistry.addFunction(GeaFlowUserDefinedGraphAlgorithm.of(\"IncMST\", IncMinimumSpanningTree.class));\n```\n3.2 DSL语法支持\n\n扩展GQL语法，支持如下调用方式：\nCALL IncMST() ON GRAPH my_graph \nRETURN src_id, dst_id, weight;\n\n4. 增量处理机制\n\n4.1 边添加处理\n\n1. 环检测：使用分布式Union-Find算法检测新边是否形成环\n2. 权重比较：若形成环，比较新边与环中最大权重边\n3. MST更新：若新边权重更小，替换最大权重边\n  \n4.2 边删除处理\n\n1. MST边检测：检查删除的边是否属于当前MST\n2. 组件分离：若是MST边，将图分离为两个组件\n3. 重连搜索：寻找连接两个组件的最小权重边进行重连\n  \n5. 消息传递机制\n\n参考现有算法的消息传递模式：\n\n1. 初始化消息：广播初始组件信息\n2. 更新消息：传递边更新和组件变化信息\n3. 同步消息：确保算法收敛\n  \n6. 性能优化策略\n\n6.1 增量计算优化\n\n- 局部更新：只更新受影响的组件，避免全图重计算\n- 缓存机制：缓存MST边信息，减少重复计算\n- 批处理：合并多个边更新操作，减少消息开销\n  \n6.2 分布式优化\n\n- 负载均衡：合理分配顶点到不同分区\n- 通信优化：减少跨分区消息传递\n- 内存管理：优化顶点状态存储\n  \n代码文件结构\n```\ngeaflow/geaflow-dsl/geaflow-dsl-plan/src/main/java/com/antgroup/geaflow/dsl/udf/graph/\n├── IncMinimumSpanningTree.java           # 主算法实现\n├── mst/\n│   ├── MSTVertexValue.java

单元测试\n\n在geaflow/geaflow-dsl/geaflow-dsl-runtime/src/test/java/com/antgroup/geaflow/dsl/runtime/query/目录下创建测试类，参考现有的算法测试模式  。\n\n2. 集成测试\n\n创建完整的增量场景测试，验证：\n- 动态边添加的正确性\n- 动态边删除的正确性\n- 算法收敛性\n- 性能指标\n  \n部署与使用\n\n1. 编译构建\n\n将新增的IncMST算法类编译到geaflow-dsl模块中。\n\n2. 函数调用\n\n通过GQL语句调用增量MST算法：\n```\n-- 在动态图上执行增量MST\nMATCH (a) -[e]-> (b) ON GRAPH my_dynamic_graph\nCALL IncMST() \nRETURN a.id as src, b.id as dst, e.weight as weight;\n```\n\n根据之前的方案设计，我将为您提供增量最小生成树的完整代码实现。基于TuGraph Analytics的架构，我需要实现一个继承IncVertexCentricCompute的算法类。\n\n核心算法实现\n\n1. 主算法类\n\n创建主算法类，参考现有的增量图计算模式： \n\n\n```\npackage

优先处理边提议消息，选择权重更小的边\n        if (oldMessage.getType() == MSTMessage.MessageType.EDGE_PROPOSAL &&\n            newMessage.getType() == MSTMessage.MessageType.EDGE_PROPOSAL) {\n            \n

Union-Find辅助类\n```\npublic class UnionFindHelper {\n    private Map<Object, Object> parent;\n    private Map<Object, Integer> rank;\n\n    public UnionFindHelper() {\n        this.parent = new HashMap<>();\n        this.rank = new HashMap<>();\n    }\n\n    public void makeSet(Object x) {\n        if (!parent.containsKey(x)) {\n            parent.put(x, x);\n            rank.put(x, 0);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public Object find(Object x) {\n        if (!parent.get(x).equals(x)) {\n            parent.put(x, find(parent.get(x))); // 路径压缩\n        }\n        return parent.get(x);\n    }\n\n    public boolean union(Object x, Object y) {\n        Object rootX = find(x);\n        Object rootY = find(y);\n\n        if (rootX.equals(rootY)) {\n            return false; // 已经在同一个集合中\n        }\n\n        // 按秩合并\n        int rankX = rank.get(rootX);\n        int rankY = rank.get(rootY);\n\n        if (rankX < rankY) {\n            parent.put(rootX, rootY);\n        } else if (rankX > rankY) {\n            parent.put(rootY, rootX);\n        } else {\n            parent.put(rootY, rootX);\n            rank.put(rootX, rankX + 1);\n        }\n\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    public boolean connected(Object x, Object y) {\n        return find(x).equals(find(y));\n    }\n}\n```\n6. DSL函数注册\n\n基于现有的DSL架构，需要在函数表中注册新算法\n```\n// 在 BuildInSqlFunctionTable.java 中添加\npublic class BuildInSqlFunctionTable {\n    \n    public static void registerIncMST(FunctionRegistry registry) {\n

This is because Steam’s API uses the server’s public IP address, not the domain name, for health checks.\n\nMy context:\n\n    I have a dynamic IP, so I use a domain name (via dynamic DNS) to always point to my current IP.\n\n    When I enter the domain name in Kuma, the health check fails because Steam tries to use the domain name, not the resolved IP.\n\nExpected behavior:\n\nI would expect Kuma to resolve the domain name to its current IP and use that IP in the request.\n\n### \uD83C\uDFF7️ Feature Request Type\n\nOther\n\n### \uD83D\uDD16 Feature description\n\nPlease consider adding a feature that allows Kuma to resolve a domain name to its IP address and then use that IP when performing Steam server health checks.\n\nWhy this is useful:\n\n    Steam’s API works only with IPs, not domain names.\n\n    For users with dynamic IPs, using a static domain name is necessary.\n\n    This feature would make Kuma compatible with dynamic IP setups while still enabling Steam server monitoring.\n\n\n\n\n### ✔️ Solution\n\nSuggestion:\n\nA checkbox or option like “Resolve domain to IP before request” could be added for relevant monitor types.\n\n### ❓ Alternatives\n\n_No response_\n\n### \uD83D\uDCDD Additional Context\n\n_No response_",

Copy the existing `README.en.md` file to create `README.nl.md` in the same directory (`./doc/i18n/`)\r\n2. Translate all text content from English to Dutch, including:\r\n   - Headings\r\n   - Paragraphs\r\n   - Lists\r\n   - Code comments (if any)\r\n   - Any other textual content\r\n3. Preserve all markdown formatting, including:\r\n   - Heading levels\r\n   - Bold and italic text\r\n   - Links\r\n   - Code blocks\r\n   - Tables\r\n   - Images\r\n4. Ensure all links and references remain functional in the Dutch version\r\n5. Update any language-specific content (e.g., language badges) to reflect Dutch instead of English\r\n\r\n### Additional Considerations\r\n\r\n- Maintain consistent terminology throughout the translation\r\n- Pay attention to technical terms that may have specific translations or may need to remain in English\r\n- If there are any culture-specific examples or references, consider adapting them for a Dutch-speaking audience if appropriate\r\n\r\n### Definition of Done\r\n\r\n- [ ] `README.nl.md` file created in `./doc/i18n/` directory\r\n- [ ] All content accurately translated to Dutch\r\n- [ ] Format and styling match the original English version exactly\r\n- [ ] All links and references are functional\r\n- [ ] Translation reviewed by a native Dutch speaker (if possible)\r\n- [ ] Update project documentation or configuration to include the new Dutch README (if necessary)\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\n\r\n- Original English README: `./doc/i18n/README.en.md`\r\n- [GitHub Markdown Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) for reference on markdown syntax",

We need to add more to cover all the code in vllm-ascend, and there are several principles to follow:\n\n1. The overall file tree should be consistent with `vllm_ascend`\n2. The file name should be the original file name with a prefix `test_`\n3. Use `unittest` framework, make good use of mock\n4. The UTs are all running on cpu node, mock the function related to device to host\n\n### Unit tests need to add\n\n- [ ] |-- test__version.py\n- [x] |-- test_ascend_config.py\n- [ ] |-- test_attention\n- [ ] |   |-- test_attention.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_attention_v1.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_mla_v1.py\n- [ ] |-- compilation\n- [ ] |   `-- test_piecewise_backend.py\n- [ ] |-- core\n- [ ] |   |-- test_schedule_config.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_scheduler.py\n- [ ] |-- device_allocator\n- [ ] |   `-- test_camem.py\n- [ ] |-- distributed\n- [ ] |   |-- test_communicator.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_device_communicators\n- [ ] |   |   |-- test_pyhccl.py\n- [ ] |   |   `-- test_pyhccl_wrapper.py\n- [ ] |   |-- kv_transfer @Agonixiaoxiao \n- [ ] |   |   |-- test_simple_buffer.py https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1531\n- [ ] |   |   |-- test_simple_connector.py https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1531\n- [ ] |   |   |-- test_simple_pipe.py https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1531\n- [ ] |   |   `-- test_utils.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_llmdatadist_connector.py\n- [x] |   `-- test_parallel_state.py   @wangyanhui-cmss https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1460\n- [ ] |-- test_envs.py\n- [ ] |-- lora\n- [ ] |   `-- punica_wrapper @hongfugui\n- [ ] |       `-- test_punica_npu.py @hongfugui\n- [ ] |-- models\n- [ ] |   |-- test_deepseek_dbo.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_deepseek_mtp.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_deepseek_v2.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_qwen2_5_vl.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_qwen2_5_vl_without_padding.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_qwen2_vl.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_qwen3_moe.py\n- [ ] |-- multistream\n- [ ] |   |-- test_base.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_context.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_decorator.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_layers.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_metadata.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_ms_split.py\n- [ ] |-- ops\n- [ ] |   |-- test_activation.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_attention.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_cache.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_common_fused_moe.py\n- [x] |   |-- test_expert_load_balancer.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_fused_moe.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_layernorm.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_rotary_embedding.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_vocab_parallel_embedding.py\n- [ ] |-- patch\n- [ ] |   |-- platform\n- [ ] |   |   |-- patch_0_9_1\n- [ ] |   |   |-- patch_common\n- [ ] |   |   |   `-- test_test_patch_distributed.py\n- [ ] |   |   `-- patch_main\n- [ ] |   `-- worker\n- [ ] |       |-- patch_0_9_1\n- [ ] |       |-- patch_common\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_distributed.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_eagle.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_minicpm.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_multi_step_worker.py\n- [x] |       |   |-- test_patch_sampler.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_spec_decode_worker.py\n- [ ] |       |   `-- test_patch_utils.py\n- [ ] |       `-- patch_main\n- [ ] |-- test_platform.py @zhanghw0354 https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1476\n- [ ] |-- quantization\n- [ ] |   |-- test_func_wrapper.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_quant_config.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_quantizer.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_w8a8.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_w8a8_dynamic.py\n- [ ] |-- sample\n- [ ] |   |-- ops\n- [ ] |   `-- test_rejection_sampler.py\n- [x] |-- test_utils.py\n- [ ] `-- worker \n- [ ] |-- test_cache_engine.py @machenglong2025\n- [ ] |-- test_draft_model_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_model_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_model_runner_v1.py\n- [ ]  |-- test_mtp_proposer_v1.py @machenglong2025\n- [ ] |-- test_multi_step_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_multi_step_worker.py\n- [ ] |-- test_pooling_model_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_worker.py @zhanghw0354\n- [ ] `-- test_worker_v1.py @zhanghw0354\n",

That would have the benefit of keeping the Briefcase docs on the Briefcase page, but would ensure that multiple versions say aligned.", "Thinking out loud....\r\n\r\nWhat if we leverage git submodules?\r\n\r\nIn this way, a new repo would contain the common documentation and the project repos would add this new repo as a submodule; then the docs could be built using a single source of truth for common documentation.\r\n\r\nFor instance: https://github.com/davidfischer/sphinx-with-submodules", "Put together a quick PoC.\r\n\r\nIn a [copy](https://github.com/rmartin16/briefcase-test) of the Briefcase repo, I added a new [repo](https://github.com/rmartin16/beeware-common-docs-test) as a [submodule](https://github.com/rmartin16/briefcase-test/tree/main/docs) in the `docs` directory. Then, I [reference](https://github.com/rmartin16/briefcase-test/blob/467fafe36679c579c0400f20603654295785e2a1/docs/index.rst?plain=1#L18) the `common-1.rst` file from the Briefcase's `index.rst`.\r\n\r\nproject repo: https://github.com/rmartin16/briefcase-test\r\ncommon doc repo: https://github.com/rmartin16/beeware-common-docs-test\r\n\r\nThis all works rather seamlessly, IMO. There will need to be a workflow to bump the submodule commit in the project repos when the common doc repo is updated, though.\r\n\r\n[edit] I guess a major issue this is likely to create is unaware contributors trying to build docs without the submodule....since `git` apparently doesn't clone submodules by default. So, anyone trying to build docs will need to run `git submodule update --init` or have run `git clone --recurse-submodules` initially...", "> What if we leverage git submodules?\r\n\r\nThat's definitely one way to avoid reproducing content; I'm not sure how I feel about it, though. I've historically avoided submodules unless I absolutely have to use them - I've found them to be one of those features that superficially works, but ends up making your life a whole lot more complicated in the long run (especially for contributors that haven't got experience with submodules - which is most of them).\r\n\r\nAt the risk of re-inventing the wheel - I wonder if it might be more reliable to use the same general approach, but build the subrepo cloning part as a build pre-processing step using regular git cloning.", "> I've found them to be one of those features that superficially works, but ends up making your life a whole lot more complicated in the long run (especially for contributors that haven't got experience with submodules - which is most of them).\r\n\r\nThis is fair and definitely one of my concerns for a submodule.\r\n\r\n> At the risk of re-inventing the wheel - I wonder if it might be more reliable to use the same general approach, but build the subrepo cloning part as a build pre-processing step using regular git cloning.\r\n\r\nhmm...this definitely ventures in to wheel reinvention territory.\r\n\r\nWhile this approach avoids the submodule, it introduces ambiguities that the submodule makes explicit. Notably, the current version of the \"common docs\" incorporated in to any single project's published docs is implicit. Now, we can create workflows around ensuring any updates committed to the \"common docs\" are more or less immediately pushed to dependent repos....but that doesn't remove the inherent implicit nature of which version of the \"common docs\" is being used.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if we're willing to automate the management of pulling and building docs from a remote repo, then it seems much more trivial to simply have `tox` ensure the submodule is initialized and updated prior to building the docs....rather than trying to manually clone a repo and add it to the project's docs.\r\n\r\nBut, even then, the \"common docs\" commit used for the submodule in a project repo still needs to be maintained. So, either way, we need a process to ensure updates in the \"common docs\" are disseminated to relevant repos and their docs are republished.\r\n\r\nGiven the submodule is only necessary to build the docs...and the only real way to build the docs is to run `tox`, I think much of the concern of contributors getting caught up in having to understand submodules can be avoided. That said, I don't have strong feelings and don't have much experience managing a submodule over time.", "> > At the risk of re-inventing the wheel - I wonder if it might be more reliable to use the same general approach, but build the subrepo cloning part as a build pre-processing step using regular git cloning.\r\n> \r\n> hmm...this definitely ventures in to wheel reinvention territory.\r\n> \r\n> While this approach avoids the submodule, it introduces ambiguities that the submodule makes explicit.\r\n\r\nThat would depend a bit on the implementation - we could make our implementation use specific git hash or similar. However, at the very least, a non-trivial re-implementation of a not-insignificant portion of git submodules would be required.\r\n\r\n> Given the submodule is only necessary to build the docs...and the only real way to build the docs is to run `tox`, I think much of the concern of contributors getting caught up in having to understand submodules can be avoided. \r\n\r\nThat's a fair point. My experience is that the core git submodule implementation \"works\" - it's just near-impossible for a normal human to consistently drive correctly. These problems stem from the fact that submodules aren't deeply integrated into the \"default\" git workflow, so you end up with stale checkouts, or incompatible checkouts, or something else like that. \r\n\r\nIf we can make the existence of the submodules completely transparent to the end user - so running `tox e docs/docs-lint/docs-live` *completely* manages submodule cloning, updating, etc; and the existence of the submodule doesn't impact on any other development behavior (e.g., causing issues switching between branches), then this might be an approach worth pursuing.\r\n", "A sync between the Toga and Briefcase contribution guides is in progress. \n\nThere is a somewhat significant amount of duplicated content between the two code contribution guides, and the documentation guides are 99.9% the same. I feel the idea of consolidating content is a discussion worth continuing.\n\nI put some time into looking into whether there were any options, inherent to Sphinx, available for consolidating content. As far as I can tell, Sphinx does not support any features that would do this natively. Directly cloning the repo would avoid submodules, but the issue of being able to edit the common docs in the wrong location seems as possible with this method as with submodules. Other than this issue, the rest could be made relatively transparent to the user.\n\nAnother issue that came up is searchability. Users have reported that it's difficult to find info with the docs being spread across multiple repos. Something that is worth looking into for this are [Read the Docs subprojects](https://docs.readthedocs.com/platform/stable/subprojects.html). This would require having a \"primary\" documentation repo, perhaps on `beeware/beeware`, that the rest of the tools are added to as subprojects. Then, the docs would be searchable across all projects - the project-wide search is available from the \"primary\" project, as well as any of the subprojects. The search has a checkbox for \"Include subprojects\" and that is how you choose to search all the projects at once - there is an [active issue](https://github.com/readthedocs/addons/issues/22) open to add the ability to configure it to be checked by default. This change may effect some of the plan [here](https://github.com/beeware/beeware/discussions/522#discussioncomment-13502604), so it's something we would need to discuss. ", "> Another issue that came up is searchability. Users have reported that it's difficult to find info with the docs being spread across multiple repos.\n\nOnce the docs are all moved to beeware.org subdomains, it'll become possible to do this with an external search engine that supports filtering by domain, e.g. Google has `site:beeware.org`.", "> Once the docs are all moved to beeware.org subdomains, it'll become possible to do this with an external search engine that supports filtering by domain, e.g. Google has `site:beeware.org`.\n\nTrue, but that's less convenient than having that functionality built-in.

Thanks!", "Hi @23f2002348 you can always work on any issue in the repository and it is very much appreciated!", "This is weird -- we shouldn't be calling the /feedback endpoint at all when the front end is not running in SASS mode \uD83E\uDD14", "@openhands according to `@xingyaoww`, we shouldn't be calling the feedback endpoint at all when the frontend is not running in SAAS mode. Is there a missing check somewhere in the codebase?", "This issue appears **straightforward** with a clear root cause, though it reveals an interesting architectural concern that needs investigation.\n\n## What's Clear\n\nThe error is very specific - the frontend is trying to access feedback routes (`/feedback/conversation/{id}/{messageId}`) that don't exist in the router configuration. The stack trace shows this is happening during local development using `make build && make run`, and multiple conversation/message combinations are failing with the same pattern.\n\nThe most telling detail comes from the comments: according to xingyaoww, these feedback endpoints shouldn't be called at all when not running in SAAS mode. This suggests the real issue isn't missing routes, but rather **missing conditional logic** that should prevent these calls in the first place.\n\n## Technical Factors\n\nThe fix likely involves finding where the frontend code makes these feedback-related requests and adding proper environment checks. This could be in:\n- Component lifecycle methods or event handlers\n- Navigation logic that automatically triggers feedback flows\n- State management that assumes feedback functionality is always available\n\nThe challenge level depends on how deeply embedded these calls are and whether there's already a pattern for SAAS mode detection in the codebase.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. **Search the codebase** for references to `/feedback/conversation` to identify where these requests originate\n2. **Locate the SAAS mode detection logic** - there should be existing patterns for conditional features\n3. **Wrap the feedback calls** with appropriate environment checks\n4. **Test in both modes** to ensure feedback works in SAAS and is properly disabled in local development\n\nThe contributor who offered to add the missing routes has the right instinct to help, but based on the maintainer feedback, the solution is likely preventing the calls rather than adding the endpoints.", "I'm on it! neubig can [track my progress at all-hands.dev](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/38804ce3f85b4760935cc7d437aae2b6)" ],

This feature is utilized in the `handle_web_search_node` to perform web searches. The `TavilySearchTool` class in `backend/app/agents/devrel/tools/search_tool.py` directly interacts with the Tavily API. The dependency on Tavily is also specified in the project's dependencies. This migration is intended to replace Tavily Search with DuckDuckGo Search as the primary web search provider.\n\n## \uD83C\uDFAF Expected Outcome\nUpon completion, the project will use DuckDuckGo Search for all web search queries. The `langchain-tavily` and `tavily-python` dependencies will be removed from the project, and a new dependency for a DuckDuckGo search library will be added. The `handle_web_search_node` and the search tool will be updated to use the new DuckDuckGo search functionality.\n\n## \uD83D\uDCF7 Screenshots and Design Ideas\nN/A (This is a backend implementation change with no direct UI impact).\n\n## \uD83D\uDCCB Additional Context\nThe following files will be impacted by this change:\n- `backend/app/agents/devrel/tools/search_tool.py`: The `TavilySearchTool` class will need to be replaced with a new class for DuckDuckGo search.\n- `backend/app/agents/devrel/nodes/handle_web_search_node.py`: The `handle_web_search_node` will need to be updated to use the new DuckDuckGo search tool.\n- `pyproject.toml`: The `langchain-tavily` and `tavily-python` dependencies will be removed and a new dependency for DuckDuckGo search will be added.\n- `backend/app/core/config.py`: The `tavily_api_key` setting will be removed and a new setting for the DuckDuckGo API key may need to be added.\n\n### Record\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\n- [ ] I want to work on implementing this feature",

It complements the main GenAI TestLab Architecture Document and the UI/\n...\n## Overall Frontend Philosophy & Patterns\n\nThe frontend for GenAI TestLab will be developed with a focus on creating an efficient, clear, and maintainable interactive workbench for the sole engineering \n...\n```\n\n```text\n  I see you want to create a document at docs/genai-testlab/architecture/front-end-architecture.md. Let me first check what templates are available for document creation.\n\n⏺ Read(../../../../../.bmad-core/templates)\n  ⎿  Error: File does not exist.\n\n⏺ List(../../../../../.bmad-core)\n  ⎿  Listed 2 paths (ctrl+r to expand)\n\n⏺ Let me check the current working directory structure to understand the BMAD setup:\n\n⏺ Search(pattern: \"**/.bmad-core/**\")\n  ⎿  Found 63 files (ctrl+r to expand)\n\n⏺ Perfect! I can see there's a front-end-architecture-tmpl.md template available. Let me read it and use it to create your front-end architecture document.\n\n⏺ Read(../../../../../.bmad-core/templates/front-end-architecture-tmpl.md)\n  ⎿  Error: File does not exist.\n\n⏺ Read(.bmad-core/templates/front-end-architecture-tmpl.md)\n  ⎿  Read 176 lines (ctrl+r to expand)\n\n⏺ Now I'll check if the target directory exists and read the existing file to see what's already documented:\n\n⏺ Read(docs/genai-testlab/architecture/front-end-architecture.md)\n  ⎿  Read 693 lines (ctrl+r to expand)\n⏺ Based on your existing comprehensive front-end architecture document and the BMAD template system, I can see that you already have a very detailed and well-structured\n  document.\n\n  Looking at your existing document, it appears complete and comprehensive, covering all aspects of the front-end architecture including:\n\n  - Overall frontend philosophy & patterns\n  - Directory structure\n  - Component breakdown & implementation details\n  - State management (Zustand)\n  - API interaction layer\n  - Routing strategy\n  - Build, bundling, and deployment\n  - Testing strategy\n  - Accessibility implementation\n  - Performance considerations\n  - Security considerations\n  - Browser support\n\n  Since you have an existing document that's already quite comprehensive, would you like me to:\n\n  1. Enhance the existing document using the front-end architecture template to identify any missing sections or details\n  2. Create a completely new document using the template (which would replace the current one)\n  3. Review and suggest improvements to the current document based on BMAD best practices\n\n  What would be most helpful for your needs?\n> 1\n\n⏺ Perfect! I'll enhance your existing front-end architecture document using the BMAD template to identify missing sections and add valuable details. Let me start by creating a\n   todo list to track this enhancement work.\n\n⏺ Update Todos\n  ⎿  ☐ Analyze existing document against BMAD front-end architecture template \n     ☐ Add missing Technology Stack Table with specific versions and rationale\n     ☐ Add Component Template section with actual code examples\n     ☐ Add State Management Template with concrete Zustand examples\n     ☐ Add API Service Template with actual implementation examples\n     ☐ Add Route Configuration examples\n     ☐ Add Styling Guidelines and Global Theme Variables\n     ☐ Add Component Test Template and Testing Best Practices\n     ☐ Add Environment Configuration section\n     ☐ Add Frontend Developer Standards and Quick Reference\n...\n```\n\nThis time, it doesn't add elicitation questions as it creates the new sections.  It also doesn't reshape the document as aggressively to follow the template - leaving the existing structure mostly intact.\n\nMaybe due to change between 4.20.1 and 4.21.1?  In any case, you can probably close this out to keep the issues tidy.  If anything this issue is related to document transitioning between v3 and v4." ],

I'm [Dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot) and I’m helping the dify team.\n\n<!-- Answer -->\nThe current behavior of the code Interpreter tool is to stop execution and return an error if a code execution error occurs—such as a Python NameError—rather than continuing or providing a partial answer. This is by design and is consistent throughout the codebase: errors are not caught within the tool itself, so when an exception happens, the workflow node is marked as FAILED and processing for that branch stops. There are no configuration options or documented workarounds in the current version to change this behavior.\n\nIf you want the tool to handle errors more gracefully (for example, to return an error message as output instead of stopping), you would need to implement custom error handling in the tool's `_invoke` method or at a higher orchestration level in your workflow logic. For reference, you can see how errors are currently handled in the code execution and workflow engine [here](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/blob/25de39d9c658d1443a8ed566639f0cbc1759f4a7/api/core/helper/code_executor/code_executor.py) and [here](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/blob/25de39d9c658d1443a8ed566639f0cbc1759f4a7/api/core/workflow/nodes/tool/tool_node.py).\n\nIf this behavior doesn't meet your needs, you might consider submitting feedback or a feature request for more flexible error handling in future releases.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

I'm [Dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot) and I’m helping the dify team.\n\n<!-- Answer -->\nThe error \"Process rule pre_processing_rules is required\" means that Dify now expects a list of pre-processing rules to be set when adding documents—including Notion pages—to a knowledge base. These rules define how content is cleaned or prepared before indexing. The allowed rule IDs are: remove_stopwords, remove_extra_spaces, and remove_urls_emails. The default config usually looks like this:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"id\": \"remove_extra_spaces\", \"enabled\": true},\n  {\"id\": \"remove_urls_emails\", \"enabled\": false}\n]\n```\n\nThis requirement is enforced in the backend for all custom and hierarchical process rule modes, not just Notion sync. The frontend should automatically set these defaults, but if something goes wrong (like a UI bug or migration issue), you’ll see this error instead of the page being added [see code reference](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/blob/eb9edf4908d59b410357212e00f93bb2ee6a349e/api/services/dataset_service.py).\n\nIf you don’t see an option to set pre-processing rules in the UI, try refreshing, re-adding the Notion integration, or updating the dataset config if possible. If the problem persists and the UI doesn’t expose these settings, it’s likely a frontend/backend mismatch that needs to be fixed on the platform side. There’s currently no user-facing documentation for this setting.\n\nLet me know if you need more technical details or want to see the expected JSON structure for these rules.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

      "description" : "### Self Checks\n\n- [x] I have searched for existing issues [search for existing issues](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues), including closed ones.\n- [x] I confirm that I am using English to submit this report (我已阅读并同意 [Language Policy](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/1542)).\n- [x] [FOR CHINESE USERS] 请务必使用英文提交 Issue，否则会被关闭。谢谢！:)\n- [x] Please do not modify this template :) and fill in all the required fields.\n\n### 1. Is this request related to a challenge you're experiencing? Tell me about your story.\n\nCurrently, Dify's MarkdownForm component supports various input types (text, number, email, date, checkbox, select, etc.), but lacks support for `type=\"hidden\"` input elements. This limitation affects plugin developers and use cases requiring metadata or session tracking.\n\n**Use Cases:**\n- **Plugin Development**: Need to pass metadata (plugin version, configuration IDs) without user visibility\n- **Session Tracking**: Store session identifiers, user roles, or context information\n- **Form Enhancement**: Include calculated values, timestamps, or system-generated data\n- **Multi-step Workflows**: Maintain state between form submissions\n\n**Current Workaround**: Developers must use visible input fields or complex workarounds, which compromise user experience and security.\n\n### 2. Additional context or comments\n\n**Technical Details:**\n- The MarkdownForm component in `web/app/components/base/markdown-blocks/form.tsx` currently supports these input types: `text`, `number`, `email`, `password`, `url`, `tel`, `date`, `datetime-local`, `time`, `month`, `week`, `color`, `range`, `checkbox`, `radio`, `select`, `textarea`, `file`\n- Hidden inputs should be rendered as `<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"fieldName\" value=\"fieldValue\" />` without any visible UI elements\n- Values should be included in form submissions alongside other form data\n- This is a standard HTML form feature that enhances form functionality\n\n**Expected Behavior:**\n```markdown\n<form>\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"session_id\" value=\"abc123\" />\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"plugin_version\" value=\"1.2.0\" />\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"user_input\" placeholder=\"Enter your message\" />\n  <button type=\"submit\">Submit</button>\n</form>\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- ✅ Enhanced plugin development capabilities\n- ✅ Better session and state management\n- ✅ Improved form functionality without UI clutter\n- ✅ Standard HTML compliance\n- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained\n\n### 3. Can you help us with this feature?\n\n- [x] I am interested in contributing to this feature.",

It needs more testing, I don't feel it's production ready yet, but it might get someone 90% there.\n\nYou also have to download the models manually for STT before it will completely work:\nsudo docker exec -it openwebui-speaches-1 huggingface-cli download rhasspy/piper-voices --include 'en/**/*' 'voices.json'\n\nI'll try to find time to polish it off but if someone else wants to finish it before I have time.... please do so! I have it in word, but it won't let me upload a docx to github.\n\nOne issue I have is I know now that what's below is wrong for volumes (uses /home/ubuntu/.cache/huggingface), so that should be the volume, but I got permissions errors when I ran it last time. I have not figured out how to mitigated that yet ...\n\nI think to make production ready:\n\n- I'd need to figure out the permissions for volume issue (issue with huggingface cache being root vs ubuntu user, I ran chmod 777 on huggingface cache locally).\n- I'd need manually specify the command in the compose.yaml an add the model download (huggingface cache needs to be persistent first so it doesn't download each time).\n- I'd need to figure out a volume map that isn't hardcoded to my user, was playing with /data/speaches-ai but with a sudo docker compose up, it's created as root).\n- I'd need to test it from fresh to make certain everything works as expected.\n\nI also think I had CHAT_COMPLETION_BASE_URL set to my local vLLM instance when I had it working, I didn't think it was used or required so I took it out, but it's an untested configuration change. Basically, yes I have made progress, yes I have it working internally, but I haven't solved all the issues and it requires more steps.\n\n# Speaches.ai Open-WebUI Integration Guide\n\nThe purpose of this guide is to help integrate speeches with Open-WebUI. Moving the processing outside of the Open-WebUI container significantly lowers the CPU utilization and improves UI responsiveness of Open-WebUI. It also allows ability to CUDA accelerating both STT & TTS independently of Open-WebUI.\n\n## Open-WebUI Deployment and Configuration\n\nOpen-WebUI settings are stored in a database, meaning that after deployment the settings persist to whatever the initial default was, or what was provided via environmental variables. Upon initial deployment of Open-WebUI it is possible to already be setup to use the speaches.ai container.\n\n### Pre-deployment\n\n#### Docker Compose\n\nAdd to your Open-WebUI compose.yaml file\n\n```\nservices:\n  open-webui:\n    …\n    environment:\n    - AUDIO_STT_ENGINE=openai\n    - AUDIO_STT_MODEL=Systran/faster-distil-whisper-small.en\n    - AUDIO_STT_OPENAI_API_BASE_URL=http://speaches:8000/v1\n    - AUDIO_STT_OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_OPEN-WEBUI_API_KEY>\n    - AUDIO_TTS_ENGINE=openai\n    - AUDIO_TTS_MODEL=rhasspy/piper-voices\n    - AUDIO_TTS_OPENAI_API_BASE_URL=http://speaches:8000/v1\n    - AUDIO_TTS_OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_OPEN-WEBUI_API_KEY>\n    - AUDIO_TTS_VOICE=en_US-amy-medium\n  speaches:\n    image: \"ghcr.io/speaches-ai/speaches:latest-cuda\"\n    restart: unless-stopped\n    runtime: nvidia\n    volumes:\n    - /home/<YOUR_USERNAME>/.cache/huggingface:/root/.cache/huggingface\n    environment:\n    - NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all\n    - HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN=<YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN>\n    - ENABLE_UI=false\n    - CHAT_COMPLETION_BASE_URL=None\n    - API_KEY=<YOUR_OPEN-WEBUI_API_KEY>\n    - DEFAULT_LANGUAGE=en\n    - COMPUTE_TYPE__USE_BATCHED_MODE=false\n    - OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://open-webui:8080/v1\n    - OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_OPEN-WEBUI_API_KEY>\n    - WHISPER__COMPUTE_TYPE=int8\n    - WHISPER__MODEL=Systran/faster-distil-whisper-small.en\n    - TRANSCRIPTION_BASE_URL=http://speaches:8000/v1/audio/transcriptions\n    - TRANSCRIPTION_API_KEY=<YOUR_OPEN-WEBUI_API_KEY>\n    - SPEECH_EXTRA_BODY__SAMPLE_RATE=8000\n    - SPEECH_BASE_URL=http://speaches:8000/v1/audio/speech\n    - SPEECH_API_KEY=<YOUR_OPEN-WEBUI_API_KEY>\n    - SPEECH_MODEL=rhasspy/piper-voices\n```\n\n#### Docker Run\n```\nsudo docker run -d --name=speaches --runtime nvidia --gpus=all --restart=unless-stopped \\\n-v /home/<YOUR_USERNAME>/.cache/huggingface:/root/.cache/huggingface \\\n-p 8000:8000 \\\n--env “HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN=<YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN>”\n--env \"ENABLE_UI=false\" \\\t\n--env \"CHAT_COMPLETION_BASE_URL=None\" \\\n--env \"API_KEY=<YOUR_OPEN-WEBUI_API_KEY>\" \\\n--env \"DEFAULT_LANGUAGE=en\" \\\n--env \"COMPUTE_TYPE__USE_BATCHED_MODE=false\" \\\n--env \"OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://<OPEN-WEBUI-IP/NAME>:8080/v1\" \\\n--env \"OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_OPEN-WEBUI_API_KEY>\" \\\n--env \"WHISPER__COMPUTE_TYPE=int8\" \\\n--env \"WHISPER__MODEL=Systran/faster-distil-whisper-small.en\" \\\n--env \"TRANSCRIPTION_BASE_URL=http://<SPEACHES-IP/NAME>:8000/v1/audio/transcriptions\" \\\n--env \"TRANSCRIPTION_API_KEY=<YOUR_OPEN-WEBUI_API_KEY>\" \\\n--env \"SPEECH_EXTRA_BODY__SAMPLE_RATE=8000\" \\\n--env \"SPEECH_BASE_URL=http://<SPEACHES-IP/NAME>:8000/v1/audio/speech\" \\\n--env \"SPEECH_API_KEY=<YOUR_OPEN-WEBUI_API_KEY>\" \\\n--env \"SPEECH_MODEL=rhasspy/piper-voices\" \\\nghcr.io/speaches-ai/speaches:latest-cuda\n```\n\n### Post-deployment\nIn Open-WebUI, open ‘Admin Panel:Settings:Audio’.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b65eff1-7b43-44f3-afb4-7b3e157035d3)", "^ This is great and already helped me infinitely in getting my STT+TTS set up. I think OWUI could probably do with some clarity on their end, to indicate to users that the \"OpenAI\" option isn't limited to OpenAI URLs only, but in the mean time this does a great job of walking through the process.\n\nHighly recommend this goes up on the docs site ASAP for new users looking for answers, as this thread took me a while to find.", "Yes, sorry guys. I have made some progress on these issues. One was to specify the user as root so the huggingface cache dir permissions didn't clash with vllm (could just specify another dir for the volume), and another was to change the entrypoint to download the model via huggingface cli && orig entrypoint command. But I'm on a business trip in Germany and just have too much stuff piled up for the moment. After trip ends in early June and I catch up some stuff at home is earliest I can polish it off.\n\nLike I said, if anyone can finish it off earlier feel free to run with it. Honestly not a docker wizard myself. I actually learned a lot setting up a docker compose app w/openweb-ui, vllm for generate and embedding, comfy-ui compiled by source for image generation, and caddy. So some of these problems might be trivial to the right people.\n\nEventually I want to write an entire Open-WebUI guide but I have way too much stuff on my plate right now.", "This isn't working for me...

When I access Prusa Link via Wi-Fi to feed them models, the page shows me a lot of stuff about the printer... *except its name.* I have to check out the IP address to make sure I'm talking to the right printer.\r\n\r\nCan you please just put the name of the printer somewhere on the page? Thanks. \n\n### Expected functionality\n\n_No response_",

But if record changes are not fully propagated, it will wait to read the `rowIter` utils get the exepcted rows.. So, it should throw the exception `Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: table not found in cluster`" ],

      "description" : "### Search before asking\n\n- [x] I searched in the [issues](https://github.com/alibaba/fluss/issues) and found nothing similar.\n\n\n### Motivation\n\nThis issue aims to enhance our Flink connector by introducing support for the `$changelog` auxiliary table. This feature is essential for capturing and processing change data capture (CDC) events seamlessly within Flink streaming jobs.\n\nFluss primary key tables support change data capature to track row-level changes for updates and deletes. When streaming read the primary key table, the flink connector emit records with Flink native `RowKind` (`INSERT`, `UPDATE_BEFORE`, `UPDATE_AFTER`, `DELETE`) to enable stateful computation on changelogs. On the other hand, there are many use cases that users want to consume the plain logs without converting into Flink native `RowKind`. This feature is similar to [Paimon `$audit_log` table](https://paimon.apache.org/docs/0.8/maintenance/system-tables/#audit-log-table), and [Databricks `table_changes(..)` query](https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta/delta-change-data-feed.html#what-is-the-schema-for-the-change-data-feed). \n\n\n\n### Solution\n\n### Implementation\n\n1. `FlinkCatalog` supports `getTable` for `<table_name>$changelog` table path, and the returned table should include additional metadata columns (see following). \n2. `FlinkRecordEmitter` of `FlinkSourceReader` should have a special `FlussRowToFlinkRowConverter` that converts the Fluss `InternalRow` into Flink `RowData` with the additional metadata columns. \n3. `CoordinatorService#createTable` should add validation that whether the created table using system reserved columns (`_change_type`, `_log_offset`, `_commit_timestamp`). \n\n### Schema of the `$changelog` table\n\n| Column Name | Type | Values |\n|--------|--------|--------|\n| `_change_type` | String | `+I`, `-U`, `+U`, `-D` |\n| `_log_offset` | long | the offset of the log |\n| `_commit_timestamp` | TIMESTAMP_LTZ | the timestamp associated when the change was happended | \n\nReference: https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta/delta-change-data-feed.html#what-is-the-schema-for-the-change-data-feed\n\n### Anything else?\n\nYou can take Paimon `$audit_log` implementation as an example: https://github.com/apache/paimon/blob/release-1.0/paimon-core/src/main/java/org/apache/paimon/table/system/SystemTableLoader.java#L69\n\n### Willingness to contribute\n\n- [ ] I'm willing to submit a PR!",

Thank you for your contribution!  It seems that your PR https://github.com/alibaba/fluss/pull/880 has not correctly understood the purpose of this issue. Currently, there are many classes in Fluss that do not reach the 70% test coverage threshold. However, Fluss has a Jacoco coverage check set at 70% during the build process. To bypass this check, we added an ignore entry in the pom.xml file: https://github.com/alibaba/fluss/blob/main/fluss-test-coverage/pom.xml#L247.\n\nOur goal is to improve the test coverage of those ignored classes to eventually remove them from the ignore list, and the purpose of increasing test coverage is to improve code stability. Therefore, when adding tests, it is important to understand the logic of the classes and code, and to add effective tests (UT or ITCase) that align with the code logic, rather than simply adding mock-based tests solely aimed at increasing coverage.\n\nA reference example can be found here: https://github.com/alibaba/fluss/pull/856.\n\nAdditionally, I will create several sub-tasks/issues.

So, my guess is that `distil-large-v3` is not the right name. Also, where do I download the tokenizer for a given model?\n\nI suggest downloading all the models by `make download-models`. It will result in download locally all the models in `Model` folder. \nNext, you have to copy the folder of the model you want to embed inside xcode project. Make sure to copy and not reference the folder, and also select the proper target (your app) on copying the folder. \n\nAlso be sure that the model folder (or any other hierarchy you have in mind) is a _folder_ and not a _group_. This will lead to copying the model folder in the main bundle exactly as it is in your Xcode project hierarchy, and so having the model folder embedded in the main Bundle. \n\nThen something like the example below should work. \n\n```\nlet modelPath = Bundle.main.path(forResource: $PATH_TO_MODEL_FOLDER, ofType: nil)!\nwhisperKit = try await WhisperKit(\n                model: \"tiny\",\n                modelFolder: Bundle.main.path(forResource: modelPath, ofType: nil)!,\n                //omitted options\n\n                download: false\n            )\nlogger.info(\"WhisperKit initialized successfully\")\n```\n\nI've not fully tested, but it seems to load the model properly. Keep in mind that there are limitations on the bundle size to publish the app, so choose the model to embed also based on this\n\n", "Using code similar to the one you provided, I was able to get local models to work. However, I am struggling to get the tokenizer to load locally. Here is the code I am using:\n\n```\nguard let modelFolder = Bundle.main.url(forResource: self.modelFolder, withExtension: nil, subdirectory: nil) else {\n            whisperKitError = \"Could not find model folder\"\n            return\n        }\n        \n        guard let tokenizerFolder = Bundle.main.url(forResource: self.tokenizerFolder, withExtension: nil, subdirectory: nil) else {\n            whisperKitError = \"Could not find tokenizer folder\"\n            return\n        }\n        \n        let computeOptions = ModelComputeOptions(melCompute: .cpuAndGPU, audioEncoderCompute: .cpuAndGPU, textDecoderCompute: .cpuAndGPU, prefillCompute: .cpuAndGPU)\n        let whisperKitConfiguration = WhisperKitConfig(model: \"tiny.en\", modelFolder: modelFolder.absoluteString, tokenizerFolder: tokenizerFolder, /*computeOptions: computeOptions,*/ verbose: true, logLevel: .debug, download: false)\n        \n\n        do {\n            print(\"Initializing WhisperKit\")\n            self.whisperKit = try await WhisperKit(whisperKitConfiguration)\n            whisperKitError = \"\"\n            print(\"WhisperKit Initialized\")\n            print(\"Model folder: \\(whisperKit?.modelFolder)\")\n            print(\"Tokenizer folder: \\(whisperKit?.tokenizerFolder)\")\n        } catch {\n            whisperKitError = error.localizedDescription\n            print(whisperKitError)\n        }\n```\n\nBoth folders exist, but it is still loading the tokenizer from the HF Hub, but failing to save it, as shown in this screenshot, which makes me think that tokenizerFolder specifies where to save a downloaded tokenizer. If I don't provide `tokenizerFolder`, it downloads it from the hub (except when it is already cached). \n<img width=\"654\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c155dea-3bd8-470f-9eae-8f3b608b005c\" />\n\nFor reference, here is what my folder structure looks like:\n\n<img width=\"354\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16574301-34a1-4f70-891a-52dc128c2482\" />\n\nNaturally, I inspected the underlying code and after adding a line of logging to the WhisperKit source code found that it was looking for my tokenizer files in:\n```\n/Models/tokenizers/whisper-tiny.en/models/openai/whisper-tiny.en/tokenizer.json\n\n```\n\nThis is from `ModelUtilities.swift`\n\n```\nlet tokenizerName = tokenizerNameForVariant(pretrained)\nlet hubApi = HubApi(downloadBase: tokenizerFolder, useBackgroundSession: useBackgroundSession)\n\n// Attempt to load tokenizer from local folder if specified\nlet resolvedTokenizerFolder = hubApi.localRepoLocation(HubApi.Repo(id: tokenizerName))\nlet tokenizerConfigPath = resolvedTokenizerFolder.appendingPathComponent(\"tokenizer.json\")\n      \nLogging.debug(\"Looking for tokenizer.json at \\(tokenizerConfigPath.path)\")\n```\n\nSo, it was adding `models/openai/whisper-tiny.en/tokenizer.json` to whatever folder I gave it. Which I found counterintuitive since `modelFolder` checks the exact folder I give it.\n\nThis leads me to ask, what is the appropriate folder structure for the tokenizers and models? Is there a way for me to provide a folder with say all the models (ignoring bundle size) and a folder with all the tokenizer models and just tell WhisperKit which model I want and WhisperKit will automatically pull the appropriate files? \n\nI could not find any documentation for any of this behavior and I was just wondering if it would be useful for me to create some documentation for using models completely offline and put it on this repository. Also, I think to help users debug in the future, it is useful to keep `Logging.debug(\"Looking for tokenizer.json at \\(tokenizerConfigPath.path)\")`. Should I create a PR for it? I also just wanted to bring up that `.path` has been deprecated in favor of `.path(percentEncoded: Bool)`\n", "This is good feedback for the library, the tokenizer handling is divergent enough from the model handling that it would be great to have a unified process that respects the config as expected. Would be awesome to see a PR with the changes that would fit your use case!\n \n- Zach", "@argmaxincbot \nHi Zach,\n\nHere is what I am thinking. In the code that checks for the existence of the `tokenizerFolder` after the additional path is added, if it is not found, it will check just the original path (without the modifications) before throwing the error. Also, for documentation, I am thinking of creating two documentation files, one which documents how to use AudioStreamTranscriber and one that explains how to use models completely offline. For these documents, what is the best format? I was thinking of creating two Markdown files and possibly putting them in a `docs` directory for more formal documentation instead of relying on comments. How does that sound?" ],

All the other Callout options are quite binary whereas this one currently incorporates 3 different types...so splitting them out will allow a person to fine-tune the information they wish to hear. It will increase the panel and require more scrolling for the page...but I think it's worth doing. ", "\nI could also argue that the safety spots callout should remain on unless the user decides to turn all callouts off. In the early days of Microsoft Soundscape, there used to be a toggle switch for the Location Updates callout, but starting around the early 2020's,the Location Updates callout became permanently turned on and cannot directly be configured by the user. My argument to leave safety spots on is so that the user is always aware of anything hazardous while walking around. That way the \"Manage Callouts\" menu wouldn't be cluttered with too many configurations. If we decide to go ahead with my solution, I also wrote a revision to the help documentation explaining \"Note: some callouts essential for safe navigation do not have their own toggle switch and can only be disabled with the \"Allow Callouts\" button.\" Anyway, having all three callouts in this section or just Transportation and Intersections will be an improvement, even for sighted users.

I'm interested in helping out, but I couldn't find any `beman/ranges_and_views` repo in the Beman Organization.", "\n\n> What's the status of this? I'm interested in helping out, but I couldn't find any `beman/ranges_and_views` repo in the Beman Organization.\n\nIt's inactive, so it needs help.  Right now we have any_view and utf_view which are c++29 things --  and they're taking the approach of a single repo per range/view.  So I think that's likely what we should do until we have a big enough collection of range things to put them together -- which sounds like a packaging thing.  So repo named something like `concat_view`.  \n\nSo basically you'd need to clone examplar and do the chore of replacing things. Or if you're adventurous you could test out this thing @ednolan has done.\n\nhttps://github.com/bemanproject/exemplar/pull/179\n\n@wermos I'll send you an organization invite so that *I think* you'll by default have creation privilages for repos in the org", "> [@wermos](https://github.com/wermos) I'll send you an organization invite so that _I think_ you'll by default have creation privilages for repos in the org\n\nDone", "Thanks for the invite, I've accepted it.\n\n> So I think that's likely what we should do until we have a big enough collection of range things to put them together \n\nThat makes sense.

I'll take a look at that PR; it looks interesting.\n\nNow coming to the actual implementation stuff:\nI think I'd like to start with one of the simpler papers (in the first comment in this issue) and not directly get started with `concat`, which was noted to be quite difficult. This will help me get used to the workflow as well as the implementation side of things, which I personally don't have too much experience with yet.\n\nIn particular, `std::views::indices` looks to me like the perfect trial grounds for that.\n\nSo, to that end, if I understood the instructions correctly, I should make a repo called `view_indices`? (I'm not exactly sure what the name should be for this one to allow for maximum clarity.)", "I looked through the `std::views::indices` paper, and to me, it looks too small to me to warrant a repo of its own.", "I did a little research and found that `.` is a valid character in repo names so we should have no issues with making repos like\n- `ranges_and_views.indices`\n- `ranges_and_views.to_input`\n- `ranges_and_views.cache_last`\n- `ranges_and_views.concat`\n\nEven though packaging is further into the future (as in, we can't think about packaging if there's nothing _to_ package \uD83D\uDE04), this _should_ make it easier for a bot or whatever to find and pick up these repos and put them together.", "So this is a bit of a naming bikeshed that we shouldn't get too concerned with because repo names can also be changed later. We have 2 view types and so far they follow the naming pattern of `type_view` -- so `utf_view` and `any_view`.  These names are succint and simple. So for the above I'd suggest `indicies_view`, `to_input_view`, etc. \n\nw.r.t. sufficient size to warrent a repo, I'm certainly sympathetic to that thought -- it feels really heavy for a < 100 sloc project.  But the issue I see, is one might start to wonder why `utf_view` and `any_view` live elsewhere and aren't part of `ranges_and_views`. After all, they are....\n\n> we can't think about packaging if there's nothing to package\n\nreally, that's the key point :) We need an implementation on the ground before anything else really matters.  Everything we're discussing here is changable later...", "> So for the above I'd suggest `indicies_view`, `to_input_view`, etc.\n\nGot it \uD83D\uDC4D. I'll get started with `std::view::indices`.\n\n\n\n", "I would like to give `views::cache_last` a try! ", "@changkhothuychung \n\n> I would like to give `views::cache_last` a try!\n\nGreat! I've sent you an invite for the organization.  That allows you to create or transfer a repo under the umbrella.", "I believe I am done implementing `beman::views::indices`. The implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/bemanproject/indices_view).\n\nI had to do a lot of sleuthing for MacOS because there seems to have been an implementation bug of `iota_view` (which `beman::views::indices` depends on) in LLVM's `libc++`.

It's easier for us to make a review against a pull request.  So for changes in the future I suggest making an issue -- making a branch associated with that issue -- and then a request to merge to main.  Then we can have an interactive review and the CI will check various aspects of things.

However, Apple uses an older version of Clang (v17) in its XCode SDK, so the bug is still showing up. But the bug is fixed upstream (in LLVM). We simply need to wait for XCode to release a version with a recent-enough version of Clang, to remove the workaround I have in place.\n\nI also linked to a [Godbolt example](https://godbolt.org/z/fjbo87MbK) demonstrating the issue in the comments.\n\n> So for changes in the future I suggest making an issue -- making a branch associated with that issue -- and then a request to merge to main.\n\nUnderstood. sorry about that \uD83D\uDE05\n\n> Lol I suppose we haven't written this down!\n\nI think you're right. It would be great if it were written down somewhere so that people don't make the same mistake as me in the future.\n\n> I'll try to have a look over the weekend and provide feedback -- likely in the form of issues if I find things.\n\nGot it.\n\nAlso, I'm noticing that the newer repos (namely `indices_view`, `copyable_function`) are being labeled as Python repos due to the large amount of Python code in `infra/`. I think we need to do some `.git-attributes` tricks to make the repo language show up correctly.", "\n> > I'll try to have a look over the weekend and provide feedback -- likely in the form of issues if I find things.\n> \n> Got it.\n> \n> Also, I'm noticing that the newer repos (namely `indices_view`, `copyable_function`) are being labeled as Python repos due to the large amount of Python code in `infra/`.

This can ensure a 1-to-1 relationship between\r\n   --- arrays upon multiple encoding/decoding of your JSON data with this module.\r\n   ---\r\n   --- If disabled, JSON Arrays will be decoded to plain Lua tables, without the\r\n   --- `cjson.array_mt` metatable.\r\n   ---\r\n   --- ## Example\r\n   ---\r\n   ---```lua\r\n   --- local cjson = require \"cjson\"\r\n   ---\r\n   --- -- default behavior\r\n   --- local my_json = [[{\"my_array\":[]}]]\r\n   --- local t = cjson.decode(my_json)\r\n   --- cjson.encode(t) -- {\"my_array\":{}} back to an object\r\n   ---\r\n   --- -- now, if this behavior is enabled\r\n   --- cjson.decode_array_with_array_mt(true)\r\n   ---\r\n   --- local my_json = [[{\"my_array\":[]}]]\r\n   --- local t = cjson.decode(my_json)\r\n   --- cjson.encode(t) -- {\"my_array\":[]} properly re-encoded as an array\r\n   ---```\r\n   ---\r\n   --- **NOTE:** This function is specific to the OpenResty cjson fork.\r\n   ---\r\n   ---@param enabled boolean # (default: false)\r\n   function cjson.decode_array_with_array_mt(enabled) end\r\n   ```\r\n  \r\n\r\nOne of the solutions could be like this(FYR):\r\n1. `pb.hook` to hook the ouput of `pb.decode`\r\n2. at the hook function, traversal the fields of the `decoded object` recursively\r\n3. setmetatable(`EMPTY_FIELD_WITH_repeated_LABEL`, cjson.empty_array_mt)\r\n", "@wenhaoZhao1997 \r\n\r\nWould you create PR to improve? :D ", "> @wenhaoZhao1997\r\n> \r\n> Would you create PR to improve? :D\r\n\r\nI don't think I have access to the repo， but we fix some code in plugins/grpc-transcode/response.lua , it did well in our environment , and can u review the code and create a pr ?\r\n\r\n```\r\n--\r\n-- Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more\r\n-- contributor license agreements.

I'll work on this issue during the week.", "@FilippoZazzeroni I've added `closure_body_length` to `.swiftlint.yml` and ran the `swiftlint` command, which reported 29 violations. Then, I updated `THRESHOLD_XCUITEST` and `THRESHOLD_UNIT_TEST` in `generate-metrics.sh` from 28 to 57 to match the current violations. \r\n\r\nHowever, to push the dev branch, I'll need to modify the `pre-push` Git hook to bypass it temporarily, as the new warnings cause this step to fail. Does that approach make sense to you?\r\n\r\nInitially, I considered adjusting the `pre-push` logic to check the number of warnings, but the current script isn't set up for that. It only interprets 0 as success and any other value as failure, reflecting the script's exit status rather than the number of warnings.", "Hi @ionixjunior i guess we should go for another path. The task is intended like you did to add the rule to `.swiftlint.yml` and set custom value for the rule in the config yml.

We'll need to configure the error threshold to allow push commits.\r\n\r\nTo address this, we could:\r\n\r\n1.  Set an initial high limit (e.g. 115) and gradually lower it in subsequent PRs as violations are resolved. \r\n2. Start solving the top violations now (in separate PRs) and set a more moderate limit (e.g. 51) to avoid an overly high starting point.\r\n\r\nLet me know which approach you prefer, and I can proceed accordingly.", "Thanks @ionixjunior for the detailed response.

      "repositoryName" : "apache/superset",
      "description" : "### Bug description\n\nWhen configuring dashboard filters with the \"Values are dependent on other filters\" option, the system prevents creating bi-directional dependencies upfront by showing a \"Cyclic dependency detected\" message. However, it allows creating the same dependency indirectly after saving the initial filter configuration.\n\n1. If Filter A is set to depend on Filter B, the system blocks setting Filter B to depend on Filter A immediately, showing a \"Cyclic dependency detected\" message.\n2. However, if Filter A is saved with the dependency on Filter B, the system later allows editing Filter B to create the reverse dependency, effectively forming a bi-directional (cyclic) dependency.\n\nThis behavior is inconsistent and might lead to unexpected filter behavior. It appears to contradict the intended prevention of cyclic dependencies.\nHow to reproduce the bug\n\n1. Create a dashboard filter (e.g., Filter A) with a dependency on another filter (e.g., Filter B) by enabling the Values are dependent on other filters option.\n2. Save the filter configuration.\n3. Open the dashboard filter configuration again, select Filter B, and set it to depend on Filter A.\n4.

Users should not be able to create a cyclic dependency by editing the filters after saving the initial configuration.\n\n## Actual results\n\nThe platform allows creating cyclic dependencies indirectly after the initial configuration, even though it prevents it upfront.

The actions-user bot will reset the file back to previous state for the next contributor after your commit is merged. So you can just simply start working with the issue right away!*\r\n\r\n### How to get started\r\n\r\nOpen the `tasks/html/medium` directory from the root of your project.\r\nThen open the `index.html` file and start implementing your solution!\r\n\r\n![html-medium](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/assets/82566656/1a142585-adc1-40e6-b71e-ee24d63c3882)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe goal of this task is to create a contact form in `index.html` inside the container using HTML. There are also some styles added in `styles.css` but you don't need to modify that code, it is there just for styling purposes.\r\n\r\nThe form should include the following fields:\r\n\r\n-   Name (text input)\r\n-   Email (email input)\r\n-   Message (textarea)\r\n-   Submit button\r\n\r\nPlease note that at this stage, the form doesn't need to submit data to any server-side script. Purpose of this task is to just create the form visually without any functionality.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you are using VS Code and have for example Live Server extension, you can simply open `index.html` with the server and check how the form looks. After the form is done, you are ready to make a pull request!\r\nIf you do not have Live Server extension, you'll find information about installing and how to use it [here](https://www.donskytech.com/visual-studio-code-live-server/).\r\n\r\n*Note: Only the `index.html` file needs modification for this task.*\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions and how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

The actions-user bot will reset the file back to previous state for the next contributor after your commit is merged. So you can just simply start working with the issue right away!*\r\n\r\n### How to get started:\r\n\r\nStart by navigating inside of the directory used in this project with the command:\r\n```bash\r\ncd tasks/react/medium/traffic-light\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen run `npm i` to install Vite, React and all the necessary dependencies for the project.\r\n\r\nAfter installing the dependencies you can open the `src` directory and the `TrafficLight.tsx` file, and start implementing your solution!\r\n\r\n![react-medium](https://github.com/fork-commit-merge/fork-commit-merge/assets/82566656/e154750d-41fd-4db4-bcc6-9dd52c7e55d6)\r\n\r\n### Description:\r\n\r\nCreate a React component using TypeScript that simulates a traffic light. The component should display three lights (red, yellow, and green) and switch between them automatically in the order of a typical traffic light sequence.\r\n\r\n### Requirements:\r\n\r\n-   Implement a `TrafficLight` component in `src/TrafficLight.tsx`.\r\n-   Use TypeScript for type safety.\r\n-   The component should render three circles, colored red, yellow, and green.\r\n-   The traffic light should start with the red light.\r\n-   After a few seconds, it should change to green, then yellow, and then back to red in a continuous loop.\r\n-   Only one light should be \"active\" (brighter) at a time.\r\n\r\nThere are some CSS classes already added for you in the `src/App.css` file, which you can use if you like, or write your own custom CSS.\r\nThere is for example a helper pseudo-class selector for every light that is not active, which will set the light color to gray if the light does not have the `active` class:\r\n\r\n![react-medium-css](https://github.com/fork-commit-merge/fork-commit-merge/assets/82566656/052aaf61-e4d9-40b9-8876-bf96aa2ada9c)\r\n\r\n### Example:\r\n\r\nThe traffic light should cycle as follows:\r\n\r\n-   Red (active) for 4 seconds.\r\n-   Green (active) for 3 seconds.\r\n-   Yellow (active) for 1 second.\r\n-   Repeat the cycle.\r\n\r\n## How to run:\r\nAfter you are done with the card, make sure you are in the `tasks/react/medium/traffic-light` in your terminal and run `npm run dev` to start the Vite server. Then, open \"http://localhost:5173/\" in your browser to check how the app looks.\r\n\r\nIf it looks to be working fine, you are ready to make a pull request!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo work with this issue, you need to have npm and NodeJS installed to your local machine.\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions of installing npm and NodeJS as well as how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Why use Vite?\r\n\r\nThis React project uses Vite for near-instant server start-ups and incredibly fast hot module replacements, providing a smooth and efficient development experience.\r\nAlso Vite requires minimal setup, allowing us to focus on writing React code without getting bogged down in complex configurations.\r\nIf you want to learn more about Vite, check out the documentation:\r\n[Vite Official Documentation](https://vitejs.dev/)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

Fibonacci numbers are a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence starts with 0 and 1.\r\n\r\nYour program should take an input n and calculate the n-th Fibonacci number.\r\n\r\n## How to run\r\n\r\nMake sure that you are in correct directory:\r\n```bash\r\ncd tasks/rust/easy\r\n```\r\n\r\nCompile the program:\r\n```bash\r\nrustc fibonacci.rs\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun the compiled program:\r\n```bash\r\n./fibonacci\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the program works as requested in the task, you are ready to make a pull request!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo work with this issue, you need to have Rust installed to your local machine.\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions of installing Rust and how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

Then follow the instructions and modify the `lib/main.dart` file in that project as requested in the description.\r\n\r\n### Running the app\r\n\r\nYou can run the app several ways:\r\n-   As a Windows/MacOS/Linux app\r\n-   In Google Chrome\r\n-   In Android/iOS virtual emulator\r\n-   In actual Android/iOS device such as mobile phone or tablet\r\n\r\nIn VS Code, you can select from the bottom of the screen how you will run the app.\r\n\r\nThen, make sure you are in the correct directory with this command in Terminal:\r\n```bash\r\ncd tasks/flutter/easy/hello_flutter\r\n```\r\nAfter that you can run the app either pressing `F5` or with the command `flutter run`.\r\n\r\nIf you see the text \"Fork, Commit, Merge\" in the AppBar on the top, and text \"Hello, Flutter!\" in the body, you are ready to make a pull request!\r\n\r\n### Additional Resources\r\n\r\n[Flutter Documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo work with this issue, you need to have Flutter and Dart installed to your local machine.\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions of installing Flutter and Dart and how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

The actions-user bot will reset the file back to previous state for the next contributor after your commit is merged. So you can just simply start working with the issue right away!*\r\n\r\nNavigate to the `tasks/tailwind` directory from the root of the project.\r\nThen install all the necessary dependencies by running `npm i` in Terminal.\r\nAlso just in case, run `npm run watch` to make sure that Tailwind CSS is built correctly every time changes are made.\r\nAfter that you can open the `medium` directory and `index.html` file inside of it.\r\n\r\n![tailwind-medium](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/assets/82566656/a51bcd82-0493-4e6c-932b-af023c187fed)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe goal of this task is to design a responsive pricing table using Tailwind CSS. A pricing table typically displays different pricing tiers or plans for a service or product, with details about each plan. The table should be responsive, adjusting its layout for various screen sizes.\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n\r\n-   Use Tailwind CSS classes for styling.\r\n-   Create at least three pricing tiers (e.g., Basic, Standard, Premium) with different features and prices.\r\n-   Ensure that the pricing table is visually appealing and easy to read.\r\n-   Implement responsive design to adapt to different screen sizes (e.g., mobile, tablet, desktop).\r\n-   Include clear call-to-action (CTA) buttons for each pricing tier.\r\n\r\n### Task Details\r\n\r\n-   Create an HTML structure for the pricing table.\r\n-   Apply Tailwind CSS classes to style the table, pricing cards, and buttons.\r\n-   Populate the pricing tiers with sample data, including plan names, prices, and features.\r\n-   Implement responsive design using Tailwind CSS utilities to ensure the table looks good on various devices.\r\n-   Add hover effects or other interactive elements to enhance the user experience.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you are using VS Code and have for example Live Server extension, you can simply open `index.html` with the server and check how the page looks. After the card is done, you are ready to make a pull request!\r\nIf you do not have Live Server extension, you'll find information about installing and how to use it [here](https://www.donskytech.com/visual-studio-code-live-server/).\r\n\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions and how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

      "description" : "# Fork, Commit, Merge - Medium Issue 1 (C++)\r\n\r\n## Implement a Simple File Reader/Writer Class and Methods in C++\r\n*Note: You don't have ask permission to start solving the issue or get assigned, since these issues are supposed to be always open for new contributors. The actions-user bot will reset the file back to previous state for the next contributor after your commit is merged. So you can just simply start working with the issue right away!*\r\n\r\nNavigate to the `tasks/c++/medium/file_handler` directory from the root of your project.\r\nYou will see four files: `main.cpp`, `FileHandler.cpp`,  `FileHandler.h` and `text-file.txt`.\r\nYou only need to modify `FileHandler.cpp` and `FileHandler.h` files for this task.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description:\r\n\r\nCreate a simple class and methods in C++ to handle reading and writing text files. The class should have the following functionalities:\r\n\r\n-   Read File: Read the content of a given text file and return it as a string.\r\n-   Write File: Write a given string to a specified text file.\r\n-   Append File: Append a given string to the end of a specified text file.\r\n-   File Exists: Check if a file exists at a given path.\r\n\r\n### Requirements:\r\n\r\n-   Implement the FileHandler class in `FileHandler.h` file\r\n-   Implement the FileHandler::ReadFile method, FileHandler::WriteFile method, FileHandler::AppendFile method and FileHandler::FileExists method in `FileHandler.cpp`\r\n-   Do not modify the `main.cpp` or `text-file.txt` files\r\n-   Proper error handling should be done to handle cases where the file does not exist, or other file-related issues occur.\r\n\r\n### Compiling and Running\r\n\r\nTo test the program you have to first make sure you are in the right directory:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncd tasks/c++/medium/file_handler\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen compile the files:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ng++ FileHandler.cpp main.cpp -o filehandler\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen you can run the compiled program by running:\r\n```bash\r\n./filehandler\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected Output:\r\n\r\nThere is a file called `text-file.txt` where you should now see this:\r\n\r\n```txt\r\nHello, World!\r\nAppended text.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this should be printed to the console:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nWrite successful.\r\nAppend successful.\r\nFile content:\r\nHello, World!\r\nAppended text.\r\nFile exists.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the program works as requested in the task, you are ready to make a pull request!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo work with this issue, you need to have C++ installed to your local machine.\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions of installing C++ and how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

The actions-user bot will reset the file back to previous state for the next contributor after your commit is merged. So you can just simply start working with the issue right away!*\r\n\r\nNavigate to the `tasks/solidity/easy/my_simple_storage` directory from the root of your project.\r\nThen open a file called `SimpleStorage.sol` inside `contracts` directory and start implementing your solution!\r\n\r\n### Description:\r\n\r\nCreate a simple Solidity smart contract that allows users to store and retrieve an integer. Deploy this smart contract on a test network and interact with it.\r\n\r\n![solidity-easy](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/assets/82566656/e208a7c7-1307-48dd-a53a-02d927845688)\r\n\r\n### Requirements:\r\n\r\n-   The smart contract should have a function to set an integer.\r\n-   The smart contract should have a function to get the integer.\r\n\r\n### How to run:\r\n\r\nMake sure you are in the right directory:\r\n```bash\r\ntasks/solidity/easy/my_simple_storage\r\n```\r\n\r\nCompile the Solidity file:\r\n```bash\r\ntruffle compile\r\n```\r\n\r\nStart Local Blockchain:\r\n```bash\r\ntruffle develop\r\n```\r\n\r\nDeploy contract:\r\n```bash\r\nmigrate\r\n```\r\n\r\nInteract with Contract:\r\n\r\nYou can interact with your contract from the Truffle development console (it automatically enters this console after you run truffle develop). For instance, to set and get a number using the contract with running these commands one by one:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nlet instance = await SimpleStorage.deployed()\r\n```\r\n```bash\r\nawait instance.set(42)\r\n```\r\n```bash\r\nlet result = await instance.get()\r\n```\r\n```bash\r\nconsole.log(result.toNumber())\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf everything goes smoothly, you should see 42 printed on the console, verifying that your contract is working as expected.\r\n\r\nRemember, this is all happening on your local blockchain provided by Truffle for development purposes. To deploy your smart contract on a live network, you'll have to go through additional steps. This is just for testing purposes for this particular issue.\r\n\r\nIf the program works as requested in the task, you are ready to make a pull request!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo work with this issue, you need to have Node.js, NPM and Solidity (Truffle Ethereum Development Environment) installed to your local machine.\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions of installing Node.js, NPM and Solidity (Truffle Ethereum Development Environment) and how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

      "description" : "# Fork, Commit, Merge - Easy Issue (Rails)\r\n\r\n## Create a Simple \"Hello, Rails!\" App in Ruby on Rails\r\n*Note: You don't have ask permission to start solving the issue or get assigned, since these issues are supposed to be always open for new contributors. The actions-user bot will reset the file back to previous state for the next contributor after your commit is merged. So you can just simply start working with the issue right away!*\r\n\r\n### How to get started:\r\n\r\nOpen the `tasks/rails/easy` directory from the root of your project.\r\nThen start implementing your solution!\r\n\r\n### Objective:\r\n\r\nCreate a basic Ruby on Rails application that displays \"Hello, Rails!\" when visiting the home page.\r\n\r\n### Requirements:\r\n\r\n-   Set up a new Rails application.\r\n-   Generate a controller called Welcome.\r\n-   Create an action index in the Welcome controller.\r\n-   Add a view for the index action that displays \"Hello, Rails!\".\r\n-   Set the route for the home page to point to the Welcome#index action.\r\n\r\n### Instructions:\r\n\r\nFirst, make sure you are in the correct directory:\r\n```bash\r\ncd tasks/rails/easy\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo create a new Rails application, you can use the following command:\r\n```bash\r\nrails new hello_rails\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will create a new directory called `hello_rails` containing a new Rails application. You can then navigate into your new app's directory:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncd hello_rails\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo generate a new controller called Welcome, run:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nrails generate controller Welcome\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter that, you'll want to edit the `app/controllers/welcome_controller.rb` file to add an index action. Then, you'll also add a corresponding view in `app/views/welcome/index.html.erb` that displays \"Hello, Rails!\".\r\n\r\nFinally, you can set the root URL of your application to point to this index action by editing `config/routes.rb`:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nRails.application.routes.draw do\r\n  root 'welcome#index'\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, you should be able to run your Rails application and see \"Hello, Rails!\" when you visit http://localhost:3000. To start the server, use:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nrails server\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo work with this issue, you need to have Ruby and Rails installed to your local machine.\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions of installing Ruby and Rails and how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

The actions-user bot will reset the file back to previous state for the next contributor after your commit is merged. So you can just simply start working with the issue right away!*\r\n\r\n### How to get started:\r\n\r\nOpen the `tasks/ruby/medium` directory from the root of your project.\r\nThen open a file called `text_parser.rb` and start implementing your solution!\r\n\r\n### Objective:\r\n\r\nThe goal is to create a Ruby script that can read a given text file (`example.txt)`, parse its contents, and then perform some basic text analysis on it.\r\n\r\n### Requirements:\r\n\r\n-   Read a text file that is passed as a command-line argument.\r\n-   Count the total number of lines, words, and characters in the `example.txt` file.\r\n-   Identify the 5 most frequently occurring words in the text and display them with their occurrence counts.\r\n-   Identify the 3 longest lines in the text and display them.\r\n-   Include error handling for file not found or unreadable files.\r\n-   Define functions for each of the tasks outlined above.\r\n-   Use Ruby's built-in File class for file operations.\r\n\r\n### Expected output:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nTotal lines: 7\r\nTotal words: 49\r\nTotal characters: 279\r\n5 Most Frequent Words: {\"the\"=>3, \"this\"=>2, \"is\"=>2, \"text\"=>2, \"it\"=>2}\r\n3 Longest Lines:\r\nProbably because it contains every letter of the alphabet.\r\nIt contains multiple lines, words, and characters.\r\nWhy do we use that phrase so often in examples?\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How to run:\r\n\r\nMake sure you are in the correct directory:\r\n```bash\r\ncd tasks/ruby/medium\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun the script:\r\n```bash\r\nruby text_parser.rb example.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo work with this issue, you need to have Ruby installed to your local machine.\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions of installing Ruby and how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

Make sure you are working with right folders and files!\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nYour task is to create a simple Django view that returns a \"Hello, World!\" message to the browser.\r\n-   You have to implement `/hello` path in `hello_world/hello_world/urls.py` file similar as the `/admin` path is implemented.\r\n\r\n![django-easy1](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/assets/82566656/7cb6279c-dac6-4d2a-9eb2-0cff988ef23b)\r\n-   Also, you have to add return statement inside `hello_world/hello_world_app/views.py` file, which will return the string \"Hello, World!\".\r\n\r\n![django-easy2](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/assets/82566656/1ce59ca3-eac2-4439-931f-57ea5799fd31)\r\n\r\n### How to Run:\r\n\r\n-   Make sure you are in `tasks/django/easy/hello_world` directory in your Terminal.\r\n-   Run the development server: `python manage.py runserver`\r\n-   Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/hello/` in your web browser.\r\n-   You should see \"Hello, World!\" displayed on the screen.\r\n\r\n### Before making a Pull request:\r\n\r\n-   Delete the `SECRET_KEY` in the `tasks/django/easy/hello_world/hello_world/settings.py` file. Otherwise when making the pull request, security checks will notice the secret and fail, which is not crucial because it can still be merged, but it just makes the Pull request experience a bit more enjoyable.\r\n- Normally these kind of projects would use something like `.env` file for storing secret keys and passwords etc in environment variables. In this project there is no need for that, since this is supposed to be just for educational purposes.\r\n- Remember, in real life projects, never expose the API keys, secret keys, any passwords or other environment variables to the public repository. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo work with this issue, you need to have Python and Django installed to your local machine.\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions of installing Python and Django. You can also find there instructions of how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

The actions-user bot will reset the file back to previous state for the next contributor after your commit is merged. So you can just simply start working with the issue right away!*\r\n\r\n## How to get started\r\n\r\nFor this task you need to have Python and NumPy installed. Check out [Installing Python](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge#installing-python) section in README if you need to install Python. If you already have Python installed, you can install NumPy using pip (Python's package installer) with the following terminal command:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npip install numpy\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr, if you're using Python 3 specifically and have both Python 2 and Python 3 installed, you may need to use:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npip3 install numpy\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter that you can open the `tasks/python/hard` directory from the root of the project. \r\nThen open `decision_tree.py` file and start working on your solution!\r\n\r\n![python-hard](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/assets/82566656/3fc4a704-a734-4b90-90fc-476ab367b7a1)\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nImplement a Decision Tree Classifier from scratch using Python. Do not use libraries like scikit-learn that have pre-implemented classifiers; instead, use basic libraries like NumPy for numerical calculations.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\n\r\n-   Understand the theory behind Decision Trees.\r\n-   Implement a simple yet functional Decision Tree Classifier.\r\n-   Test the classifier on a dataset.\r\n\r\nUse any freely available classification dataset. Ensure the dataset has at least 3 features and at least 2 classes.\r\n\r\nImplementation Steps:\r\n-   Write functions to calculate Gini impurity or Information Gain.\r\n-   Implement a class DecisionTree with methods for fitting and predicting.\r\n-   Implement a function to print/visualize the tree.\r\n\r\nTesting:\r\n-   Split the dataset into training and test sets and evaluate your classifier.\r\n\r\nAcceptance Criteria:\r\n\r\n-   Successfully implement a Decision Tree Classifier from scratch.\r\n-   Evaluate the classifier on a dataset, showing reasonable performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).\r\n\r\nResources:\r\n\r\n-   [Decision Trees - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning)\r\n\r\n## How to run\r\n\r\nMake sure you are in the right directory:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncd tasks/python/hard\r\n```\r\n\r\nExecute the following command to run your Python script:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npython decision_tree.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected output\r\n\r\nOutput should look similar to this:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nThe predicted class for the sample [0.4, 0.6] is 0.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the output looks correct, you are ready to make a pull request!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo work with this issue, you need to have Python installed to your local machine.\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions of installing Python and how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

So you can just simply start working with the issue right away!*\r\n\r\nNavigate to the `tasks/bootstrap/easy` directory from the root of the project.\r\nThen open the `navbar.html` file to start working with the solution.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFor this task, you'll be adding classes to a navigation bar using Bootstrap's Navbar component.\r\nThe navigation bar is already created to the `navbar.html` file, so your task is to add all the missing Bootstrap classes to make the Navbar look nice.\r\nUse Bootstrap's built-in classes to style the navigation bar.\r\n\r\nAcceptance Criteria:\r\n\r\n-   When viewed on a large screen, all navigation links should be visible in a row.\r\n-   `Logo`-link should be on the left side of the screen and all the other links on the right side.\r\n-    There is no need to add actual logo, it can just be the default text.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you are using VS Code and have for example Live Server extension, you can simply open `navbar.html` with the server and check how the card looks. After the card is done, you are ready to make a pull request!\r\nIf you do not have Live Server extension, you'll find information about installing and how to use it [here](https://www.donskytech.com/visual-studio-code-live-server/).\r\n\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions and how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

The actions-user bot will reset the file back to previous state for the next contributor after your commit is merged. So you can just simply start working with the issue right away!*\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nCreate a TypeScript namespace named Calculator.\r\n\r\nThe Calculator namespace should have the following methods:\r\n-   add(a: number, b: number): number: Returns the sum of a and b.\r\n-   subtract(a: number, b: number): number: Returns the result of a minus b.\r\n-   multiply(a: number, b: number): number: Returns the product of a and b.\r\n-   divide(a: number, b: number): number: Returns the quotient of a divided by b. If b is 0, it should return null (or optionally throw an error).\r\n\r\nEnsure to handle edge cases and provide proper type annotations.\r\n\r\nHints:\r\n\r\n-   Make use of TypeScript's strong typing features to ensure the correct types are being passed and returned.\r\n-   Handle division by zero carefully. You can either return null or throw a custom error.\r\n\r\nAcceptance Criteria:\r\n\r\n-   The calculator must be implemented in a type-safe manner using TypeScript.\r\n-   Each method should work as expected for basic arithmetic operations.\r\n\r\n## How to get started\r\n\r\nFirst, run `npm i` from the root of the project to get all the necessary dependencies.\r\nThe, open the `tasks/typescript/medium` directory.\r\n\r\nOnce you have created the calculator, you can test your solution with this command:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpx ts-node tasks/typescript/medium/calculator.ts\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf your solution works, the tests should return these values:\r\n```bash\r\n8\r\n2\r\n15\r\n1.666...\r\nWarning message & null\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the values look correct, you are ready to make a Pull request!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions and how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

The bookstore contains multiple books, and each book has a title, an author, a published year, and a price.\r\n\r\n### Requirements:\r\n\r\n-   The root element should be `<bookstore>`.\r\n-   Each book in the bookstore should be represented by a `<book>` element.\r\n-   Each `<book>` element should have child elements:\r\n    -   `<title>` : Contains the title of the book.\r\n    -   `<author>` : Contains the author's name.\r\n    -   `<year>` : Contains the published year.\r\n    -   `<price>` : Contains the book's price.\r\n\r\n### Hints:\r\n\r\n-   Ensure your XML is well-formed. This means every start tag has a matching end tag, tags are properly nested, etc.\r\n-   Try to validate your XML using an [XML validator tool](https://www.xmlvalidation.com/) to make sure it's correct.\r\n\r\nAcceptance Criteria:\r\n\r\n-   The XML file should properly represent a bookstore and its collection of books.\r\n-   The XML should be well-formed and pass validation checks.\r\n\r\n## How to get started\r\nOpen the `tasks/xml/easy` directory from the root of your project.\r\nThen open up the `book_store.xml` file and once it is properly created according to the XML syntax, you are done and ready to make a pull request!\r\n*Note: You can test your XML code in a editor like [this](https://www.xmlvalidation.com/)*.\r\n\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions and how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

The actions-user bot will reset the file back to previous state for the next contributor after your commit is merged. So you can just simply start working with the issue right away!*\r\n\r\n*Issue created by [Avtech04](https://github.com/Avtech04).*\r\n\r\n### How to get started:\r\nNavigate to the `tasks/css/medium/fire` directory from the root of the project.\r\nOpen `styles.css` file and start implementing your solution!\r\n\r\n### Description:\r\nYour task is to create a fire animation similar as in the video provided.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/assets/82566656/821a9549-fa43-4772-84a5-5bd85239378b\r\n\r\nIn the directory, there are two files: `index.html` and `styles.css`. The `index.html` file contains all the necessary HTML for the fire animation. In `styles.css` there are some classes already filled for you, and some classes that are missing the styles.\r\nAdd all the necessary styles for these classes:\r\n```css\r\n.fire-right .main-fire {\r\n  /* TODO: Add the necessary styles here */\r\n}\r\n\r\n.fire-right .particle-fire {\r\n  /* TODO: Add the necessary styles here */\r\n}\r\n\r\n.fire-left .main-fire {\r\n  /* TODO: Add the necessary styles here */\r\n}\r\n\r\n.fire-left .particle-fire {\r\n  /* TODO: Add the necessary styles here */\r\n}\r\n```\r\n*Note: You are only required to modify the `styles.css` file.*\r\n\r\n### How to run:\r\nIf you are using VS Code and have for example Live Server extension, you can simply open `index.html` with the server and check how the animation looks. If it looks to be working as expected, you are ready to make a pull request!\r\nIf you do not have Live Server extension, you'll find information about installing and how to use it [here](https://www.donskytech.com/visual-studio-code-live-server/).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions and how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

The actions-user bot will reset the file back to previous state for the next contributor after your commit is merged. So you can just simply start working with the issue right away!*\r\n\r\nNavigate to the `tasks/css/medium/card` directory from the root of the project.\r\n\r\nIn this directory, there are two files: `index.html` and `styles.css`. The `index.html` file contains a `div` with the class `card`. Your task is to implement this class in the `styles.css` file to style the `div` as a `card`.\r\n\r\nHere are the specifications for the card:\r\n\r\n-   Width and height: The card should have a width of 300px and a height of 400px.\r\n-   Background color: The card's background color should be `#f8f9fa`.\r\n-   Border: The card should have a 1px solid border with the color `#dee2e6`.\r\n-   Border Radius: The card should have a border radius of 5px.\r\n-   Shadow: The card should have a box shadow of 0px 2px 5px rgba(0,0,0,0.15).\r\n-   Padding: The card should have a padding of 20px.\r\n\r\nSo, open the `styles.css` file to start implementing the design!\r\n\r\n*Note: You are only required to modify the `styles.css` file.*\r\n\r\nIf you are using VS Code and have for example Live Server extension, you can simply open `index.html` with the server and check how the card looks. After the card is done, you are ready to make a pull request!\r\nIf you do not have Live Server extension, you'll find information about installing and how to use it [here](https://www.donskytech.com/visual-studio-code-live-server/).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions and how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

The actions-user bot will reset the file back to previous state for the next contributor after your commit is merged.

You should see the \"Hello, NGINX!\" on the screen served from the `index.html` file.\r\n\r\nIf everything looks to work as expected, you are ready to make a pull request by committing the `nginx.conf` file.\r\n\r\nRemember to also shut down the server after you are done:\r\n```bash\r\nnginx -s quit\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr, with administrative permissions:\r\n```bash\r\nsudo nginx -s quit\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo work with this issue, you need to have NGINX installed to your local machine.\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions of installing NGINX as well as how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

If the available space falls below a certain threshold, the script should send an email alert to a specified email address.\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\n-   Threshold for low disk space should be configurable (e.g., below 20%).\r\n-   The email should contain detailed information about the disk space status.\r\n-   Use the `df` command for getting disk space information.\r\n-   Use `mail` command to send email.\r\n\r\nNext step is optional but if you would like to make this actually functional for email sending, you could use for example the mail command-line utility for that:\r\n\r\nOn Linux/Ubuntu:\r\n```bash\r\nsudo apt-get install mailutils\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn macOS:\r\n```bash\r\nbrew install mailutils\r\n```\r\n\r\n### To run the script:\r\n\r\nMake sure you are in the correct directory with the command:\r\n```bash\r\ncd tasks/bash/medium\r\n```\r\n\r\nEnsure you have the required permissions to execute the script by running this command:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nchmod +x disk_monitor.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nExecute the script:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./disk_monitor.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo work with this issue, you need to have Bash installed to your local machine.\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions of installing Bash and how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

So you can just simply start working with the issue right away!*\r\n\r\n### How to get started\r\n\r\nStart by opening the `tasks/flask/easy` directory from the root of the project. \r\nThen open `app.py` file and start working on your solution!\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe aim of this task is to set up and run a basic Flask web application.\r\nInside `app.py`, write a simple Flask app that returns \"Hello, Flask!\" when the root URL (\"/\") is accessed.\r\n\r\n### How to run the program\r\n\r\nTo test the program, you can run `python app.py` to start the server, open your browser and head to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.\r\nIf you see \"Hello, Flask!\" in the browser screen, you are ready to make a pull request.\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n-   You can use the Flask extension for VS Code to help with development. You may find it in the VS Code extensions marketplace.\r\n-   Refer to the [official Flask documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/latest/) for more information.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo work with this issue, you need to have Python and Flask installed to your local machine.\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions of installing Python and Flask. You can also find there instructions of how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

The actions-user bot will reset the file back to previous state for the next contributor after your commit is merged. So you can just simply start working with the issue right away!*\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWe have a TypeScript file (`main.ts`) with several functions that are incomplete. The task is to implement these functions to fetch a list of products from an API, display them in a table, and apply filters.\r\n\r\n## How to get started\r\n\r\nFirst, run `npm i` from the root of the project to get all the necessary dependencies.\r\nThen, open the `tasks/typescript/hard` directory.\r\nAfter that you can open the `main.ts` file and start implementing your solution!\r\n*Note: You don't need to modify the `products.html` or `styles.css` files for this task.*\r\n\r\n### Objectives:\r\n\r\n-   Implement the `fetchData()` function to fetch products from the API `https://dummyjson.com/products` and populate the products array.\r\n-   Implement the `displayProducts()` function to display the products in the table (`#productTable`) on the HTML page.\r\n-   Implement the filter function inside `applyFilters()` to filter the products based on user inputs for minimum and maximum price, and rating.\r\n\r\nRefer [DummyJSON Docs](https://dummyjson.com/docs/products) for more documentation about the API.\r\n\r\n### Task Breakdown:\r\n#### fetchData()\r\n\r\n-   Use fetch to retrieve data from `https://dummyjson.com/products`\r\n-   Populate the products array with the data fetched\r\n\r\n#### displayProducts(products: Product[])\r\n\r\n-   Take in an array of products as an argument\r\n-   Populate the table (`#productTable`) in HTML\r\n-   Make sure to clear previous rows in the table before populating new ones\r\n\r\n#### applyFilters()\r\n\r\n-   Retrieve user inputs for minimum and maximum price, and rating\r\n-   Filter the products array based on these inputs\r\n-   Call `displayProducts()` to display the filtered list\r\n\r\n### How to Test:\r\n\r\nFirst you have to compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript with the command `tsc tasks/typescript/hard/main.ts`.\r\nThat will create `main.js` file to the directory which `products.html` will be able to use.\r\n\r\nAfter compiling, if you are using VS Code and have for example Live Server extension, you can simply open `products.html` with the server and check how the page looks.\r\nIf you do not have Live Server extension, you'll find information about installing and how to use it [here](https://www.donskytech.com/visual-studio-code-live-server/).\r\n    \r\n-   Check if the products are displayed correctly in the table.\r\n-   Apply some filters and verify if the table gets updated according to the filters.\r\nIf the page works as requested, you are ready to make a pull request!\r\n\r\n#### Expected Outcome:\r\n![fork-commit-merge-typescript-hard](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/assets/82566656/140536c5-aa62-4fb4-8a3c-20822cd382b1)\r\n\r\n### Tips:\r\n\r\n-   Make sure to cast HTML elements to their specific types when using TypeScript.\r\n-   Test each function independently before integrating them together.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions and how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

It is denoted by n!.\r\n\r\n##### For example:\r\n\r\n-   factorial(0) should return 1\r\n-   factorial(4) should return 24 (because 4!=4×3×2×1=244!=4×3×2×1=24)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo get started, open the `tasks/lisp/easy` directory from the root of the project.\r\nAfter that, open the `factorial.lisp` file to start implementing the solution!\r\n\r\nTo run the program, make sure you are in the right directory with this command:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncd tasks/lisp/easy\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter that, simply type the command `sbcl` and hit Enter to start the SBCL REPL.\r\nThen load the file with the command `(load \"factorial.lisp\")`.\r\nAfter loading, you can call the function `(factorial 4)` which should return 24.\r\nIf the function works like expected,  you are ready to make a pull request!\r\nYou can exit the SBCL REPL by typing `(quit)` and then hitting Enter.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo work with this issue, you need to have Lisp installed to your local machine.\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions of installing Lisp and how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

The actions-user bot will reset the file back to previous state for the next contributor after your commit is merged. So you can just simply start working with the issue right away!*\r\n\r\n#### Description\r\n\r\n-    Build a simple Vue.js application that allows users to add tasks, mark them as done, and filter between all tasks and completed tasks.\r\n\r\nStart by navigating inside of the directory used in this project with the command:\r\n```bash\r\ncd tasks/vue/medium/vue-task-list\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen run `npm i` to install Vue.js and all the necessary dependencies for the project.\r\n\r\nAfter installing the dependencies you can open the `src/components` directory and `TaskList.vue` file, and start implementing your solution!\r\n\r\n#### Requirements\r\n\r\n-   Add a button to trigger the task addition.\r\n-   Loop through tasks and display them.\r\n-   Display the count of total and completed tasks.\r\n-   Add filter buttons.\r\n-   Implement the required data, computed, and methods to handle tasks, filters, and task count.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to use any CSS styling in this project.\r\n\r\n#### Run the Vue app\r\n\r\nTo check how to the Task List looks, make sure you are in the `tasks/vue/medium/vue-task-list` in your terminal and run `npm run serve` to start the Vue server. \r\nThen, open a browser and go to http://localhost:8080/ to see your app.\r\n\r\nIf the Task List looks to be working correctly, you are ready to make a pull request!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo work with this issue, you need to have npm and NodeJS installed to your local machine.\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions of installing npm and NodeJS as well as how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

The actions-user bot will reset the file back to previous state for the next contributor after your commit is merged. So you can just simply start working with the issue right away!*\r\n\r\n### Objective:\r\nYour task is to design a TLA+ specification for a simple counter. The counter should start at 0 and have the ability to increment and decrement, but it should never go below 0.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria:\r\n\r\n-   The counter must start at 0.\r\n-   The counter can be incremented.\r\n-   The counter can be decremented, but never go below 0.\r\n\r\n### How to get started:\r\n\r\nYou can create the counter inside VS Code.\r\nOpen up the `counter.tla` file inside of `tasks/tla+/easy` directory and start implementing your solution!\r\n\r\n### How to test the solution\r\n\r\n-   Open up the TLA+ Toolbox program, that you should have installed.\r\n-   Create a new spec by selecting File > New Spec.\r\n-   Navigate to and select the .tla file you wrote in VS Code.\r\n-   Once the specification is loaded, create a new model by clicking the TLC Model Checker > New Model.\r\nYou can use the default name for the model and just click OK.\r\n-   Click the TLC Model Checker again and open up the TLC Console so you can see the output.\r\n-   Start running the model checking process by clicking TLC Model Checker > Run Model or just simply press F11.\r\nThis will run the check and you will see the output in the console.\r\n\r\nYou should see something like this: \r\n\r\n```bash\r\nStarting...

The actions-user bot will reset the file back to previous state for the next contributor after your commit is merged. So you can just simply start working with the issue right away!*\r\n\r\n#### Description:\r\n\r\nIn this task, you're expected to implement a simple Clojure function that adds two numbers and prints the result in a formatted string.\r\n\r\n#### Requirements:\r\n\r\nImplement a function named add-numbers that:\r\n-   Takes in two arguments, x and y, which will be numbers.\r\n-   Prints the result in the format: \"The sum of x and y is: result\".\r\n\r\n#### Example:\r\n\r\nFor input values of 3 and 5, your function should print:\r\n\r\n```clojure\r\nThe sum of 3 and 5 is: 8\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo get started, open the `tasks/clojure/easy/add-numbers/src/add_numbers` directory from the root of the project.\r\nAfter that, open the `core.clj` file to start implementing the solution!\r\n\r\nTo test the program, you can use REPL with Calva VS Code extension. If you don't have them installed, go check out the Installing Clojure section in [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md).\r\n\r\nTo run the program, use Ctrl+Shift+C and after that Ctrl+Shift+J to open Project Type/Connect Sequence on top of the VS Code. From there, select `fork-commit-merge/tasks/clojure/easy/add-numbers` and press Enter.\r\nAfter that you need to select `Leiningen` and press Enter.\r\nNow the REPL server is running.\r\nOn the right side of the screen you should now see `output.calva.repl` file opened, where under this text `clj꞉add-numbers.core꞉> ` you can add commands.\r\nWrite command `(add-numbers 3 5)` and press Enter.\r\nIf the function works like expected, you should now see `The sum of 3 and 5 is: 8` text, which means you are ready to make a pull request!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo work with this issue, you need to have Clojure and Leiningen installed to your local machine.\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions of installing Clojure and Leiningen and how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

The actions-user bot will reset the file back to previous state for the next contributor after your commit is merged. So you can just simply start working with the issue right away!*\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe goal is to create a text-based adventure game that is entirely navigable through hyperlinks in different Markdown files. Each Markdown file represents a \"room\" or \"event\", and options for players are presented as hyperlinks to other Markdown files.\r\nThere is a folder called `adventure` in `tasks/markdown/hard` directory, in which you can create various of Markdown files representing different stages or events in the game.\r\n\r\n### Steps\r\n\r\nOpen a directory in `tasks/markdown/hard` named `adventure`.\r\nInside this directory, there is a `start.md` file. This is the starting point of your game. Write a brief description of the scenario and provide options to the player (as links pointing to other Markdown files). For instance, you could have options like Go north and Go south which point to `north.md` and `south.md`, respectively.\r\nCreate the Markdown files for all possible paths in the game. Each file should describe the current situation and provide further options to the player. Make sure to include a way to win and a way to lose the game.\r\n\r\n### Expected outcome\r\n\r\nA fully playable text-based adventure game made entirely of linked Markdown files. The game should be complex enough to provide some level of challenge to the player, with a variety of different paths, outcomes, and choices.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of how a file in this game might look:\r\n\r\n```md\r\n# Forest\r\n\r\nYou are in a forest. There's a path to the [north](north.md) and a path to the [south](south.md).\r\nThere's also a suspicious looking [berry bush](berry-bush.md) nearby.\r\n```\r\n\r\nCreating this game might be quite complex, as it requires planning the game's structure, writing engaging text, and managing many interconnected Markdown files. However, it will be a great exercise for you to learn advanced Markdown usage.\r\n*Note: You can test your Markdown code in a editor like [this](https://stackedit.io/)*.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions and how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

The actions-user bot will reset the file back to previous state for the next contributor after your commit is merged. So you can just simply start working with the issue right away!*\r\n\r\nOpen the `tasks/haskell/medium` directory from the root of your project.\r\n\r\nThen open a file called `Fibonacci.hs`.\r\n\r\n### Description:\r\n\r\nThe goal of this task is to create a simple Haskell program that calculates and prints Fibonacci numbers. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.\r\n\r\nYour Haskell program should have the following features:\r\n\r\n-   A function to calculate Fibonacci numbers up to a specified limit.\r\n-   Print the Fibonacci numbers up to the limit.\r\n\r\n### Task Details:\r\n\r\n-   Implement a function fibonacci :: Integer -> [Integer] that calculates Fibonacci numbers up to the specified limit. You can use recursion or an iterative approach.\r\n-   Implement a function main that takes user input for the limit and prints the Fibonacci numbers.\r\n\r\n### Example Output:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nEnter the limit for Fibonacci numbers:\r\n10\r\nFibonacci numbers:\r\n[0,1,1,2,3,5,8]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How to run:\r\n\r\nFirst, make sure you are in the correct directory:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncd tasks/haskell/medium\r\n```\r\n\r\nCompile the program:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nghc -o fibonacci Fibonacci.hs\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter the program is compiled, you can run:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./fibonacci\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the program works as expected,  you are ready to make a pull request!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo work with this issue, you need to have Haskell installed to your local machine.\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions of installing Haskell and how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

Return 0 if they're the same, a negative number if the current string is lexicographically smaller, and a positive number otherwise.\r\n\r\n**Overloaded operators:**\r\n-   Overload the assignment = operator for assignment of one MyString to another.\r\n-   Overload the addition + operator to concatenate two MyString objects.\r\n-   Overload the equality == operator to compare two MyString objects for equality.\r\n-   Overload the stream insertion << operator for easy printing of the MyString object.\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n\r\n-   Use dynamic memory allocation (e.g., new and delete) for string storage.\r\n-   Handle memory leaks and ensure proper memory management.\r\n-   The class should be robust against possible errors, such as null pointers.\r\n \r\n### Bonus\r\n\r\n-   Implement a substring(int start, int end) function that returns a new MyString object containing characters from start to end.\r\n\r\n### Tips\r\n\r\n-   Remember to check for null pointers before any operation.\r\n-   During memory allocation, always check if memory was successfully allocated.\r\n-   For string manipulation, you might find the C++ string functions like strcpy, strcat, etc., from cstring useful.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo test the program you have to first make sure you are in the right directory:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncd tasks/c++/hard\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen compile the files:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ng++ main.cpp mystring.cpp -o mystring_test\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen you can run the compiled program by running:\r\n```bash\r\n./mystring_test\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning the program should output:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nHello World\r\nBoth strings are equal!\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the program works as requested in the task, you are ready to make a pull request!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo work with this issue, you need to have C++ installed to your local machine.\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions of installing C++ and how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

The actions-user bot will reset the file back to previous state for the next contributor after your commit is merged. So you can just simply start working with the issue right away!*\r\n\r\n### How to Get Started:\r\nOpen the `tasks/html/hard` directory from the root of your project.\r\nThen open the `index.html` file.\r\n\r\n### Objective:\r\n\r\nDevelop a simple but complete HTML web page as in the screenshots that includes a navigation bar, several content sections (e.g., About, Services, Contact), and a footer. The page should provide a smooth user experience on desktop. It does not have to be responsive so you don't need to worry about the view on smaller screens.\r\n\r\n![html-hard-screenshot](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/assets/82566656/f343040a-89a9-47ba-b9e8-119cefb3704a)\r\n\r\n![html-hard-screenshot2](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/assets/82566656/c738cb06-4f74-48f4-b024-3e72569f07a8)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Classes and ID:s:\r\n\r\nYou can study `styles.css` to see what classes and id:s possibly to use in your code to make it look same as in the screenshots. You are also welcome to add your own classes if you like.\r\n\r\nYou can use `https://loremflickr.com/320/240` as source for the images. It will create some random images for the project.\r\n\r\nPlease note that at this stage, the form doesn't need to submit data to any server-side script. Purpose of this task is to just create the form visually without any functionality.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you are using VS Code and have for example Live Server extension, you can simply open `index.html` with the server and check how the form looks. After the form is done, you are ready to make a pull request!\r\nIf you do not have Live Server extension, you'll find information about installing and how to use it [here](https://www.donskytech.com/visual-studio-code-live-server/).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/nikohoffren/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions and how to make a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\r\n\r\n#### Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!",

It could be a funciton that accepts an extension-less file path, and does the work of checking if a JSON, CJS, JS, MJS file exists from there and load appropriately?\n\n**Additional context or notes**\nInteresting, the lambda invoker plugin has a similar problem / solution, and even goes so far as to support `.cjs` files (see [the code here](https://github.com/architect/plugin-lambda-invoker/blob/main/src/input-handler.js#L13-L16)).\n\nRelated issues:\n- https://github.com/architect/plugin-lambda-invoker/issues/16\n",

      "description" : "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\n`arc create` bootstraps a basic arc project, with [a `package.json`](https://github.com/architect/create/blob/main/src/bootstrap/_arc-package.js) and [an `app.arc`](https://github.com/architect/create/blob/main/src/bootstrap/_arc-package.js). [Arc provides its own special way of sharing code](https://arc.codes/docs/en/guides/developer-experience/sharing-code) using the special `@architect/shared` and `@architect/views` import paths. Most IDEs and language servers won't understand this out of the box and provide typical authortime affordances like autocomplete without additional configuration making this import path explicit.\n\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nBy adding a `jsconfig.json` file to the root of an arc project, this importing system can be made explicit and tada, authortime shared code autocomplete is gained 'for free.' Here's a `jsconfig.json` file I use that provides this mapping between `@architect/shared` and the `src/shared` folder:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"baseUrl\": \".\",\n    \"checkJs\": true,\n    \"module\": \"NodeNext\",\n    \"moduleResolution\": \"NodeNext\",\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@architect/shared/*\": [\"./shared/*\"]\n    },\n    \"target\": \"ES2021\"\n  },\n  \"exclude\": [\"node_modules\", \"public\"]\n}\n```\n\nOne complicating factor is that the shared code paths [allow for customizing the location of shared code](https://arc.codes/docs/en/guides/developer-experience/sharing-code#custom-shared-paths). Any such customization would need to be taken into account in a solution here.\n\nWhile this file and format originated in VSCode and came out of work put into TypeScript, it does not require TypeScript nor does it introduce a build step. The `compilerOptions` are misleadingly-named as there is no compilation. All it does is provide hints to any language server in use on where to find source code.",

The only difference seems to be that the system has started running out of disk space.\n\nI think the error message could cause some confusion. It would be better if the error message said something like \"could not write file\" or \"not enough disk space available\".\n\n\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\n\nSteps to reproduce the issue\n1. Log in to not-root user on a Fedora CoreOS system (Fedora CoreOS 43.20250518.91.0)\n2. Run command\n   ```\n   podman save --format oci-archive -o /tmp/traefik.oci docker.io/library/traefik\n   ```\n3. Verify that the file `/tmp/traefik.oci` can be imported from another user account \n   with the command \n   ```\n   podman image load -i /tmp/traefik.oci \n   ```\n   (We now know that the file `/tmp/traefik.oci` works fine)\n4.

Since ProbeRunner already stores this reference internally, this integration would be straightforward.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> We should prioritize implementing **initialize** first, as it's the more critical of the two. The finalize callback can be addressed in a follow-up PR.\n\n## Example\n\nHere’s a snippet of code that would be moved into the initialize callback of the `isWeakCrypto` probe:\n\n```js\nthis.tracer = new VariableTracer()\n  .enableDefaultTracing()\n  // ↓↓↓ this part\n  .trace(\"crypto.createHash\", {\n    followConsecutiveAssignment: true, moduleName: \"crypto\"\n  });\n```\n\nWe don't need to trace `crypto.createHash` if the isWeakCrypto probe is not used.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e7dca6f-1881-423b-9fb1-ab8c55736a7a)",

      "description" : "Description\r\n===========\r\n\r\nI'm using `AvroDeserializer` to deserialize records from a topic and I'm running into issues when confluent-kafka-python calls fastavro in the deserialization function:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nobj_dict = schemaless_reader(payload,\r\n    writer_schema,\r\n    self._reader_schema)\r\n```\r\n([link to the source code line](https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-python/blob/6ac115fcc886e609e30d3727868c2d52310e24c1/confluent_kafka/schema_registry/avro.py#L321))\r\n\r\nThe `reader_schema` that I pass in omits a field that is present in the `writer_schema` because I'm not interested in reading it. However, this results in fastavro raising the following exception:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n  File \"fastavro/_read.pyx\", line 835, in fastavro._read.schemaless_reader\r\n  File \"fastavro/_read.pyx\", line 846, in fastavro._read.schemaless_reader\r\n  File \"fastavro/_read.pyx\", line 561, in fastavro._read._read_data\r\n  File \"fastavro/_read.pyx\", line 472, in fastavro._read.read_record\r\n  File \"fastavro/_read.pyx\", line 559, in fastavro._read._read_data\r\n  File \"fastavro/_read.pyx\", line 413, in fastavro._read.read_union\r\n  File \"fastavro/_read.pyx\", line 73, in fastavro._read.match_types\r\n  File \"fastavro/_read.pyx\", line 127, in fastavro._read.match_schemas\r\nfastavro._read_common.SchemaResolutionError: Schema mismatch: {'avro.java.string': 'String', 'type': 'string'} is not null\r\n```\r\n\r\nI suppose this makes sense from fastavro point-of-view because the purpose of the `schemaless_reader` `reader_schema` is for \"schema migration\" ([see here](https://github.com/fastavro/fastavro/blob/7a5220b30c4bbe616a1a42f62fff118cca0928d2/fastavro/_read_py.py#L875)) and a required field cannot just be dropped. From a Kafka topic reader's point of view, it doesn't make sense as a reader might only be interested in a subset of data.\r\n\r\nPersonally, my issue would be solved by allowing `AvroDeserializer` to allow a `None` value for the `reader_schema` and in that case ignoring `reader_schema` completely by calling fastavro like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nobj_dict = schemaless_reader(payload,\r\n    writer_schema,\r\n    None)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr do you feel this should be addressed with fastavro?\r\n\r\nHow to reproduce\r\n================\r\n\r\nChecklist\r\n=========\r\nPlease provide the following information:\r\n\r\n - [x] confluent-kafka-python and librdkafka version (`confluent_kafka.version()` and `confluent_kafka.libversion()`): latest (1.4.2)\r\n - [x] Apache Kafka broker version: Confluent Cloud\r\n - [ ] Client configuration: `{...}`\r\n - [x] Operating system: Ubuntu 18.04 (under WSL1)\r\n - [ ] Provide client logs (with `'debug': '..'` as necessary)\r\n - [ ] Provide broker log excerpts\r\n - [ ] Critical issue\r\n\r\n",

So the CLI is already behaving correctly in this case.\n\nAlso, if we don't provide an --example or --starter, then the CLI does ask for a project name, which also makes sense.\n\nAnd I’ve made a small change and opened a [PR](https://github.com/garden-co/jazz/pull/2596) to ensure that when using an example or starter, the default project name uses the -app suffix consistently. Just a minor improvement ✌️\n\nThanks!" ],

Those should generally try to use the `EntityDisplayName` React component if possible, or use `EntityPresentation.promise` when in non-React code (which becomes available after #24595 is merged).\r\n\r\nWe'd appreciate the help with digging through the Backstage core and plugins, finding places where the presentation API should be used.\r\n\r\n### \uD83D\uDC40 Have you spent some time to check if this feature request has been raised before?\r\n\r\n- [X] I checked and didn't find similar issue\r\n\r\n### \uD83C\uDFE2 Have you read the Code of Conduct?\r\n\r\n- [X] I have read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\r\n\r\n### Are you willing to submit PR?\r\n\r\nNo, but I'm happy to collaborate on a PR with someone else",

Here’s my approach:\r\n\r\n->I’ll create a mockup to display the patron’s avatar, username as a link, and a Follow button. I’ll ensure the design matches the current style of the site, especially following the look of the My Books feed page, and I'll make sure to use existing CSS where possible.\r\n->I’ll update the backend to fetch public patron data (only if their reading log is public).\r\n->On the frontend, I’ll add the patron’s avatar, make the username a clickable link, and include a small \"Follow\" button. It will be  consistent with the existing follow functionality, ensuring patrons can easily follow others.\r\n\r\nAnd then for the testing, \r\n->After implementation, I’ll run tests for responsiveness, cross-browser compatibility, and edge cases like empty avatars or usernames. I’ll also check for smoothness with the follow feature.\r\n\r\nThis feature can help patrons discover more books through people they follow, and really could be the first step toward building social features on Open Library.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any feedback or suggestions! \uD83D\uDE0A", "Hi @SharkyBytes! Thanks for these details.\r\n\r\n> I’ll update the backend to fetch public patron data (only if their reading log is public).\r\n\r\nIt's _possible_ this part is done already! Or, I think we should take the approach of leaving it anonymous (if their reading log is private) and **otherwise** showing the new design. In either case, these two modes / design should hopefully be fairly consistent with each other.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to seeing your designs and we can bring them for feedback to either our Tuesday or Friday community calls!", "Here's one design that standardizes the `Catalog Card` from the search results page with `Events` that might appear on the `Feed` or `Trending Now` page(s)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"766\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-01-01 at 1 07 20 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33281437-2303-46b7-b394-2424c6e478b5\" />\r\n\r\nIt proposes creating an augmented, extended version of the `Catalog Card` called a `Catalog Card Event`.\r\n\r\nThis would replace the current Trending Now card and make things a bit more standardized.\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4308be87-6d53-410a-9d90-51b20fddca6c)\r\n\r\nIt's at least something we can work towards in the meantime (and then discuss designs further).\r\n\r\nI think it will be important to develop things modularly such that the `Event` section can be reused in multiple contexts and that a `Catalog Card Event` component can be composed (as a template) by rendering a top `Event` section and then a `Catalog Card` (i.e. macro/SearchResultWork) below it.", "@SharkyBytes are you still working on this?", "Yeah, @ananyakaligal, I’m working on this.

I'll followup on slack and see if we can work together to find a themed set of high impact issues to tackle together.", "Hi @mekarpeles,\r\n\r\nI’m currently working on this issue and am excited to start my contribution journey. I wanted to share an update with you and seek your advice.\r\n\r\nHere’s what I’ve accomplished so far:\r\n\r\n1. Successfully fetched the patron data.\r\n2. Added the follow button.\r\n3. Updated the underlined username link to redirect to the patron’s profile.\r\n4. Ensured the \"Want to Read\" link navigates correctly to the patron’s \"Want to Read\" section.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you’d like any adjustments to these features!\r\n\r\nThat said, I’m currently facing an issue with implementing the follow functionality (so the follow button works as expected). I’m actively working on resolving this, but if you have any suggestions, resources, or pointers that could save me from searching through the full codebase, it would be a huge help.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your guidance!\r\n\r\nCurrent Implementation :-\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cdcd0ca5-b777-4744-b059-803bcac9e393)\r\n", "@SharkyBytes great work so far:\r\n* Let's try to make the follow button follow the same type of style and classes as the rest of our buttons (e.g. consistent color and border-radius).\r\n* For the follow button, you may wish to consult the **Feed** https://openlibrary.org/people/mekBot/books/feed referenced in the original post, which uses the `Follow` macro: https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/blob/master/openlibrary/macros/Follow.html\r\n\r\n\r\n## What to do if a patron is not logged in?\r\n\r\nThis case is actually almost completely handled for us already by the `Follow` macro.\r\n\r\nIf a visitor navigates to the `/trending/now` page, the `Follow` macro will **already** show a real `Follow` button if they're logged in:\r\nhttps://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/pull/8607/files#diff-f8a08ee2ccd19673120d20e7bb9a9bb0522f49eed20aa98edd0007787058c302R7\r\n\r\nAnd if they're not logged in, an `else` condition will ensure the visitor get a `Follow` button that routes the visitor to login: \r\nhttps://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/pull/8607/files#diff-f8a08ee2ccd19673120d20e7bb9a9bb0522f49eed20aa98edd0007787058c302R16-R17\r\n\r\nThe `Follow` macro is built so that in this login case, a special request variable `ctx.path` (i.e. the current url of the page we're rendering) is computed, so that whatever page calls it can be  preserved by passing it along to the login endpoint request as a URL parameter called `?redir_url`, so after the patron logs in, they can be redirected back to the page they came from. In this case, `ctx.path` would know we're on the `/trending` page and so the login redirect will happen for us automatically.\r\n\r\n## Opportunity\r\n\r\nOne caveat of this flow is, by logging in, we're not actually completing the `Follow` the patron requested! They have to click `Follow`, login, go back to `/trending` and figure out that they have to click `Follow` again, which is both non-intuitive and may be difficult as the `/trending` page changes from moment to moment and so the person they were trying to follow may not be on the page anymore! \uD83E\uDD26 \r\n\r\nI'm considering this a **separate**, followup issue tracked here (which has a volunteer: @ShilpThapak):\r\n* #10338\r\n", "Hey @mekarpeles,\n\nI'm encountering an issue with the local instance of Open Library. I’ve set all reading activity to private, as shown in the image below. However, when I add books to the \"Want to Read\" section from my personal account, the system still displays my name and the section I added the book to. While the \"Want to Read\" link itself is protected (I can't view the detailed logs), it still reveals who added the book and where.\n\nAs we discussed earlier, the expected behavior should be to display something like \"Someone added to Want to Read\" instead of showing the user's name and activity details. Am I right?\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe39d381-a8dd-40c2-9348-c27a164d98b2)\n\nI’ve also tried debugging the entry, but I’m unsure which field determines whether the reading logs are private. In the entry, I noticed that both openlibrary and personal show None for the private field, which seems to indicate no restrictions. Could you clarify which field controls this behavior and if there's a potential issue with the logic handling privacy settings?\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/046cebfd-d268-40fd-bf14-584a9c471342)", "Also, @mekarpeles, I noticed another issue regarding avatars. As shown in the image below, the avatar isn’t displaying because the ` /people/test_username/avatar` redirects to the main archive site and shows \"Item not available.\"\n\nI had a detailed discussion about this with @scottbarnes, who was incredibly helpful. However, we’re now uncertain whether we should display a default avatar when no profile picture is available or if we should simply leave the avatar blank.\n\nWould love your thoughts on this!", "You'll need to fetch the patrons privacy value from their account setting object (you should be able to perform a get_many on all the patrons in one page) and conditionally load their name / follow buttons, etc. there may also be a private book on the reading log entry\n\nWe should use a default avatar if private \n\nWe can do the following to get a mapping of patrons to their privacy:\n```\nusernames = ['mekBot', 'ScarTissue', 'seabelis', 'brewster', 'jachamp']\nuser_prefs = web.ctx.site.get_many([f'/people/{username}/preferences' for username in usernames])\nfollowable = dict((user.key.split('/')[2], user.notifications.public_readlog == 'yes') for user in user_prefs)\n```", "@SharkyBytes are you still working on this?\n\nIf not, @mekarpeles Can I work on this?", "Hi, I'd love to work on this issue!", "@SharkyBytes, it seems like you've done a bit of work on this issue. Do you still plan to work on it? Otherwise, do you think you can push up the code you've worked on so far so others can help take the feature over the finish line and your commits still get included in the final result?", "@ragipidavid would you like to try this one? :) " ],

It seems to probably happen only in Chrome, unless perhaps it is just harder to reproduce in Firefox (I wasn't able to reproduce it in FF in my testing right now, but haven't ruled it out). See `NumberInput.svelte`.\n\nWhen you click and drag a number input field of the increment (not range) style, meaning the kind you can drag infinitely left or right, it will sometimes teleport the value to a wildly different value from the one it started with. This can be reproduced by drawing a rectangle and dragging left and right on its stroke weight parameter in the Properties panel repeatedly in quick, small left and right drags until occasionally it will make a big jump.\n\nI hypothesize this is caused by weirdness in the event ordering and mouse position reporting with the [pointer lock](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_Lock_API) API, and it might be related to the widget being broken in Safari: #2038. I recommend logging the values that are being reported by the API and current state every frame to narrow down when the events occur and produce the discrepancy.\n\nAt the the 4-second mark in this video, we see it jump from `131.3` to `17.3` immediately when the click-and-drag begins:\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61b1b1e6-4560-4555-aac5-f7b54cbfacb9",

This cluster has quite stringent security requirements enforced by gatekeeper that denies certain configuration on certain resources.\n\nOne of them is requiring that all ServiceAccount objects have explicitly set:\n```automountServiceAccountToken: false```\n\nThe deployment is still allowed to explicitly set auto mounting of the service account to true:\n```\nspec:\n  automountServiceAccountToken: true\n```\n\nAs far as I can tell this has the exact same functionality from the Pod's perspective.\n\nWould it be feasible to do this on all service accounts in nginx-gateway-fabric? More specifically:\n1. In the Helm chart template or allow it to be controlled through helm values\n2. In the ServiceAccount of the data plane that is dynamically created by the control plane based on the Gateway spec\n\nI can work around the first one by inlining the chart and changing the template but it's annoying when having to upgrade to newer chart versions so ideally it would be controllable by chart values or just be the default.\n\nThe second thing is more problematic since I don't seem to have a way to define this on the dynamically created data plan ServiceAccount and Deployment. I can only change annotations and labels through the Gateway infrastructure yaml section.\n\nThanks for you feedback.</div>\n\n====\n\n**As a user** of NGF in an environment that restricts usage of the automountServiceAccountToken field\n**I want** to configure that field in my Helm chart for NGF\n**So that** I can use NGF in the restricted environment.\n\n### Acceptance\n- The NGF Helm chart is updated to make both of the following fields configurable:\n  - The \"automountServiceAccountToken\" for all ServiceAccount objects\n  - The \"automountServiceAccountToken\" for all Deployment objects",

IIUC FS-HLE should write the values set by the game to the FS system save data, and then later return it. I don't think there's more to it, since the actual value checks are probably handled by the game itself?\n\nFor future compatibility with FS-LLE, it would be interesting to know what exactly the FS system save data for this looks like. Does FS create one file per game in its system save data, or does it use an internal format instead? Perhaps @ZeroSkill1 knows more?", "@neobrain I noticed some weird implementations on the FS side for secure values a while back, but I got busy so I left it unexplored until just now.\n\n- 0x865/0x866 require special permissions to use (or if the caller doesn't have them, at least the save ID set in the exheader) and read/write secure values only from the FS system save.\n- 0x86B/0x86C also require special permissions (save ID in the exheader does not suffice here) and read/write secure values directly to/from the save data DISA header and not the FS system save (the DISA header containing secure values [or hell, even gamecards being able to use secure values] is something that was previously *completely* unknown to my knowledge). (though you can force these two commands to read/write to/from the system save by setting the media type to 100, very strange)\n\n- 0x86E/0x86F read and write secure values:\n    - to/from the FS module system save data for media types SD & NAND\n    - to/from the DISA header for gamecards\n- 0x870/0x871 are identical to 0x86E/0x86F, except that instead of taking a media type and title ID, those are resolved through internal state using the given archive handle (which of course only works if the handle corresponds to a DISA).\n\nI've added the storage format for values in the DISA header to 3dbrew already.\nAs for the structure of the FS system save for secure values, this is the structure (which I will also add to 3dbrew soon):\n\n```c\ntypedef union secval_key {\n    u64 title_id;\n    struct {\n        u32 slot;\n        u32 unique_id;\n    } key_with_slot;\n} secval_key;\n\ntypedef struct secure_save {\n    u8 version;\n    u8 pads[3];\n    u32 count;\n    u32 unused[1022];\n    secval_key keys[0x3800];\n    u64 secure_values[0x3800];\n} secure_save;\n```\n\nSystem savedata ID 0x10011 is used (one of two FS module system saves, the other being SEEDDB), in which a file named just `DB` is created, consisting entirely of just the `secure_save` struct.\n" ],

It would be helpful if you can guide and share some reference about this issue.\n\nHi @00thirdeye00 - `getc(FILE *stream)` shouldn't be too difficult.\n\nFrom a very high level, it should be as simple as \n1. lock the fdtable entry associated with `stream` (and verify that it is valid)\n2. read a character and report it back, or `EOF` if there is an error.\n3. unlock the fdtable entry\n\nDo we still have `zvfs_read()` or was that reverted?

I think the desired documentation is different than [the docs page on how to publish to the App Store](https://briefcase.readthedocs.io/en/stable/how-to/publishing/iOS.html), since the goal is just to run on a device tied to the developer's Apple account.

The problem with the recreation is either:\r\n\r\n- if the auth key is already expired, creation of the machine fails or\r\n- the machine gets a different name by adding a suffix like \"-1\" for example.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I would like tsdproxy to prevent the creation of machines that already exist. Is that possible? Another solution could be the use of never expiring OAuth ephemeral nodes?!\r\n\r\nThx a lot for the great software! :blush: \r\n",

We want to start adopting this in more places in our codebase with the eventual goal of making the linter-opt out once the majority of struct initializations are exhaustive.\n\nIf you open a PR to add this annotation to a struct, be sure to reference this issue in the commit comment.",

      "description" : "You should consider adding a `-v` switch that will output the program's version and GitHub URL.  Right now, there is no easy way to tell which version of `up` I am running or where I might download a new version.  While `up` is a great program name, it does make it a bit hard to perform a web search for since it is such a generic word.  Sometimes `-v` is used for `verbose`, but since you already have a `-dbg` option, I think it would be OK to use `-v` for version information.\r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ up -v\r\nup v1.2.1\r\nhttps://github.com/jesusprubio/up\r\n```\r\n",

I think this is related to javy pinning to a stable rust version, and the stable version having moved.\n\nIn summary, you should be able to reproduce the issue just following our instructions to **install** javy:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/nanvix/javy\ncargo build -p javy-plugin --target=wasm32-wasip1 -r\n\n# This is the failing command\ncargo install --path crates/cli\n```\n\nThe error has something to do with the reference-values feature not being enabled, which [it is not](https://github.com/nanvix/javy/blob/dev/.cargo/config.toml). This is a similar issue to [this one](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/128475) which seems to be caused by LLVM 19 making `reference-types` a default feature (see thread [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/128511)).\n\nThis issue is [fixed](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/javy/pull/896) in upstream javy, and I have checked it works by branching nanvix/javy, rebasing to `v5.0.4` and running the tests locally.\n\nWe basically just need to rebase `nanvic/javy` to `v5.0.4`, but I wanted to open this issue first. (Also opening a PR for a rebase would not work very well neither).\n\ncc @ppenna @danbugs ",

Initially, verify the email address, which should proceed smoothly. \r\n- Next, attempt to verify the phone number, Despite the successful verification of the email address, the system incorrectly indicates that the user is unverified when verifying the phone number. \r\n- In an attempt to rectify this inconsistency, proceed to unverify the phone number. Unexpectedly, the system now displays an alert indicating that the user is verified, contradicting the initial indication of being unverified.\n\n### \uD83D\uDC4D Expected behavior\n\n- When the user hits **Verify Phone**, the alert should confirm that the `user is verified`.\r\n- When the user hits **Unverify Phone**, the alert should confirm that the `user is unverified`.\n\n### \uD83D\uDC4E Actual Behavior\n\nWhen attempting to **verify the phone numbe**r, an alert incorrectly states that the `user is unverified`. \r\nHowever, when attempting to **unverify the phone**, the system incorrectly indicates that the `user is verified.`\n\n### \uD83C\uDFB2 Appwrite version\n\nVersion 1.4.x\n\n### \uD83D\uDCBB Operating system\n\nWindows\n\n### \uD83E\uDDF1 Your Environment\n\n_No response_\n\n### \uD83D\uDC40 Have you spent some time to check if this issue has been raised before?\n\n- [X] I checked and didn't find similar issue\n\n### \uD83C\uDFE2 Have you read the Code of Conduct?\n\n- [X] I have read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/appwrite/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)",

It has so much text that it\n\t\t\tdoesn't fit on one line. Wow! So much text!\n\t\t</>\n\t);\n}\n```\n\nIs currently fixed to the following invalid syntax:\n```javascript\nexport function Example() {\n\treturn (\n\t\t\"This is a fragment with lots of text in it. It has so much text that it\n\t\t\tdoesn't fit on one line. Wow! So much text!\"\n\t);\n}\n```\n\nIn my opinion, a multi-line fragment like this is _not_ useless and this rule should not even apply in this case. If the rule does apply it should probably collapse the whitespace here.\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow Biome's Code of Conduct",

This is particularly helpful when it comes to port existing FastAPI applications to MCP.

Currently the runtime will attempt to construct the model component using the provided `params` and only if an error occurs do we propagate it to the user. This is both:\n 1. An expensive feedback cycle (e.g. an error occurs after downloading model weights).\n 2. An vector for poor DX back to the user when parameters are incorrect, invalid or missing.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nSee how data components handle params by being explicit. E.g. [DuckDB](https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai/blob/9d07bce21d9d3ca1904d7ff7afa89cbbcda5b69c/crates/runtime/src/dataconnector/flightsql.rs#L68-L72). Helper struct/utilities [here](https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai/blob/trunk/crates/runtime/src/parameters.rs). \n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nThe current implementation is a feasible working alternative. Improving error message handling in the current paradigm is possible, but requires handling many issues from underlying causes instead of validating parameters explicitly first.\n",

This is because of these lines of code:\n\nhttps://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-unreal/blob/1e9f442cf34762fdae47753cced15ec2791c5665/Source/CesiumRuntime/Private/CesiumPrimitiveFeatures.cpp#L45-L51\n\nIt should also be checking for an `UCesiumGltfInstancedComponent`, and returning the attached features if found.\n\n### Environment\n\nCesium for Unreal version: v2.16.1\nUnreal Engine Version: 5.4\nOperating System: Windows\n\n\n### Reproduction steps\n\n1. Open the sample level `06_CesiumMetadata`.\n2. Load the [Instanced Orientation](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/tree/main/Apps/SampleData/Cesium3DTiles/Instanced/InstancedOrientation) tileset from URL.\n3. In the Level Blueprint, recreate this Blueprint:![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f06de157-a292-43fd-8b6b-67074794b6ab)\n4. Run the level. Click on any of the cubes. You should see a -1 printed no matter what cube you press. However, the metadata table will be populated with the Height property.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5deb5047-d9fa-4887-9433-993cd9676850)",

      "repositoryName" : "ONEARMY/community-platform",
      "description" : "> Do you have attention to detail and would like to work on making the UI nicer? This issue is then for you! :))\n\n## Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.\n1. Comment section is still not matching the designs. The whitespace is lacking between the nested comments and the visually it looks tight, packed and overwhelming.\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6340e9d-7671-4308-acd0-10bf42bffd4b)\n\n2. Additionally the comment on mobile has spacing from the left, leaving the space not being utilised and making the text unnecessarily squeezed.\n<img width=\"361\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28e206b7-fbe6-471c-a2c4-8f09b1284eeb\" />\n\nEspecially with nested comments it becomes obvious:\n<img width=\"361\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86610c32-e365-414c-868e-02621ca54564\" />\n\n3. If the comment has some enters for new line and the the Show more button shows, it creates an awkward space. There is also gap applied.\n<img width=\"918\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a76486ea-e490-4860-940e-c49498ebeb1e\" />\n\n## Describe the solution you'd like\n\nGenerally I think this will need not only adjusting the numbers, but some minor restructuring of the divs. So, let me try to number the improvements:\n\n---\n\n1. Improving the spacings between the nested comments. In the designs there are also the useful buttons in each comment, that are not yet implemented. In the design however, the spacing occurs naturally because of the useful buttons, so I did not need to add a big margin-bottom. I will leave the solution here up to you, but account for the fact that one day in the future we will introduce the useful button for the comment.\n<img width=\"670\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00f1a492-0cfe-4a26-a6d4-a25e9f1e81d2\" />\n\nDon't be afraid to be generous with the spacings, in the devtools i tried 50px as in my designs\n<img width=\"978\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f23db889-05ba-4607-bedc-25d4a4abc321\" />\n\n---\n\n2. Mobile improvement. Here I upload a gif of the solution that I utilised in the Figma designs - it was to hide the left column with the avatar, allowing the text to stretch and then showing the avatar next to the username in 30x30px size.\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/329f7267-8bdb-4d18-a47c-73b7e44d5478)\n\nDon't forget to make sure that the author's badge is working \n<img width=\"502\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b3012c1-567c-4e5e-b781-5f81852bbe28\" />\n\n\n---\n\n3. Putting the Show More button directly under the comment, trimming the whitespaces. \n<img width=\"947\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c07017f7-60f7-4c1c-92f4-859c1267736f\" />\n\n\n---\n\n4. Decreasing the gap here to 5px from 10px\n<img width=\"404\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a1c56f9-11f3-4bd0-9e52-239948b15c2f\" />\n\n\n\n---\n\n5. As you can see, on mobile it gets quite tight. I would suggest removing the word Published from the \"Published x time ago\" information for the comments.\n<img width=\"322\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe06174a-b402-452b-a18b-eefd38b03192\" />\n\n\n---\n\n6. OPTIONAL - In case you would want to act on the point 5. above even more, I would suggest for mobile screens shortening the formulation even more, saying for example 1h ago, 3mo ago or 2yr ago. Reddit does it this way as well.\n\n<img width=\"182\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c194f4c-a4ee-42a1-9c59-dcd5c6b77e42\" />\n\n---\n\n7. OPTIONAL - In case you would still be up for a challenge, having these 2 aligned on the baseline would be a nice achievement, however I didn't manage to get the desired result, since as you can see below, the align-items:baseline does not align them.\n<img width=\"742\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27968c77-de84-400a-8d3f-22e88b37b627\" />\n\n\n\n##  Additional context - [FIGMA FILE HERE](https://www.figma.com/design/XYV3fr8UVOdkNyBmKHHR7f/CP---Comments-Useful---Mobile?node-id=48-79)\nYou can find the figma file above. You can see the components, the desktop and the mobile versions. These design include the correct answer feature or the useful buttons, which are not yet implemented, so feel free to ignore those.\n\n<img width=\"761\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/119c7345-44cf-4baa-9ef6-feed6a05d7ad\" />\n\nIf you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask. :))",

      "description" : "There is an opportunity to DRY by refactoring part of the `APIGateway`, `APIGatewayV2`, and `APIGateway+WebSocket` payload.\n\nAs per my assistant: \n\n--- \n### 1. HTTP Headers and Body Handling\n- Properties like `headers`, `multiValueHeaders` (or just `headers` in V2), and `body`, as well as `isBase64Encoded`, appear in all major APIGateway request/response structs:\n  - `APIGatewayRequest`\n  - `APIGatewayV2Request`\n  - `APIGatewayWebSocketRequest`\n  - Their corresponding response types.\n\n### 2. Context/Identity Structures\n- Each request type defines a nested `Context` struct (sometimes with further nesting like `Identity` or `HTTP`), which contains information about the caller, API, stage, request IDs, etc.\n- Many fields in these context structs overlap, such as `apiId`, `stage`, `requestId`, `domainName`, and `sourceIp`.\n\n### 3. Codable/Sendable Conformance\n- All these types conform to `Codable` (and, where supported, `Sendable`).\n\n### 4. CodingKeys Mapping\n- Several structs use custom `CodingKeys` enums to map from JSON input to struct properties, especially for context/requestContext fields.\n\n### 5. Response Struct Pattern\n- The response structs (`APIGatewayResponse`, `APIGatewayV2Response`, and by alias, `APIGatewayWebSocketResponse`) all follow a similar pattern: `statusCode`, `headers`, `body`, and `isBase64Encoded`, with slight variations.\n\n---\n\n### Candidates for Code Sharing/Abstraction\n- **Protocols:** Define a protocol for common properties (headers, body, isBase64Encoded) and have each struct conform to it.\n  ```swift\n  protocol APIGatewayRequestCommon: Codable {\n      var headers: HTTPHeaders? { get }\n      var body: String? { get }\n      var isBase64Encoded: Bool? { get }\n  }\n  ```\n- **Shared Context/Identity Structs:** Refactor common context/identity fields into base structs or protocols, and compose them in each specific context struct as needed.\n- **Initializers/Decoding Helpers:** Shared extensions or helper initializers to reduce repeated decoding logic for commonly structured properties.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table of Common Properties:**\n\n| Property         | APIGatewayRequest | APIGatewayV2Request | APIGatewayWebSocketRequest |\n|------------------|------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|\n| headers          | ✓                | ✓                   | ✓                          |\n| multiValueHeaders| ✓                | (V2 drops this)     | ✓                          |\n| body             | ✓                | ✓                   | ✓                          |\n| isBase64Encoded  | ✓                | ✓                   | ✓                          |\n| context/requestContext| ✓           | ✓                   | ✓ (as `context`)           |\n| stage            | ✓ (in context)   | ✓ (in context)      | ✓ (in context)             |\n| apiId            | ✓ (in context)   | ✓ (in context)      | ✓ (in context)             |\n| requestId        | ✓ (in context)   | ✓ (in context)      | ✓ (in context)             |\n| domainName       | ✓ (in context)   | ✓ (in context)      | ✓ (in context)             |\n| sourceIp         | ✓ (in context)   | ✓ (in context)      | ✓ (in context.identity)    |\n\n",

(I'm defining this as a city with a population greater than 1,000,000 as that fits the cities shown in episode 7)\n  - [x] Same length of station's name (relies on #24)\n  - [ ] What is the other 1? (beach with palm tree icon)\n- [ ] Measuring\n  - [x] Distance to commercial airport\n  - [x] Distance to Shinkansen (high-speed)\n  - [x] Distance to coastline \n  - [ ] Distance to body of water\n  - [ ] Distance off sea level\n  - [x] Distance to rail station\n  - [x] Distance to McDonalds\n  - [x] Distance to 7/11\n  - [x] Distance to major city (same classification as above)\n  - [ ] What are the other 3? (beach with palm tree icon, tree icon, ladder icon)\n- [x] Tentacles\n  - [x] Zoo (15 mile)\n  - [x] Aquarium (15 mile)\n  - [x] Amusement Park (15 mile)\n  - [x] Museum (1 mile)\n  - [x] Hospital (1 mile)\n  - [x] Movie theater (1 mile)\n  - [x] Library (1 mile)\n  - [ ] Metro line (15 mile)\n\nHopefully, we can add support for every question (in the show)!\n\nEdit: Thanks to [teamshortcut](https://www.reddit.com/user/teamshortcut/) for assistance with questions!",

If one wants to delete more than one table from the library, one can select multiple tables by pressing STRG while clicking. All selected tables are highlighted in light blue color. On right clicking one of the selected tables the highlighting changes to a light gray and the right-clicked table get sourrounded by a blue sqare. In the context menue one can select to delete the table. Only the blue surrounded table gets deleted, not all previously selected tables as exprected.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**\r\n\r\n1. Copy multiple tables to work library (proc copy in=sashelp out=work; select cars class; run)\r\n2. Go to \"LIBRARIES\" pane and select the work library\r\n3. Hold STRG and left-click both just copied tables\r\n4. Righ-click the just selected tables and select Delete from the context menue\r\n5. Only one table is deleted instead of all selected tables\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nAll selected tables are deleted at the same time.

I don't think this is documented anywhere. Here are the main steps:\n\n1\\. First compile the dependency module with `mymodule.swift -emit-library -o /path/to/mymodule.dylib -emit-module-path /path/to/swiftmoduledir/`.  \n2. Compile the executable with `swiftc mymainmodule.swift -emit-object -o /path/to/mymainmodule.o -I /path/to/swiftmoduledir/`  \n3. Link with `swiftc /path/to/mymainmodule.o /path/to/mymodule.dylib -emit-executable -o /path/to/myexe`  \n4. Run the executable normally, or optionally with the new runtime `env DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/libswiftCore.dylib /path/to/myexe`.\n\nOn Linux, the file suffixes would be different (do we support dynamic linking on Linux?), and I imagine replacing DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH with LD_LIBRARY_PATH should just work.\n\nYou can also import a module directory (i.e. containing a `module.modulemap`) with `-I`, or directly import a header `-import-objc-header`.\n\nWe should probably document some examples of invoking swiftc in the help page (right now, it has no examples ❗), and this could be the final example (and the most complicated one). the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH bit is for development, so it's not super clear where we should write that down, but it's not necessarily obvious to a contributor that the locally built compiler compiler links in the OS runtime by default and not the locally built one.\n\nOne potential idea is to have simple example in `--help`, which would a subset of a new document under the `docs/` directory. We can link the document from the `--help` page, so someone can follow it in case they want more complicated examples. The DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH \"trick\" can go into the doc without going into the `--help` information. If we create this new doc, we should also link it from `docs/DebuggingTheCompiler.md`.\n\n\n   ",

I guess in theory if we're really careful about the lookup logic (and the KVStore is async) we could do the loading in parallel (though its still a few more requests) but we'd still have to wait on compaction (without a background-compaction task running, which would require a generic `spawn` method...). Seems much easier to just check the length and skip some code for the common case :)", "If I understand it correctly, this is special casing for channels at the beginning of their life and when they grow, the node will switch over to persisting updates and compaction anyway?\n\nTo me it isn't quite clear if this is really worth it. If the hit is significant, it is also a problem when the channel has outgrown the 'small' stage anyway?", "> If I understand it correctly, this is special casing for channels at the beginning of their life and when they grow, the node will switch over to persisting updates and compaction anyway?\n\nYes.\n\n> To me it isn't quite clear if this is really worth it. If the hit is significant, it is also a problem when the channel has outgrown the 'small' stage anyway?\n\nIts more a recognition of two very different cases - if you're running an \"edge node\" that is just a wallet making occasional payments, then you're likely to never hit the \"large\" stage, and thus avoiding the compaction overhead is a really nice optimization. If you're a larger node that is forwarding/processing many payments, you're very likely to hit the \"large\" stage and the compaction penalty is worth it to avoid the writes.", "At what size would the \"large\" stage be entered then typically and how many htlcs/channel updates is that? A channel monitor of a few kb, that doesn't sound like all that many updates?", "Yea, dunno, we'd have to figure that out. I imagine most mobile nodes probably make in the 100s to low 1000s of payments in their entire lifetime, probably fewer on a single channel once you consider splicing and the like. 10KiB or whatever should be plenty for 100 or 250 payments.", "> Its more a recognition of two very different cases\n\nIt sounds like if you wanted to make this automatic, the metric you'd really want to evaluate to switch this behavior isn't so much monitor size, as one of these:\n\n  - Frequency of updates to the channel\n  - Latency of updates to the channel (more difficult)\n\nThe monitor size is a decent reflection of the _number_ of updates to the channel[1], but with no perception of time it's impossible to evaluate whether it's being stored by a tenured edge node, or a routing node. I think if you took time into account, perhaps by using the block delta between the funding tx and chain tip to estimate update frequency, you could make a more informed assessment.\n\nHowever, I worry that automating the behavior selection is not really following the \"principle of least astonishment.\" \n\nI would think that routing nodes rarely move to the edge, and edge nodes rarely become routing nodes (more often, a routing node starts small and may appear like an edge). And furthermore, I know what my node is likely to be; especially if I'm a Lightning developer and managing this on behalf of users, such as in a mobile wallet.\n\nFor that matter, varying the behavior _per channel_ seems to make node persistence more difficult to reason about. Different channels could persist different ways on my node, depending on a size threshold. Which means they can change without me doing anything. I would think that if the reason for variation is the use case, then one behavior is correct for all channels stored by the node.\n\nIn that light, I'd just leave this a configurable behavior, which I think it is now.\n\n[1] I recognize that size is being used here to evaluate the storage write size, not the number of updates. But I think that is why the discussion is unclear. Compared to update count/frequency, it's much harder to know the storage configuration of a given node, and what the throughput/latency tradeoff is like.", "I think the intent of the proposed change is to optimize for the edge-node case with remote storage. Even an edge node may make enough payments to get a monitor up to 10s of KiB in size, at which point network-level effects like TCP slowstart may dominate the actual network latency. For a \"power-user\" edge node, we really want to use the `MonitorUpdatingPersister`, but paying the extra RTT cost of cleanup on load for every edge node is not a great tradeoff either.\n\nFor a routing node, it still seems to me like a size-based threshold may be something they want, purely as it (very marginally) reduces IO throughput for under-utilized or new channels. Writing out updates (padded to 4KiB or more depending on the storage medium) and then consolidating when the whole monitor is only a few KiB isn't really the right tradeoff no matter what. Of course a routing node is expected to surpass the threshold very quickly, so it shouldn't really make a substantial difference, but it seems strictly better to write out full updates in this case than not.\n\nIndeed, this does lead to a bit of behavior shift, but I think the important metrics wouldn't change - first of all, if you happened to look at storage right after compaction, the stored contents would be identical to a full monitor persistence so I wouldn't really say that this materially changes the way that logic would interact with the stored data (you already have to handle the case of having no in-flight updates!). It also shouldn't materially change the IO throughput or write count for any node, just a fairly marginal strict reduction for routing nodes with fresh channels.", "> At what size would the \"large\" stage be entered then typically and how many htlcs/channel updates is that? A channel monitor of a few kb, that doesn't sound like all that many updates?\n\nFor our probing node running ldk-node with network storage (EFS), at around 20,000 updates over the single channel the average probe duration starts to increase substantially. p75 starts to creep up after about 3,000.", "Do y'all have any further thoughts here, @domZippilli or @amackillop?", "> Do y'all have any further thoughts here, [@domZippilli](https://github.com/domZippilli) or [@amackillop](https://github.com/amackillop)?\n\nI see in the PR it's configurable. I think as long as that's the case, developers who don't want the variation in behavior can set the minimum size to `0`." ],

Currently, comments don’t notify anyone. The expected behavior is:\r\n\r\n- Users can tag others using @username in comments. The system should validate usernames and notify them via email. The email will include the comment, author, and a link to the trace/observation/prompt/session. \r\n    - The email should be sent upon submitting a comment. \r\n    - See [`sendBatchExportSuccessEmail`](https://langfuse.com/changelog/2024-08-20-comments) for an example on how to send emails in our platform  \r\n    - See user data model in [prisma schema](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/blob/065992862d232b27dd1735c291fa48da866b0b72/prisma/schema.prisma) ",

I’m interested in working on the feature for mentioning others in comments.\r\n\r\nProposed Plan:\r\nTagging System: Implement the ability for users to tag team members using @username in comments.\r\nNotification System: Validate usernames and trigger email notifications, including the comment, author, and relevant link.\r\nEmail Functionality: Use sendBatchExportSuccessEmail as a reference for sending emails in the platform.", "Hi @faresbouzayen, the plan sounds good, would you like to work on this? If yes, is there any more guidance you need? ", "Hi @marliessophie, here’s what I’m thinking in terms of next steps:\r\n\r\n**Tagging System Implementation**\r\n**Parsing Logic:**\r\n\r\nUse regex to identify patterns like @username in the comment text.\r\nExtract the username for further validation.\r\n**Username Validation:**\r\n\r\nQuery the user data model in the Prisma schema to check if the extracted username exists.\r\nHandle cases where the username is invalid or not found.\r\n**Notification System**\r\n**Triggering Notifications:**\r\n\r\nOnce a valid mention is detected, store the relevant details (comment text, author, and link).\r\nCreate a queue or use an event-driven approach to process notifications asynchronously.\r\n**Email Content:**\r\n\r\nFormat the email body to include:\r\nThe original comment text.\r\nThe author’s name.\r\nA link to the trace/observation/prompt/session.\r\n**Email Functionality**\r\nUsing Existing Email Functionality:\r\n\r\nReview sendBatchExportSuccessEmail for structure and parameters.\r\nCreate a new function, e.g., sendCommentNotificationEmail, adapting it to our needs.\r\n**Email Sending Logic:**\r\n\r\nEnsure proper error handling if the email fails to send.", "Hey @faresbouzayen your general direction sounds good!\r\nSome notes: \r\n- I don't think we need to reinvent the wheel with this feature, I'd first check to see if you can find a a secure, well rated and maintained open source library before jumping to custom implementation (ie applying a regex to recognise the '@' pattern). Possibly these libraries also come with a dynamic dropdown upon typing '@' that will suggest user names in the given person's project. \r\n- How exactly would you suggest handling invalid usernames? Ideally I'd validate before submitting and then show a form error to the user, such that they don't submit invalid username tags. Suggesting usernames will vastly help here, as mentioned above \r\n- Also, how would you like to store the details exactly before sending? Feel free to have a browse of our code first, that should help \r\n- Regarding sending the emails, content sounds great, and in terms of technical infrastructure you should be able to reuse what we already have, ie don't have to build email processing from scratch. Let me know if you have specific questions here! \r\n\r\nThanks, really excited for your contribution on this!!

The `message` should be informative and should try not to confuse a user into making a wrong \"correction\".\n\n## Resources\n\n- [harwardcommunications](https://blog.harwardcommunications.com/2011/02/21/the-difference-between-damage-and-damages/)\n- [English StackExchange](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/29203/damage-vs-damages)\n- [Grammarphobia](https://www.grammarphobia.com/blog/2020/06/damage-damages.html)\n- [WordReference](https://forum.wordreference.com/threads/damage-or-damages.2588100/)\n- [Cambridge Dictionary \"damages\"](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/damages)\n- [Oxford Learners \"damage\" and \"damages\"](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/damage_1)\n- [Collins Dictionary \"damage\"](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/english-language-learning/damage)\n- [Collins Dictionary \"damages\"](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/english-language-learning/damages)\n- [Merriam-Webster Dictionary \"damage\" and \"damages\"](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/damage)\n\n## Examples\n\nExamples of the error from GitHub:\n- Flow networks robust against **damages** are simple model networks described in a series of publications by Kaluza et al.\n- POC to select vehicle **damages** on a car and mark the severity - sudheeshcm/vehicle-damage-selector.\n- This is a web application that detects **damages** on mangoes using a TensorFlow model with Django as the frontend framework\n- Detecting different types of **damages** of roads like cracks and potholes for the given image/video of the road.\n\nExamples from GitHub where it seems to be used correctly in regard to financial compensation:\n- Code used for calculating **damages** in lost chance cases.\n- Where the dispute involves a claim for damages in respect of a motor accident for cost of rental of a replacement vehicle\n- Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to\ndefend claims against the other Contributors related to those\nperformance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other\nContributor to pay any **damages** as a result, the Commercial Contributor\nmust pay those **damages**.\n\nExamples from GitHub where it's not an error but a verb:\n- Profiles pb's and **damages** them when their runtime goes over a set value - sirhamsteralot/HaE-PBLimiter.\n- Opening Wayland-native terminal **damages** Firefox\n- Open File Requester **damages** underlaying windows when moved\n\nExamples from GitHub that are too hard to call - maybe they are talking about financial compensation?\n- The goal is to estimate the **damages** of each link in the Graph object using the **Damages** result (estimating the **damages** for each segment of a Network).\n- This repository contains code to conduct statistical inference in cartel **damages** estimation. It will be updated to include a Stata .do file which approximates the standard error of total **damages** from a fixed effects panel data model, using the delta method.\n- Financial **damages** caused by received errors $$$$\n- It would be useful to be able to see asset-level **damages** after running FDA 2.0.\n\n## Potential False Positives\n\n\"Damages\" is also the third-person singular present verb and is very common.\n\n",

The only meaning I know of for \"brandish\" is to carry a weapon. Checking some definitions it's more like \"wave a weapon threateningly\".\n\nApparently it's also used in a figurative sense in football (soccer) in reference to red cards and yellow cards.\n\n## Resources\n\nI can't find anybody discussing this yet. It must be quite new.\n\n## Examples\n\n- Unretire Gretzky's sweater . **Brandish** him a traitor.\n- lied to stop kuma's ideology from taking root and to **brandish** him a criminal that they could arrest\n- he was so afraid his thoughts could **brandish** him as a paedophile\n- Chanel Oberlin's reason for purposely leading on Pete Martinez in order to humiliate him and **brandish** him a registered sex offender\n- ?? spoke out over the move by Kenyans to continuously **brandish** him with nicknames even after ...\n- **brandish** him as an acclaimed symbol of humility, integrity and incorruptibility in the face of today's corrupt economic and political elite1\n- To attempt to **brandish** him as an “illegal immigrant” is absolutely ridiculous and warrants an immediate retraction and apology.\n- The small minded townsfolk **brandish** him with the nickname \"Genepool\" due to his physical and cognitive shortcomings.\n- One such reason that critics **brandish** him with this label is due to Peterson's opposition to Canada's Bill C-16\n\n## Potential False Positives\n\nIt will take some effort to detect the original correct usage and separate it from this new incorrect usage.",

The problem with this approach is that this would also match any regular Firefox browser.\r\n\r\nThe only other way I could think of would be checking whether the user traffic originates from a Tor exit node IP, which would be more complex and require maintaining a list of node IPs.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts on how to proceed?", "Hi @sea-kelp, since this check will happen server-side, we can replace the User-Agent inspection with an IP-based check against the list of known Tor exit nodes.\nTor Project maintains an up-to-date list of public exit node IPs, which we can fetch and cache periodically. Then, on each request, we can compare the client’s IP against that list.", "> Tor Project maintains an up-to-date list of public exit node IPs, which we can fetch and cache periodically. Then, on each request, we can compare the client’s IP against that list.\n\nI'm thinking about taking a shot at implementing this. But my impression is this code will be running behind an onion service, and connections to onion services don't go through exit nodes. If both of those are correct we're back to the problem @sea-kelp described. ", "It's been a while, but I'm not sure that (checking for exit node IPs) would solve the underlying issue anyway even if the source interface wasn't a hidden service. The intent was to steer people towards Tor Browser on desktop and away from Android Tor Browser, or Brave, or other alternatives - all of those would still route their traffic over Tor. We did make some changes to detect and block the use Tor2Web proxies and such already.\n\nMaybe the real issue here is whether that assumption (mobile browser Tor bad, desktop browser Tor good) still holds true in 2025." ],

      "repositoryName" : "linkerd/linkerd2",
      "description" : "### What is the issue?\n\nThe helm chart allows a string or an int for `controller.podDisruptionBudget.maxUnavailable` and linkerd will happily deploy with, for example, either `1` or `25%` for this value and the PDBs are defined accordingly and correctly.  However, as soon as a pod starts up where `linkerd-proxy` needs to be inject, the following error will occur\r\n```\r\nadmission webhook \"linkerd-proxy-injector.linkerd.io\" denied the request: failed to unmarshal JSON from: /var/run/linkerd/config/values: error unmarshaling JSON: while decoding JSON: json: cannot unmarshal string into Go struct field PodDisruptionBudget.controller.podDisruptionBudget.maxUnavailable of type int\r\n```\r\nIt appears to be related to the strict typing in Go here: https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/blob/0965da659b75ee347269743e350347e92cb0d316/pkg/charts/linkerd2/values.go#L96.\r\n\r\nSince k8s allows for percentages for PDBs, it seems the go code should be fixed to allow the same.  Either way, if linkerd injection is going to fail if a percent is used in the helm chart values, linkerd should fail to deploy due to the same.\n\n### How can it be reproduced?\n\nDefine a PDB using a percent, deploy and then attempt to inject `linkerd-proxy`.\n\n### Logs, error output, etc\n\nSee initial description.\n\n### output of `linkerd check -o short`\n\n```\r\n% linkerd check -o short\r\nlinkerd-version\r\n---------------\r\n‼ cli is up-to-date\r\n    unsupported version channel: stable-2.14.10\r\n    see https://linkerd.io/2.14/checks/#l5d-version-cli for hints\r\n\r\ncontrol-plane-version\r\n---------------------\r\n‼ control plane and cli versions match\r\n    control plane running edge-24.10.4 but cli running stable-2.14.10\r\n    see https://linkerd.io/2.14/checks/#l5d-version-control for hints\r\n\r\nlinkerd-control-plane-proxy\r\n---------------------------\r\n‼ control plane proxies and cli versions match\r\n    linkerd-destination-6cfbc66dcf-rfqw7 running edge-24.10.4 but cli running stable-2.14.10\r\n    see https://linkerd.io/2.14/checks/#l5d-cp-proxy-cli-version for hints\r\n\r\nlinkerd-ha-checks\r\n-----------------\r\n‼ pod injection disabled on kube-system\r\n    kube-system namespace needs to have the label config.linkerd.io/admission-webhooks: disabled if injector webhook failure policy is Fail\r\n    see https://linkerd.io/2.14/checks/#l5d-injection-disabled for hints\r\n\r\nlinkerd-viz\r\n-----------\r\n‼ viz extension proxies and cli versions match\r\n    metrics-api-6ddbbd456-tmtdq running edge-24.10.4 but cli running stable-2.14.10\r\n    see https://linkerd.io/2.14/checks/#l5d-viz-proxy-cli-version for hints\r\n\r\nStatus check results are √\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Environment\n\n% kubectl version\r\nClient Version: v1.28.2\r\nKustomize Version: v5.0.4-0.20230601165947-6ce0bf390ce3\r\nServer Version: v1.29.8-eks-a737599\n\n### Possible solution\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Would you like to work on fixing this bug?\n\nNone",

As I understand it, actually supporting the \"%\" form is less important to you than having the chart and the CRD be consistent, correct?", "It would be ideal to be able to use % so we don't have to change the value for `maxUnavailable` as we increase or decrease the number of replicas.  However, if % isn't going to be supported at injection time, the helm chart should not support it either so it's more consistent with a \"fail-fast\" paradigm.", "This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity. It will be closed in 14 days if no further activity occurs. Thank you for your contributions.\n", "I would like to provide a fix for this issue. My idea is to change the maxUnavailable to type IntOrString, like for the [PodDisruptionBudget type](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/dc19f0b6b9cd14ece6b1929cb4e7ea2c9d322b95/pkg/apis/policy/types.go#L43). Why do you think about that @alpeb? \n\nAlso for testing, do I need to generate a new type of golden file and test to cover the % or is there a better alternative?", "Thanks for taking this on, @wim-de-groot! Unfortunately, `values.go` is a bit of debt in the codebase. It's been a challenge to keep this typed go struct in sync with the `values.yml` used by the Helm charts and by the chart rendering done by the Linkerd CLI.  The only reason we keep it around is because setting fields into a typed go struct is more ergonomic than setting fields (especially deeply nested fields) into an untyped `map[string]interface{}`.\n\nWith that said, there's actually nowhere in our go codebase that we specifically set `maxUnavailable` so I think we can sidestep this issue by making the `Controller` field of the `Values` struct at `map[string]interface{}`.  You can see that we do the same thing for  `DeploymentStrategy` and follow that as an example.\n\nUpdating an existing test or adding a new one where we set a % based PDB in the values would be a good way to test this." ],

This could be done through a progress bar, dots, or a step indicator, and the tracker should dynamically update as the user progresses through the form's pages/screens. The goal is to make the user's progress clear and easily understandable, ensuring a smooth experience.\n\n### Why Is This Important\n- A visual progress indicator helps users understand where they are in the form and how many steps remain, reducing confusion.\n- The progress UI needs to be accessible, ensuring all users, including those with disabilities, can easily understand and track their progress.\n- Clear tracking of progress increases user satisfaction by providing transparency and reducing anxiety about completing the form.\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Implement a visual indicator showing the user’s current step in the form (ex. progress bar, dots or step indicator).\n- [ ] Ensure the tracker dynamically updates as the user moves through application pages/screens.\n- [ ] Make the application progress UI accessible and easy to understand.\n- [ ] Design is consistent with [Techtonica's branding guidelines](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/sb8ppa0qxuuott515euei/h?rlkey=1ghfh6urkf2rakbonngk9z3bd&st=xcbpfn8v&dl=0), if the design is not yet existent\n     - make a proposal for design and behavior that is in keeping with the existing design choices\n     - document design choice decision in a comment on this issue as well as in https://github.com/Techtonica/techtonica.org/issues/505\n\n### Related Tickets\n- Main Issue:  #389 \n- #556\n\n### Additional Notes\nThe person working on this issue may need to collaborate with whoever is handling issue #556 to ensure that the progress tracker integrates smoothly with the multi-page UI and save progress functionality.\n\nthis work will need to be pulled from the `mvp` branch and merged into the `mvp` branch\n\n",

I encourage you and anyone else involved with this form project to read through UK's documentation on [Structuring forms](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/form-structure). In particular, pay attention to their \"one thing per page\" philosophy. We want to guide potential participants through the process as much as possible and not overwhelm them with text or fields.\n\n> This is an excellent opportunity to implement some conditional logic and cut down on the walls of eligibility text and form fields. A gender identity question can be used to quickly disqualify anyone whose gender identity does not line up with the eligibility requirements, saving them an immense amount of time on a form they do not need to fill out. If they answer with an eligible value, move them onto the rest of the form. If they answer with a non-eligible value, show them copy similar to this and send them off on their way.\n\nthis work will need to be pulled from the `mvp` branch and merged into the `mvp` branch",

Please describe.**\r\nCurrently, the configuration file is in a flat yaml, and the config class is a flat dataclass. \r\nIt will become annoying to manage those configuration items as we add more configuration items.  \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nIn the proposed solution, the configuration should be organized into multiple sections. Here's an example design of sections:\r\n- Cache engine config, including chunk size, a list of backends to use, caching policy, etc\r\n- List of backend configs for each backend listed in cache engine config. It should include the max size, eviction policy, serde, etc\r\n- Blend config: configurations for KV blending functionality\r\n- LMCache server config (optional), including the configurations for the lmcache_server module\r\n\r\nOn the implementation side, this proposal includes two parts: what's the format of configuration file, and what will the configuration class look like.\r\n- For configuration file: use [toml](https://toml.io/en/) instead of plain yaml to support different sections\r\n- For configuration class: have a separate config class for each section, and have a main `LMCacheConfig` class to include all those sections.\r\n",

This is the GMS change I made to make that work: https://github.com/dolthub/go-mysql-server/pull/3046, but I realized that this was breaking a bunch of tests in Dolt for reasons I didn't expect, so I reverted it shortly thereafter: https://github.com/dolthub/go-mysql-server/pull/3056\n\nChanging the output of SET by itself will break many changes test in Dolt. Unfortunately I was actually trying to fix this issue, which is about the shell printing the right updates, so that got all jumbled up which let to a deeper issue which is that the `dolt sql` shell doesn't have the right information to determine when to print the Query OK line. Specifically, mysql shell will not print any of them if it's executing statements in a batch.\n\nThis is best shown here:\n\n```\n$ echo \"create table t (i int); drop table t;\" | mysql -u root -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3306 mydb\n$ mysql -u root -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3306 mydb\nWelcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \\g.\nYour MySQL connection id is 9\nServer version: 8.0.33 Dolt\n\nCopyright (c) 2000, 2023, Oracle and/or its affiliates.\n\nOracle is a registered trademark of Oracle Corporation and/or its\naffiliates. Other names may be trademarks of their respective\nowners.\n\nType 'help;' or '\\h' for help. Type '\\c' to clear the current input statement.\n\nmysql> create table t (i int);\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> drop table t;\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql>\n```\n\nYou can see that the output of the first command is empty. MySQL client knows that you are not in an interactive terminal. `dolt sql` shell doesn't actually know this, and as a result the changes I made to the shell break lots of tests because where ever we stream in statements, we print out `Query OK` in many places that aren't expected in tests.\n\nThe equivalent dolt operations:\n```\n$ echo \"create table t (i int); drop table t;\" | dolt sql\n\n\n$ dolt sql\n# Welcome to the DoltSQL shell.\n# Statements must be terminated with ';'.\n# \"exit\" or \"quit\" (or Ctrl-D) to exit. \"\\help\" for help.\nmydb/main> create table t (i int);\nEmpty set (0.01 sec)\n\nmydb/main*>  drop table t;\nEmpty set (0.01 sec)\n\nmydb/main>\n```\n\nAs you can see, there are empty lines printed in the pipe case, and \"Empty Set\" returned in the shell case. The changes proposed by James in https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/pull/9291 and ultimately what claude tried to do don't toggle based on if the input is a pipe or interactive, and as a result will always print `Query OK` - which is not only confusing, but breaks my dolt tests which don't expect them to be there\n\nNext Steps:\n - Get `dolt sql` wise to the way it's being operated. This may require looking at the mysql shell code, or something else. One way or another we need to be aware of when printing these things makes sense.\n - Apply the SET change to GMS, and isolate it to fixing tests only in Dolt and Doltgres. Don't modify the shell output at this stage because it breaks a lot of tests and become intractable.\n -  Update the shell, in the way proposed by James, to get the right information out in the right context.\n\nIn some of these changes, we are going to want to toggle behavior with an environment flag such that we won't stop the development train with broken builds. We kind of need better options to optionally enable behaviors while also getting them in the pipeline for testing." ],

Even then, this implementation would be \"local\", e.g. not synced with the current AWS API limits. Granted, those API limits would probably not change very often, yet someone would need to keep this intermediate layer in sync.\r\n\r\nMy proposal would be the following:\r\n\r\n- For those who cannot test such things in non-production environments, validate the API limits that you want to validate by adding the respective input/variable validation logic to your config (https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/expressions/custom-conditions)\r\n- Otherwise, use your non-production environment(s) to test/validate this against the SSOCT (single source of **current** truth) - the real AWS API.", "Marking this issue as stale due to inactivity.

Previously, the layout had inconsistent button sizes, lack of proper spacing, and weak visual hierarchy, making the interface less intuitive. These enhancements improve readability, accessibility, and overall user experience.\n\n**Changes Implemented**\n\nHeader Layout: Added a \"Group Name\" label, increased group name size, and aligned the primary mentor section for better structure.\n\nSection Styling: Introduced light gray backgrounds, subtle shadows, and better spacing to visually separate sections.\n\nButton Consistency: Standardized button sizes, improved alignment, and added hover effects.\n\nVisual Hierarchy: Improved typography, spacing, padding, and margins for a more professional look.\n\n**Screenshots**\n\nBefore:\n\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f082aa89-32c7-4bec-8907-a7fde0b66aa3\" />\n\nAfter:\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d40387fe-9941-4f29-9bcb-4e331ede97b4\n\nAdditional Context\n\nThese refinements contribute to a more structured and user-friendly experience, making navigation and interaction more seamless.\n\nAre you working on this issue?\n\n✅ Yes, I have implemented the changes and am submitting them for review.\n",

This regression might have been introduced in PR [#424](https://github.com/your-repo/your-project/pull/424). A possible (but unconfirmed) cause could be related to the handling of emoji suggestions for the last word — further debugging is required to verify this.\n\n#### Workaround\nExecuting the **plural** command with unknown words seems to restore the Enter key's normal behavior. This behavior is demonstrated in the attached video.\n\n#### Expected Behavior\nPressing the **Enter** key should insert a newline and move the cursor to the next line, maintaining standard input behavior.\n\n#### Attachments\n- Video demonstrating the bug and workaround\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/801cbea9-7138-4833-a1f0-dc6ca471b56b\n\n\n### Device type\n\nSamsung SM-921W\n\n### Versions\n\nandroid 15, Current version of main",

      "description" : "### Apache Airflow Provider(s)\n\nhttp\n\n### Versions of Apache Airflow Providers\n\n5.3.0\n\n### Apache Airflow version\n\n3.0.2\n\n### Operating System\n\nUbuntu 24.04.2 LTS\n\n### Deployment\n\nVirtualenv installation\n\n### Deployment details\n\n- **Deployment Type**: Virtualenv installation\n- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS\n- **Python Version**: 3.12.3\n- **Airflow Version**: 3.0.2\n- **HTTP Provider Version**: 5.3.0\n- **Database Backend**: PostgreSQL 16\n- **Secrets Backend**: Microsoft Azure Key Vault\n- **Authentication**: Flask AppBuilder (FAB) with Microsoft Entra ID (SSO)\n- **SSL Configuration**: Enabled with custom certificates\n- **Timezone**: Pacific/Auckland\n- **Airflow Services Management**: systemd unit files for `api-server`, `scheduler`, `dag-processor`, and `triggerer`\n- **Custom Configuration Highlights**:\n  - Airflow configuration (`airflow.cfg`) includes:\n    - `sql_alchemy_conn_secret` for DB connection string\n    - Azure Key Vault integration for secrets\n    - SSL cert/key paths\n    - FAB auth manager\n  - Environment variables for Azure credentials (`AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`)\n  - Custom `webserver_config.py` for SSO\n  - Firewall configured to allow port 8443\n\n### What happened\n\nI encountered an issue while using a deferrable `HttpSensor` in Airflow 3.0.2. The sensor is configured to use a connection (`https_host-has-no-schema`) with the following details:\n\n- **Host**: `dummyjson.com`\n- **Port**: `443`\n- **Schema**: `https`\n\nDuring the initial execution, the sensor correctly uses `HttpHook` to send a GET request to `https://dummyjson.com:443/fake_endpoint`, receives a 404 response, and defers the task as expected.\n\nHowever, when the deferred task resumes via `HttpSensorTrigger`, the trigger internally creates an `HttpAsyncHook` object. This hook retrieves the connection using `self.get_connection(self.http_conn_id)` but appears to lose the `schema` value. As a result, the final request URL becomes `http://dummyjson.com:443/fake_endpoint`, which is incorrect and causes unexpected behavior.\n\nThis discrepancy between `HttpHook` and `HttpAsyncHook` in handling the connection schema seems to stem from how the connection object is retrieved and interpreted asynchronously. The issue may involve `BaseHook.get_connection`, `Connection`, or `TaskSDKConnection` not properly preserving or propagating the `schema` field.\n\nHere’s a log fragment showing the incorrect behavior. The first request `https` but the second request is `http`.\n```log\n[2025-06-27, 01:46:26] INFO - Connection Retrieved 'https_host-has-no-schema': source=\"airflow.hooks.base\"\n[2025-06-27, 01:46:26] DEBUG - Connection Details: 'Connection(conn_id='https_host-has-no-schema', conn_type='http', description=None, host='dummyjson.com', schema='https', login=None, password=None, port=443, extra=None)': source=\"airflow.hooks.base\"\n[2025-06-27, 01:46:26] DEBUG - Sending 'GET' to url: https://dummyjson.com:443/fake_endpoint: source=\"airflow.task.hooks.airflow.providers.http.hooks.http.HttpHook\"\n......\n[2025-06-27, 01:46:31] INFO - Connection Retrieved 'https_host-has-no-schema': source=\"airflow.hooks.base\"\n[2025-06-27, 01:46:31] DEBUG - Connection Details: 'Connection(conn_id='https_host-has-no-schema', conn_type='http', description=None, host='dummyjson.com', schema=None, login=None, password=None, port=443, extra=None)': source=\"airflow.hooks.base\"\n[2025-06-27, 01:46:31] WARNING - [Try 1 of 3] Request to http://dummyjson.com:443/fake_endpoint failed.: source=\"airflow.providers.http.hooks.http.HttpAsyncHook\"\n```\n\n### What you think should happen instead\n\nThe expected behavior is that both HttpHook and HttpAsyncHook should consistently respect the schema field defined in the Airflow connection. In this case, the connection https_host-has-no-schema explicitly sets schema=https, so all HTTP requests — synchronous or asynchronous — should use https:// in the final URL.\n\n### How to reproduce\n\n1. **Create an Airflow connection** named `https_host-has-no-schema` with the following settings:\n   - **Host**: `dummyjson.com`\n   - **Port**: `443`\n   - **Schema**: `https`\n   - Leave login, password, and extra fields empty.\n\n2. **Create a DAG** with the following code:\n\n   ```python\n   from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n   from airflow import DAG\n   from airflow.providers.http.sensors.http import HttpSensor\n   from airflow.providers.http.operators.http import HttpOperator\n\n   with DAG(\n       dag_id=\"dag_reproduce_issue\",\n       description=\"Reproduce\",\n       start_date=datetime.now() - timedelta(days=1),\n       schedule=None,\n       catchup=False,\n       default_args={\n           \"retries\": 0,\n           \"retry_delay\": timedelta(minutes=1),\n       },\n       tags=[\"reproduce_issue\"],\n   ) as dag:\n\n       https_operator = HttpOperator(\n           task_id=\"https_operator\",\n           http_conn_id=\"https_host-has-no-schema\",\n           endpoint=\"products\",\n           method=\"GET\",\n       )\n\n       https_sensor = HttpSensor(\n           task_id=\"https_sensor\",\n           http_conn_id=\"https_host-has-no-schema\",\n           endpoint=\"fake_endpoint\",\n           method=\"GET\",\n           deferrable=True,\n           poke_interval=30,\n           timeout=60,\n       )\n\n       https_operator >> https_sensor\n   ```\n\n3. **Run the DAG**. Observe the following:\n   - `https_operator` sends a request to `https://dummyjson.com:443/products` and succeeds.\n   - `https_sensor` initially sends a request to `https://dummyjson.com:443/fake_endpoint`, receives a 404, and defers.\n   - When resumed by `HttpSensorTrigger`, the request is sent to `http://dummyjson.com:443/fake_endpoint` instead of `https`.\n\n4. **Check the logs** of the triggerer process to confirm the incorrect URL schema.\n\n### Anything else\n\nThis issue occurs **every time** under the following conditions:\n\n- The Airflow connection's **host** field does **not include a URL schema** (i.e., no `http://` or `https://`).\n- The **schema** field in the connection is explicitly set to `https`.\n- The `HttpSensor` is set to `deferrable=True`. I did not test when `deferrable=False`.\n\nUnder these conditions, the `HttpAsyncHook` used by `HttpSensorTrigger` fails to apply the `https` schema and defaults to `http`, resulting in incorrect request URLs.\n\nHowever, if the host is set to `https://dummyjson.com` (i.e., includes the schema directly in the host field), the issue does **not** occur. In that case, both the host and port are correctly loaded and used by `HttpAsyncHook`.\n\nTo better observe this behavior, it is recommended to enable **DEBUG logging level** in Airflow. This will show the full request URL constructed by the hook and confirm whether the schema is being applied correctly.\n\n### Are you willing to submit PR?\n\n- [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n",

Since it uses generative AI, the responses can vary significantly each time.\n\nThis test case type is better suited for evaluating whether a question is answered or not, along with a few other predefined outcome types.\n\nI tried simulating your test scenario and observed some variation in the responses as well. Hope this explanation helps clarify things!\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56139a8b-d7ea-4a51-8573-cc34a7b2f29b)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8185651-4b10-4428-95b5-141a6dd9b096)", "Hi @ShrutiGoswami17, \nJust a quick reminder regarding the Generative Answers test case. I wanted to check if my previous explanation addressed your concern. If you still have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to let us know. " ],

This way BigQuery can be used as a source of truth for these values.\r\n\r\nOther database drivers could then follow a similar model, for example Postgres has comment fields which can be expected to have the same structured JSON message if the driver is switched to propagate Data Model annotations from the source system table metadata.\r\n\r\nIs this a good proposal? If so I could contribute it. I couldn't find any existing discussion on this in the issues you linked or via a quick search.", "@muscovitebob Since that would be completely specific to Metabase, then I don't see why you wouldn't just set this information directly in the Metabase application database (or via API).\r\nBut it's a different topic than this issue, and perhaps related to issue 5163 and probably other issues too.\r\nIt sounds like a fine idea, but should probably have it's own issue.", "It would mostly be handy to let people avoid writing API syncers for information Metabase already theoretically has access to.

Policies are defined in YAML and \nsent over gRPC to the local KubeArmor agent.\n\nSubcommands:                                                                                 <- content of long description\n  • add     Apply a new policy from a YAML file (kubearmor vm policy add <file>)\n  • delete  Remove an existing policy by its YAML file (kubearmor vm policy delete <file>)\n\nGlobal Flags:                                                                                 <- content of long description\n  • --gRPC <address>   Address of the KubeArmor gRPC server (host:port)\n\nExamples:\n  # Apply a file‑access policy on a standalone host:\n  karmor vm policy add ./file-access.yaml --gRPC 127.0.0.1:50051\n\n  # Remove that policy when finished:\n  karmor vm policy delete ./file-access.yaml --gRPC 127.0.0.1:50051\n\nSee each subcommand's help for more details:\n  karmor vm policy add --help\n  karmor vm policy delete --help\n\nUsage:\n  karmor vm policy [command]\n\nAvailable Commands:                                                                            <- generated by Cobra\n  add         add policy for non kubernetes/bare metal KubeArmor\n  delete      delete policy for non kubernetes/bare metal KubeArmor\n  get         get policy for bare-metal vm/kvms control plane vm\n\nFlags:                                                                                         <- generated by Cobra\n      --gRPC string   gRPC server information\n  -h, --help          help for policy\n\nGlobal Flags:                                                                                  <- generated by Cobra\n      --context string      Name of the kubeconfig context to use\n      --kubeconfig string   Path to the kubeconfig file to use\n\nUse \"karmor vm policy [command] --help\" for more information about a command.\n```\nManually added Long description currently contains:\n\n- Description of command\n- Subcommands: add, delete, etc.\n- Global Flags: --gRPC, etc.\n- Example Usage\n\nThese are also automatically rendered by Cobra, making their inclusion in Long unnecessary. We only need Description and Example Usage\n\n## Proposed Change:\nRefactor the Long descriptions for CLI commands to contain only:\n\n- Command overview\n- Example for usage\n\nRemove manually added subcommands and global flags from the long description.\n\nThis will ensure the CLI help remains clean, DRY, and easier to maintain.\n\nThanks!",

The X axis only shows periods present in the query result, so if the last month is missing from your chart, it's probably not included in the query output. This can happen if the time range end boundary is exclusive or if the SQL time grain logic doesn't generate a row for the last month.\n\nThere have been recent fixes that may help: one ensures all x-axis date labels for the selected time grain are displayed ([PR 33191](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/33191)), and another adds an option to show all X axis ticks on timeseries charts ([PR 33729](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/33729)). Make sure your deployment includes these changes and try enabling the new X axis tick display option if it's available.\n\nIf the issue persists, check the SQL generated for your chart to confirm the last month is included in the result set. Adjusting the time range or time grain settings may help. If you need the last month to appear even when there is no data, you would need to pad missing periods in your dataset or adjust the backend query to generate all expected periods, as the frontend does not do this automatically.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

The backend time grain logic (including \"month\") is handled in `superset/db_engine_specs/base.py` [[source]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/2e9939baf253e607a54722b1996baaf625e72133/superset/db_engine_specs/base.py).\n\nTo fix this, check the SQL generated for your chart and make sure the last month is included in the result set. If your time range is exclusive at the end, try making it inclusive. If you want the last month to appear even when there is no data, you’ll need to pad missing periods in the backend query (e.g., generate a series of all expected months and left join your data onto it). There isn’t a built-in frontend option to do this automatically.\n\nIf you want to explore a frontend solution, you’d need to modify the logic in `extractSeries` to inject missing periods, but this is usually best handled on the backend for consistency across all visualizations.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

Do you know how I can approach that?\r\n\r\nAlso correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems the intention of the ticket is the following: \r\n1) Application (Managing Appprojects) - Gets a Delete request from CLI,UI, etc.\r\n2) Application - Gets a finalizer/enters deleting state, and then starts processing it's live objects \r\n3) AppProject Deletion - Gets a finalizer/enters deleting state \r\n4) Check for Apps - Check to see if any apps reference the AppProject\r\n- If yes, skip removing finalizer + skip deletion\r\n- If no, remove finalizer + delete project\r\n\r\nFYI, I'm sure I'm slightly incorrect on some of the above details, but let me know. Thanks!!!", "Nvm, I managed to figure out/resolve the issue.

Basically, a project being removed from Pruning. Writing the e2e will allow you to test the scenarios and will also be useful to validate the implementation.\n\nI think this code will not be reached since the resource wont have a finalizer added to it. This enhancement is to always add a finalizer when the AppProject is deleted (or maybe add it when it is created?) to perform the validation since Argo CD is the controller responsible for the AppProject." ],

I will give it all some more consideration as I get more comfortable with the codebase. For now, I'd like to try updating the mirror button. Is there a specific ticket?", "Aand two more types of tasks:\r\n- <b> just `repo managment:`</b> reviewing [PRs](https://github.com/code-charity/youtube/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc).  And if you want you can join us to set https://github.com/code-charity/youtube/labels, closing issues, etc. \r\n- <b> `managing (old & new) code:`</b> [example](https://github.com/code-charity/youtube/pull/2157)", "hi! @xiomaraR,  thanks and glad if it wasn't too much to read. Let's make this list of types of tasks a [wiki page](https://github.com/code-charity/youtube/wiki) here?\r\nWe don't have a mirror button yet. (closed #80. Once added, we can checkbox it above.)  \r\n - You could start with a [copy of the rotate button](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Acode-charity%2Fyoutube+rotate_button&type=code), adjusting the names & CSS-injection. \r\n   - The function in player.js is the main thing; in our menu Mirror can be listed below Rotate (and you don't have to add it to all the language files, but only to /en/messages.json;  while the first search result (\"core.js\") is only for this: \"// REACTION OR VISUAL FEEDBACK WHEN THE USER CHANGES A SETTING (already automated for our CSS features)\" ) as written above it</i>)\r\n   - So while wanted & minimal, it is ultimately a task AI should do. And for you personally it might only serve to get familiar with webExtensions & this repo (i saw you have a github history\uD83D\uDC4D).  And mirror isn't immediately a unique feature (existing solution with 30 000 users, forgot to link it at first).  So, while i initially though of suggesting Mirror as a beginner-friendly example, it ended up as an example for this type of task instead ( `Assessing / Re-evaluating plans`) <br> and i added this sub-task: (<a href=\"https://github.com/code-charity/youtube/issues/1445#:~:text=remember%20per%20video%20or%20per%20loop%2C%20if%20a%20loop%20is%20set.%20Compare%3A%20mirrortube\"> above </a>)\r\n      - > - [ ] remember per video or per selection, if a loop is or will be set too for this video.  (compare:  [mirrortube](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/mirrortube/pdebhiihcebhmcpmdncgfodomdnhbehj) )\r\n         -   <i> Once we will have that too, it will be a unique product, improvement to all users.  \r\n             -  aand this makes me remember to add:   \" - [ ] transpose.  Compare: [transpose pitch speed loop](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/transpose-%E2%96%B2%E2%96%BC-pitch-%E2%96%B9-spee/ioimlbgefgadofblnajllknopjboejda) (700 000 users)  (Once we add all three things, that would apparently make this extension the best youtube extension for musicians already.) </i>\r\n       - So that will be amazing but take 2 or more tasks, which is why it wasn't among the first 3 examples i mentioned:\r\n         AFAIK `pause while typing` will be unique.  And `moving Subtitles/Captions` below the player will be unique too. (remembered these through checking the labels: #unique, #set&forget, #plan-ready)\r\n         - and we can search more specifically:  [is:open `milestone:\"Little or easy(?)\"` `label:\"\uD83E\uDDE9Plan ready\"` -`label:\"Rare use-case?\"`](https://github.com/code-charity/youtube/issues?q=is%3Aopen+milestone%3A%22Little+or+easy%28%3F%29%22+label%3A%22%F0%9F%A7%A9Plan+ready%22+-label%3A%22Rare+use-case%3F%22+)  \r\n           - so (surprise!) we find the frequent wish of [a shortcut for the rotate button](https://github.com/code-charity/youtube/issues/1699#issuecomment-1751485020)!, part of which you can copy paste in our [shortcuts.js](https://github.com/code-charity/youtube/blob/master/js%26css/web-accessible/www.youtube.com/shortcuts.js?rgh-link-date=2023-10-06T23%3A02%3A12Z).     \r\n         - More over the following player button will be a novelty, since YouTube didn't always provide the headmap:\r\n              - > - [ ] Skip to next key scene data-source: https://github.com/code-charity/youtube/issues/1463 \r\n           -  So this 3rd example, seemed best to suggest,  since this one could (optionally) directly inspire various `Development / engineering`-thoughts. And i and we can join the work /your PRs \r\n              - While working with the JSON will require some more lines of code, but it is typical work. (Q&A/stackoverlow & AI/ chatgpt will help at need);  (and it doesn't help to know this repo yet since we are lacking a data framework. https://github.com/code-charity/youtube/blob/9266d8dfe76eaec30936b4efffcfe931c3c60337/js%26css/web-accessible/www.youtube.com/player.js#L137 ) \r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n" ],

Then if I understand this correctly, when de-serializing the persisted state, every `ChannelMonitorUpdateStep` for a `ChannelMonitor` is replayed so that we build up to the state we had before the last shutdown. Then, the solution you propose would be to\r\n- Add a new property `allow_automated_broadcast` to `ChannelMonitorImpl` that defaults to `true`\r\n- On `update_monitor`, when matching `ChannelForceClosed` with `should_broadcast: false` set the flag to `false`\r\n- On `broadcast_latest_holder_commitment_txn` check for the flag and if it's `false` then... `log_info!` and do nothing?\r\n\r\nSome questions I have:\r\n- It feels odd to have a method called `braodcast...` that won't _always_ broadcast. Should we either:\r\n  - Rename the method to `maybe_broadcast_latest_holder_commitment_txn`, so that it's explicit that under certain conditions it will not broadcast?\r\n  - Define a new method `maybe_broadcast...` that wraps up the current one but checks the flag first and use this new method in this specific use case?\r\n  \r\n  I'm also asking because the method is also called  when the de-serialized `ChannelManager` is stale compared to the `ChannelMonitor`, though in this case there is a channel in the  founding transactions set ([lines 6789-6804](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/blob/79e2af949700281b7333f202a7292e3bf81dc674/lightning/src/ln/channelmanager.rs#L6789-L6805)). I assume in that case too we want the flag to stop us, but I want to make sure I'm not changing some important semantics.\r\n- Is there any other `ChannelMonitorUpdateStep` that would imply that it's safe again to broadcast? Looking at the docs for the Enum I would guess no, but asking just in case.", "Heh, 1564 didn't resolve this, it just referenced it...", "Yes, your understanding is correct, as for your questions:\r\n\r\n> It feels odd to have a method called braodcast... that won't always broadcast. Should we either:\r\n\r\nProbably the second, its still important that users be able to broadcast the latest state if they want to, so we at least need an option to broadcast the state, though it also wouldn't be unreasonable to split it into two methods - `maybe_` and `force_..._unsafe` to indicate that the first will only work if we think its okay to do so, and the second will force it to happen even if its unsafe to do so.\r\n\r\n> I'm also asking because the method is also called when the de-serialized ChannelManager is stale compared to the ChannelMonitor, though in this case there is a channel in the founding transactions set ([lines 6789-6804](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/blob/79e2af949700281b7333f202a7292e3bf81dc674/lightning/src/ln/channelmanager.rs#L6789-L6805)). I assume in that case too we want the flag to stop us, but I want to make sure I'm not changing some important semantics.\r\n\r\nI think in that case, yes, the flag should stop us (though of course generally the flag is not set).\r\n\r\n> Is there any other ChannelMonitorUpdateStep that would imply that it's safe again to broadcast? Looking at the docs for the Enum I would guess no, but asking just in case.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo, once its unsafe its unsafe. Unsafe here means we've lost some data, there's no way to recover that data.", "Great. I'll get to work into the PR then. Thanks!", "I'm having a hard time trying to test the code. I'll keep working on it but I'm posting my progress here in case anyone wants to throw help/comments/ideas. My idea would be to cover this new behavior with a simple unit test that:\r\n- Builds a `ChannelMonitor`\r\n- Sends it a `ForceClosed{should_broadcast: false}`\r\n- Writes and reads it again\r\n- And then tries to call the new methods and asserts whether the transaction was broadcasted.\r\n\r\nMy plan was to copy and adapt some other other unit test for `broadcast_latest_holder_commitment_txn` but couldn't find any. If I understand correctly, you write unit tests for this at the end of the module and integration tests in separate modules, mostly in `funcional_tests.rs`.

My DAG configs were: retries=1000, retry_delay=5 min (300 seconds), max_retry_delay=1h (3600 seconds). My DAG failed ~1000 times and after that Scheduler broke down. After that retries exceeded 1000 and stopped on 1017 retry attempt. \n\nI did my research on this problem and found that this happened due to formula **min_backoff = math.ceil(delay.total_seconds() * (2 ** (self.try_number - 1)))** in **taskinstance.py** file. So retry_exponential_backoff has no limit of try_number and during calculations it can overflow max Float value. So even if max_retry_delay is set formula is still calculating. And during calculations on very large retry number it crashes.\n\nPlease fix bug. \n\nI also did pull request with my possible solution:\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/48057\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/48051\n\nFrom Airflow logs:\n2024-12-09 02:16:39.825\tOverflowError: cannot convert float infinity to integer\n2024-12-09 02:16:39.825\t    min_backoff = int(math.ceil(delay.total_seconds() * (2 ** (self.try_number - 2))))\n2024-12-08 09:29:14.583\t[2024-12-08T06:29:14.583+0000] {scheduler_job_runner.py:705} INFO - Executor reports execution of mydag.spark_submit run_id=manual__2024-11-02T10:19:30.618008+00:00 exited with status up_for_retry for try_number 470\n\nConfigs: \n_with DAG(\n            dag_id=DAG_ID,\n            start_date=MYDAG_START_DATE,\n            schedule_interval=\"@daily\",\n            catchup=AIRFLOW_CATCHUP,\n            default_args={\n                'depends_on_past': True,\n                \"retries\": 1000,\n                \"retry_delay\": duration(minutes=5),\n                \"retry_exponential_backoff\": True,\n                \"max_retry_delay\": duration(hours=1),\n            },\n    ) as dag:_\n\n<img width=\"947\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3307b23-0307-4b4d-b968-3e1984fbe93c\" />\n<img width=\"1050\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f161329c-155c-4d92-b3b4-cf442d6ed036\" />\n\n### What you think should happen instead?\n\nMy pull request: \nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/48057\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/48051\n\n### How to reproduce\n\nUse configs from above.

      "description" : "# GPU Support for the Ersilia Model Hub\n\n## Background\n\nCurrently, the Ersilia Model Hub does not support GPU acceleration, which limits the performance of some models — and makes others completely unusable. Models are currently packaged as CPU-only Docker images. The goal of this project is to evaluate and implement GPU support using Docker.\n\n## Goals\n\n- Demonstrate that a model can run inside a Docker container with GPU access.\n- Build the foundation to support GPU in the Ersilia infrastructure (template, CLI, metadata, CI/CD).\n- Benchmark performance between CPU and GPU runs.\n\n## Step 1: Manual GPU Docker Test (Top-Down)\n\nWe will first verify that models can run in a GPU-enabled Docker container, without relying on Ersilia's internal infrastructure (e.g., CLI or model template).\n\n- [ ] Select two test models:\n  - [ ] One **GPU-only** model (TBD).\n  - [ ] One **GPU/CPU-compatible** model (suggested: FAISS-based).\n- [ ] Set up the new GPU workstation.\n- [ ] Choose and test an appropriate CUDA base image (e.g., `nvidia/cuda:...`).\n- [ ] Ensure image size is acceptable (<~4GB ideally).\n- [ ] Run tests on:\n  - [ ] At least two local GPU workstations.\n  - [ ] One cloud instance (e.g., AWS GPU instance).\n\n## Step 2: Integrate GPU Support into Ersilia Infrastructure\n\n### \uD83E\uDDF1 At the [Ersilia Template](https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos-template) level\n\n- [ ] How should `install.yml` indicate GPU requirements?\n- [ ] If model code differs between CPU/GPU, how should this be reflected in the `framework/`?\n\n### ⚙️ At the [Ersilia CLI](https://github.com/ersilia-os/ersilia) level\n\n- [ ] Add support for `--gpu` or `--cpu` flags in the `ersilia serve` command.\n- [ ] Decide whether GPU/CPU mode should be:\n  - Explicit (user-defined via flag), or\n  - Automatic (detect from hardware?)\n- [ ] Assess: Can one image support both CPU and GPU, or do we need separate ones?\n\n### \uD83D\uDCE6 At the [Ersilia Metadata](https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos5axz/blob/main/metadata.json) level\n\n- [ ] Add `runtime: GPU` / `CPU` or similar field.\n- [ ] Consider `requirements` or `compatibility` sections if needed.\n\n### \uD83D\uDC33 On [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/ersiliaos)\n\n- [ ] Should GPU-compatible images use a separate tag (e.g., `model:gpu`) or separate repo?\n- [ ] Define tagging convention early.\n\n## Step 3: GitHub Actions & CI Integration\n\nIn the [Ersilia Model Workflows](https://github.com/ersilia-os/ersilia-model-workflows):\n\n- [ ] Detect whether a model supports GPU.\n- [ ] Build and push a GPU-compatible Docker image (using `nvidia-docker`).\n- [ ] Ensure existing workflows are not broken.\n\nIn the [Ersilia CLI CI/CD](https://github.com/ersilia-os/ersilia):\n\n- [ ] Add at least one unit test to check GPU execution (on GitHub-hosted runners or self-hosted runner with GPU).\n\n## Step 4: Benchmarking & Validation\n\n- [ ] Run performance benchmarks:\n  - CPU vs GPU execution time.\n  - Memory consumption and constraints.\n- [ ] Record any limitations or environment-specific requirements.",

For example : \n\n```nvidia/cuda:12.9.0-runtime-ubuntu24.04```\n\nThis comes to ~ 2 GB/3 GB depending on the exact CUDA and Ubuntu Version being used. \n\nIdeally run automated tests/builds for different combinations of Ubuntu (or other distributions?) and CUDA  versions. \n\n## CPU vs GPU preliminary testing\n\nA very simple test on TabPFN using a [Sci-Kit Learn Breast Cancer Dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html) showed approximately 3x-4x speed ups when GPU access to the process was enabled, compared to CPU only runs (on the Norrsken GPU Workstation).\n\nMore detailed tests using a [Dataset of approximately 2 Million Compounds](https://github.com/ersilia-os/sars-cov-2-chemspace/blob/main/data/reference_library_inchikeys.csv) showed overwhelming speed-ups with GPU Accelerated similarity searches using [FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss), the difference between search times of GPU and CPU implementations scaled/diverged with the Index size. **It is clearly worth trying to accelerate models using GPU Acceleration.**\n\nWe built indices out of Count Fingerprints of the compounds (converted the SMILES to 2048 Vectors). Cosine Similarity was used as a metric. \n\nFAISS does not support cosine by default, so we use  an `Inner Product` index and perform L2 (Euclidean) Normalisation on the vectors before adding to them to the index (or before searching), which is the equivalent of using Cosine similarity.\n\nTests were ran with index sizes of `10,000`, `100,000`, `500,000` and `1,000,000`. Nearest 100 Neighbours. \n\n### Index size 100,000:\n| Number of Searches | CPU (s) | GPU (s) |\n|--------------------|---------|---------|\n| 100                | 1       | 0.01    |\n| 1,000              | 7.08    | 0.04    |\n| 10,000             | 67.49   | 0.11    |\n| 100,000            | >350    | 1.30    |\n| 500,000            | -       | 5.50    |\n\n### Index size 1,000,000\n\n| Number of Searches | CPU (s) | GPU (s) |\n|--------------------|---------|---------|\n| 100                | 9.42    | 0.02    |\n| 1,000              | 71      | 0.10    |\n| 10,000             | 711     | 1.03    |\n| 100,000            | -       | 10.45   |\n| 500,000            | -       | 52.50   |\n\n\n\n### \n\n<img width=\"765\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e39adae0-7c06-43ba-ba5f-3da89037da02\" />\n\n_NOTE: GPUs are typically higher latency but have higher parallel throughput and memory bandwidth than CPUs. It is best to use batch queries with the CPU or GPU as this amortises the touching of index memory across all of the queries and this is when GPU speed ups are convenient. We will most likely not see any improvements in GPU search times with single queries (if anything it might be slower because of GPU overhead)._\n\n\nThe examples of inference time comparisons and a 3D plot (inference time against index and query sizes), clearly demonstrate **GPUs provide absolutely non-trivial speed ups for the right tasks.**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "# Very Heavy Index (FAISS Flat)\n\nFlat (IP and L2 for example) indices are extremely large (because FAISS only supports Float32 vectors, hence each Fingerprint vector is 32 * 2048 = 65,536 Bits or 4 * 2048=8,192  Bytes), scaling up to millions of vectors means we are dealing with indices that are 10s of GBs.\n\nTried FPSim2 but there are no benefits to GPU accelerating since it does not support batch queries (could be worth looking into CUDA Programming and tuning it to support batch queries, as it supports Sparse Vectors and Tanimoto Search on GPU)\n\n## Promising alternative to Flat FAISS Index: **Approximate Nearest Neighbour (ANN) search**\n\nMost methods for ANN require index training and parameter tuning which makes building the index more complex. We also need to ensure that the training sample is diverse. \n\nPlease note the difference between training and adding to Indices. And index cannot be trained incrementally but can be incrementally added to.\n\nMemory bottlenecks are also an issue so I first train the index and then add vectors to it incrementally in batches. (Although, it is suggested, If possible at all,  add more compute at index build time. (Especially if the index does not change a lot over time))\n\nThe following ANN methods are explored and suggested (compared to ~16 GB with a flat index of around 1.99 million Vectors)\n\n### **_IVFPQ (Inverted File Index with Product Quantisation):_** \n\n#### **_I am yet to do Accuracy tests on IVFPQ but with computational performance (inference time), models seem to enjoy GPU Acceleration speed ups similar to those mentioned above for FAISS Flat indices._**\n\nThis creates very light indices: `~93 MB for an index of around 1.99 Million Vectors`, but there might be a non-trivial loss of accuracy. \n\nNote: For some reason after the index is trained and incrementally built, FAISS takes a lot of time to write it to disk which makes it look like the process is frozen but isn't actually frozen - it goes into an \"uninterruptible sleep\" because of Disk IO, as indicated by the \"D\" state in htop. \n\n### **_HNSWSQ (Hierarchical Navigable Small World Index with Scalar Quantisation)_**\n\nTraining is reasonably fast (with GPU) but adding vectors is computationally intensive and needs to batched appropriately.\n\n#### **_I am yet to do Accuracy tests on HNSWSQ but with computational performance , HNSW seem to enjoy GPU Acceleration only with at Training time as indices are pretty compact and are VERY FAST with CPU and FAISS does not have a GPU search for this yet._**\n\nWhen choosing the strength of quantisation, there is a trade off between memory and accuracy:\n\nIndex of **1.99 million Vectors**:\n\n```\n4.63 GB (~2KB Per Vector + overhead) with a  8-Bit Quantiser while maintaining around 95-98% Accuracy^\n\n\n\n2.59 GB (~1.15KB Per Vector + overhead) with a 4-Bit Quantiser  while maintaining around 90-95% Accuracy^\n```\n\n\nAdding vectors to this kind of index is slow.\n\n_^accuracy according to official documentation and third party tests_\n", "# Metric Learning - Embedding Model\n\nAnother alternative to using vanilla flat indices with 2048 dimensional fingerprints we explore is the use of a metric learning model to create embeddings that are lower dimensions. We use these embeddings to create flat FAISS indices that are much lighter than the standard fingerprint indices (512, 256, 128, 100 dimensional embeddings vs 2048 dimensional fingerprints). We uses torch's GPU version and enjoy non-trivial speed-ups at training time, while creating embeddings and inference time (FAISS Search using a GPU index).\n\nNote: The searches are performed on a flat index, hence are exact searches, but the using of the embedding model means there is an approximation.", "We are aiming to create compound similarity search models with 4 compound libraries:\n\n- ChemDiv (100k)\n- A representative of Enamine  (~9 million)\n- DrugBank (~11k)\n- COCONUT (should be between 500k and 1 Million)\n\nWe also create a _Metric Learning Embedding Model_ out of a [reference library of 2 million compounds.](https://github.com/ersilia-os/sars-cov-2-chemspace/blob/main/data/reference_library_inchikeys.csv).\n\nFor each of the above libraries the aim is to have 3 variants of indices:\n\n- _A flat IP index with L2 Normalisation_\n    - This is going to be very large for libraries with 500k+ compounds)\n\n- _A compressed IVFPQ IP index  with L2 normalisation (FAISS compression)_\n   - This creates very light indices but as mentioned above there is a loss of search accuracy\n\n- _A flat index created with embeddings from the above mentioned model._\n   - This is lets us create indices that are lighter than vanilla flat indices and also lets us have control and confidence over the accuracy of the search (given that we are confident in the embedding model, which is arguably simpler to benchmark).\n \n", "Implemented a metric learning pipeline that creates learned embeddings from existing flat FAISS index. \n\n### Transforms 2048-dimensional fingerprints → _256/128/100-dimensional learned embeddings_ with cosine similarity\n\n### Triplet sampling: Uses existing 2M compound FAISS index for mining hard positives/negatives\n\nEvaluations: ROC-AUC, AP, distance distributions, t-SNE visualizations\n\nThe pipeline maintains L2 normalization throughout for FlatIP cosine similarity and includes model checkpointing + SMILES mapping for deployment.\n\nCreated with PyTorch + FAISS GPU.

      "description" : "## Description\n\nThis is a feature request to add SHA-512 hash algorithm support to Trivy's SBOM parsing capabilities. Currently, Trivy only supports SHA-1, SHA-256, and MD5 hash algorithms when processing SBOM files.\n\nSome tools, particularly NPM's SBOM generation (`npm sbom`), use SHA-512 hashes for package integrity verification. Adding SHA-512 support would enable Trivy to fully process these SBOMs and preserve important security metadata.\n\n### Current limitations:\n- **CycloneDX**: SHA-512 hashes are ignored and the hashes field becomes `null`\n- **SPDX**: SHA-512 checksums are completely omitted from the output\n\n\n## Current Behavior\n\n### CycloneDX\nIn `pkg/sbom/cyclonedx/unmarshal.go:251-268`, the `unmarshalHashes` function only supports:\n- SHA1\n- SHA256\n- MD5\n\nAny other algorithm (including SHA-512) logs a warning but still creates a digest with an empty algorithm prefix (e.g., `:hashvalue` instead of `sha512:hashvalue`), resulting in malformed digest strings.\n\n### SPDX\nIn `pkg/sbom/spdx/marshal.go:501-522`, the `spdxChecksums` function has the same limitation, returning `nil` for unsupported algorithms.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe limitation stems from `pkg/digest/digest.go` which only defines three algorithms:\n```go\nconst (\n    SHA1   Algorithm = \"sha1\"\n    SHA256 Algorithm = \"sha256\"\n    MD5    Algorithm = \"md5\"\n)\n```\n\n## Desired Behavior\n\nTrivy should support SHA-512 hash algorithm alongside the existing SHA-1, SHA-256, and MD5 support. This would enable Trivy to:\n- Preserve SHA-512 hashes when processing SBOMs from NPM and other tools\n- Generate SBOMs with SHA-512 hashes when appropriate\n- Maintain full compatibility with CycloneDX and SPDX specifications\n\n\n## Impact\n\n- Loss of package integrity verification data\n- Generated SBOMs may be invalid or incomplete\n- Affects tools that rely on SHA-512 for security validation\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n1. Add SHA512 constant to `pkg/digest/digest.go`:\n   ```go\n   const (\n       SHA1   Algorithm = \"sha1\"\n       SHA256 Algorithm = \"sha256\"\n       SHA512 Algorithm = \"sha512\"\n       MD5    Algorithm = \"md5\"\n   )\n   ```\n\n2. Add SHA-512 calculation support in the digest package\n\n3. Update `unmarshalHashes` in CycloneDX:\n   ```go\n   case cdx.HashAlgoSHA512:\n       alg = digest.SHA512\n   ```\n\n4. Update `spdxChecksums` in SPDX:\n   ```go\n   case digest.SHA512:\n       alg = spdx.SHA512\n   ```\n\n## References\n\n- NPM SBOM documentation: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npm-sbom\n- CycloneDX hash algorithm specification: https://cyclonedx.org/docs/1.6/json/#components_items_hashes\n- SPDX checksum specification: https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/package-information/#79-package-checksum-field\n\n## Test Data\n\n### CycloneDX Example\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"http://cyclonedx.org/schema/bom-1.5.schema.json\",\n  \"bomFormat\": \"CycloneDX\",\n  \"specVersion\": \"1.5\",\n  \"components\": [\n    {\n      \"bom-ref\": \"lodash@4.17.21\",\n      \"type\": \"library\",\n      \"name\": \"lodash\",\n      \"version\": \"4.17.21\",\n      \"hashes\": [\n        {\n          \"alg\": \"SHA-512\",\n          \"content\": \"bf690311ee7b95e713ba568322e3533f2dd1cb880b189e99d4edef13592b81764daec43e2c54c61d5c558dc5cfb35ecb85b65519e74026ff17675b6f8f916f4a\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### SPDX Example\n```json\n{\n  \"spdxVersion\": \"SPDX-2.3\",\n  \"packages\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"lodash\",\n      \"SPDXID\": \"SPDXRef-Package-lodash-4.17.21\",\n      \"checksums\": [\n        {\n          \"algorithm\": \"SHA512\",\n          \"checksumValue\": \"bf690311ee7b95e713ba568322e3533f2dd1cb880b189e99d4edef13592b81764daec43e2c54c61d5c558dc5cfb35ecb85b65519e74026ff17675b6f8f916f4a\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Discussed in https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy/discussions/9082\n",

This means that we'll have an error raised and an information that the refresh failed. (It is not true, since we only failed to get the status of the job)\r\n- The task is retried, **which means we’re triggering another job on tableau**\r\n- The two triggered jobs create a resource conflict.\n\n### What you think should happen instead\n\nThere should be a retry strategy on poking (wait_for_status), where we at least try to fetch the started job 2 more times before failing the task execution. This is to avoid a resource conflict on Tableau's side, which will happen when we initiate a new refresh while the existing one didn't finish.\n\n### How to reproduce\n\nMock a 502 response from a server when executing poking for status.\r\nPlease find attached logs form 3 attempts of the same DAG run (failed when really the job on Tableau succeeded).\r\n[dag_id=daily_refresh_tableau_workbooks_run_id=scheduled__2023-07-06T03_30_00+00_00_task_id=refresh_workbook_main_transactions_dashboard_attempt=3.log](https://github.com/apache/airflow/files/12144604/dag_id.daily_refresh_tableau_workbooks_run_id.scheduled__2023-07-06T03_30_00%2B00_00_task_id.refresh_workbook_main_transactions_dashboard_attempt.3.log)\r\n[dag_id=daily_refresh_tableau_workbooks_run_id=scheduled__2023-07-06T03_30_00+00_00_task_id=refresh_workbook_main_transactions_dashboard_attempt=3 (2).log](https://github.com/apache/airflow/files/12144606/dag_id.daily_refresh_tableau_workbooks_run_id.scheduled__2023-07-06T03_30_00%2B00_00_task_id.refresh_workbook_main_transactions_dashboard_attempt.3.2.log)\r\n[dag_id=daily_refresh_tableau_workbooks_run_id=scheduled__2023-07-06T03_30_00+00_00_task_id=refresh_workbook_main_transactions_dashboard_attempt=3 (1).log](https://github.com/apache/airflow/files/12144607/dag_id.daily_refresh_tableau_workbooks_run_id.scheduled__2023-07-06T03_30_00%2B00_00_task_id.refresh_workbook_main_transactions_dashboard_attempt.3.1.log)\r\n\n\n### Operating System\n\ndebian booster (docker)\n\n### Versions of Apache Airflow Providers\n\npache-airflow-providers-tableau 2.1.8\n\n### Deployment\n\nOfficial Apache Airflow Helm Chart\n\n### Deployment details\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else\n\n_No response_\n\n### Are you willing to submit PR?\n\n- [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n",

Improper nesting can confuse assistive technology users and impair content discoverability.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. go to a tutorial page (e.g., /tutorials/get-started/).\n2. Locate each heading\n3. Inspect the sequence of heading levels and observe instances where the heading level jumps by more than one (e.g., `<h1>` directly to `<h6>`), indicating improper nesting.\n\nfor example:\n\n#### page 1\n1. Go to /tutorials/setting-up-your-environment/\n2. Locate to the following elements\nPosition 1: h6 element “By Layla Quiñones, Jaleesa Trapp“\n\n#### page 2\n1. Go to /tutorials/get-started/.\n2.  Locate to the following element:\n* Position 1: h4 element \"Default Code\" in Step 1 section\n \n#### page 3\n1. Go to /tutorials/variables-and-change/.\n2.

Go to /tutorials/organizing-code-with-functions/.\n2.  Locate to the following element:\n* Position 1: h6 element \"By Greg Benedis-Grab, Layla Quiñones\"\n* Position 2: h5 element \"Or Try This Spicy Challenge!\" in Conclusion section\n* Position 3: h1 element \"Next Steps\"\n* Position 4: h1 element \"References\"\n\n#### page 5\n1.

My plugin is loaded (I see my logs), but the [extendMarkdownPageData](vscode-file://vscode-app/usr/share/code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html) function is never called during the build, even though I have many markdown files in my [docs](vscode-file://vscode-app/usr/share/code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html) folder.\n\nHere’s a minimal version of my plugin:\n\n```\n// src/plugins/git-commit-info/index.js\nconst { exec } = require('child_process');\n\nfunction getLastCommitHashAsync(filePath) {\n  return new Promise((resolve) => {\n    exec(`git log -n 1 --pretty=format:%h -- \\\"${filePath}\\\"`, { encoding: 'utf8' }, (err, stdout) => {\n      if (err) return resolve(null);\n      resolve(stdout.trim());\n    });\n  });\n}\n\nconsole.log('[git-commit-info] Plugin loaded');\n\nmodule.exports = function (context, options) {\n  return {\n    name: 'docusaurus-plugin-git-commit-info',\n    async extendMarkdownPageData(mdData) {\n      console.log('[git-commit-info] mdData:', mdData);\n      // ...rest of logic...\n      return mdData;\n    },\n  };\n};\n```\n\nAnd in my docusaurus.config.js I add it like this:\n\n```\nplugins: [\n  require.resolve('./src/plugins/git-commit-info'),\n  // other plugins...\n],\n```\n\nBut the hook is never triggered.\n\nWhat I have tried so far:\n\nI confirmed that my plugin is being loaded by adding [console.log('[git-commit-info] Plugin loaded');] at the top level, and I see this message during the build.\nI added multiple [console.log]  statements inside the [extendMarkdownPageData] function to check if it is ever called and to inspect the [mdData] object.\nI verified that I have many markdown files in my [docs] directory, and they are referenced in my sidebar.\nI tried running the build with different Docusaurus versions.\nI also considered moving the plugin to remarkPlugins, but I understand this is not the correct approach for Docusaurus content plugins.\nDespite these steps, the extendMarkdownPageData function is never called during the build.\n\nMy questions:\nIs [extendMarkdownPageData](vscode-file://vscode-app/usr/share/code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html) only called for plugins loaded as part of the docs content pipeline (e.g., via docs.plugins in [docusaurus.config.js](vscode-file://vscode-app/usr/share/code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html)), and not for plugins in the main plugins array?\nShould I add my plugin to the docs.plugins array instead?\nIs there a recommended way to hook into the docs processing pipeline to add metadata to each doc page?\nIs there anything else I might be missing?\nThank you for your help!\n", "Thank you!

Do you have an example plan that provokes this that we can turn into a unit test for this?", "I tried to make a simplified plan to demonstrate the error, but without success. It appears randomly when I work with many devices controlled in multi-run plans. ", "Would you be able to post the full plan? It might give a clue as to where it fails...", "Well... I don't have a \"plan\" in the standard sense. I am working on software that provides a GUI for \"plan builder\" for running my experiment. \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/498da074-9fd5-45e4-90ca-0caf5061c4b0)\n\nIn general, it can be summarized to the plan like this:\n\n```\ndevices = [motor0, motor1, motor2, detector0,....]\nmonitor = [motor0, motor1, motor2,...]\nunmonitor_before_read = [motor2,motor1]\ndef plan():\n    yield from bps.open_run()\n    yield from bps.trigger_and_read(devices)\n    for motor in monitor:\n        yield from bps.monitor(motor, name=motor.name+\"_monitor\")\n\n    # >>> generated by \"plan builder\"\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            for m in unmonitor_before_read:\n                yield from bps.unmonitor(m)\n            yield from bps.trigger_and_read(devices)\n            for m in unmonitor_before_read:\n                yield from bps.monitor(m,name=m.name+\"_monitor\")\n    # << generated by \"plan builder\"\n    \n    yield from bps.close_run()\n```\nSo I start and interrupt the monitors depending on the inner plans. As I said before, the error appears randomly, so I can't reproduce it in the simplified plan. I do not exclude that \"plan builder\" generates code with errors, as this project is in its early stage.\nA simple copy of the `_listeners` dict solves the problem, so I decided to share it with the community...\n" ],

This issue occurs after enabling the practice tab and can be consistently reproduced.\n\n\n### URL of the page where the issue is observed.\n\nN/A\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Assign yourself the Curriculum Admin role.\n\n2. Generate:\n\n    - A dummy math classroom\n\n    - A dummy topic\n\n    - A dummy skill\n\n3. Add the dummy topic to the math classroom via http://localhost:8181/classroom-admin.\n\n4. In the Topic Editor, add the dummy skill to a subtopic.\n\n5. Check the \"Show practice tab to learners\" option.\n\n6. Go to the topic's page and open the Revision tab.\n\n7. Resize the browser window while on the Revision tab.\n\n8. Observe the formatting of the mat-card in the body.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe layout of the mat-card should adapt responsively and remain well-formatted, similar to how it behaves in the Learn page(http://localhost:8181/learn/math/dummy-topic-one/practice).\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/460c1fa2-e90d-4ab6-be00-4a2093723b55)\n\n### Screenshots/Videos\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d8ceab3-a026-41dc-b9f1-62023627e999)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f8229d5-d387-470c-812e-623ddba5a355)\n\n### What device are you using?\n\nDesktop, Mobile\n\n### Operating System\n\nMacOS\n\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Browser version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Tips for developers\n\nBefore addressing the bug, please identify which PR caused the issue (you can follow the steps [here](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/How-to-find-the-commit-which-introduced-a-bug)). If you identify the PR, comment on the issue with a link to it. If not, mention the commit hash of the oldest commit you saw the bug on (and the month and year it was made in).\n\nThen, please leave a comment with details of the approach that you plan to take to fix the issue (see [example](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/issues/19157#issuecomment-1858788463)).\n\n**Note:** If this is your first Oppia issue, please make sure to follow our guidelines for [choosing an issue](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Contributing-code-to-Oppia#choosing-a-good-first-issue) and [setting things up](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Contributing-code-to-Oppia#setting-things-up).

Instead of doing this manually, it would be nice to have a function that automatically prefix the message with the corresponding device name. Or in the case of a PCI device, it might be nice to also add the PCI address etc.\r\n\r\nA example API could be: `dmesgln_device(device, \"Example message: {}\", \"Hello Friends!\"sv);` Or it could take a `File` instead, which is the base class of the `Kernel::Device`.\r\n\r\nSame places where this could be used:\r\nhttps://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/blob/8b0a464f5c281456a2f382e7296b1c92cedc2c8a/Kernel/Net/Realtek/RTL8139NetworkAdapter.cpp#L139\r\nhttps://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/blob/8b0a464f5c281456a2f382e7296b1c92cedc2c8a/Kernel/Storage/ATA/AHCI/Port.cpp#L186\r\n\r\nGrepping for `dmesgln(\"` will show many more examples of where such an API could be used.\r\n",

      "description" : "Currently when a user presses enter, the profile page at the top of the results list is what loads. However, consider how Google treats this (screenshot below).\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17221652/118880440-dc58bf00-b8bf-11eb-8d7f-20e752a01733.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17221652/118880777-41141980-b8c0-11eb-8b0c-4b5eca9ee53a.png)\r\n\r\nI am not suggesting that we use auto-complete (though that is certainly an interesting idea) but notice that in this instance if one was to press \"enter\" Google would not bring you to search results for \"gordon college bennett center\" but rather what I typed - \"gordon college.\" This contrasts to our quick Header People Search, which just assumes you meant the top result if you press enter (which is more like the first screenshot).\r\n\r\nWhat if instead, pressing enter takes you to People Search with pre-filled in entries _based on_ the top result. For example, entering \"Cam\" into the Header People Search like this first image would lead to the page in the second image because the top result matched using first name.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17221652/118881598-46be2f00-b8c1-11eb-9822-a53ce80209e6.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17221652/118881657-50e02d80-b8c1-11eb-8db3-8d3efa947181.png)\r\n\r\nHowever, if \"Campo\" is typed, the top result is based on the last name \"Campoli\" so it should lead to the appropriate page.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17221652/118882034-b6341e80-b8c1-11eb-80d4-a861c3e2549c.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17221652/118882191-e8de1700-b8c1-11eb-97a9-c9fafe73e9ae.png)\r\n\r\nFor the use case that a first _and_ last name is entered in some fashion, intuitively both these sections would be filled. So if one enters \"Cam A\" the People Search results for first name \"Cam\" and last name \"A\" should appear.\r\n\r\nAs another use case, perhaps if there is only one result for a given search criterium, we can go straight to that particular profile like we are currently with all search results. That may be debatably less consistent, but a good practical idea to consider.\r\n",

      "comments" : [ "I wonder if it would be beneficial to modify the people search page to have a generic search bar that runs off of similar functionality to the quick people search bar. Then, you could have an \"advanced search\" button that would switch the view to our existing people search page (with all of the more specific fields & filters). This would be more like traditional search pages as it still allows for the basic search with a results page.\r\n\r\nOnce we did that, we would be able to pass a generic query parameter (like \"Cam\" in this case) and it would bring up all of the results that you would have seen in the quick search bar previously. I think that makes the most UX sense, but I welcome input from @EjPlatzer @ChrisImagineer .", "I'm not sure I see the use case for having the People Search page duplicate the functionality of the quick search bar. Given that the quick search bar is visible from every page (as long as you're authenticated), no one would ever need to use the People Search page for the \"non-advanced\" search features - they can simply use the search bar.\r\n\r\nGiven that, it seems like the only reason to have the simple search is to make it easier for us as developers to pass search values from the search bar to the people search page. Assuming that's something we want to do (which I'm not convinced it is), we shouldn't default to this implementation just because it's the easiest.\r\n\r\nConsider, for example, why someone would want to go from the search bar to the People Search page: they weren't able to find what they were looking for from the search bar. If I couldn't find what I wanted to in the search bar, and then was re-directed to a page that displayed the exact same search bar with the exact same results, I would be a mixture of frustrated and disappointed.\r\n\r\nI think instead, if we did want to redirect to the People Search page automatically, we should show the current search page and populate the fields with the person's search bar query. That would mean naively putting their search into the first name field if they only put one word in, but that's still better than showing them a bigger version of the same thing they were just looking at.\r\n\r\nFor the record, I don't think hitting enter in the search bar should redirect someone to the People Search page. Instead, we should adjust the highlighting so that the first element in the results is highlighted by default:\r\n<img width=\"288\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35319956/166314896-2df85ce4-df1e-44d2-89b4-e2bb642c31a0.png\">\r\nThis way it's more clear to the user what will happen if they hit enter.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we could include a \"advanced search\" link at the bottom of the search bar results list that redirects to the People Search page (possibly pre-filled with their search bar query). So when someone scrolls through all the search bar results without finding what they were looking for they can go straight to advanced search. That seems like a more natural and fluid set of use cases in my opinion.", "I agree with Evan.  We should highlight the top entry by default to make the current behavior clearer.  Already, using up/down arrows highlights the other entries, and \"enter\" goes to the page for the selected user.  So the only flaw is not starting with the top item highlighted. " ],

This violates the HTML specification and can lead to inconsistent rendering across browsers as well as difficulties for assistive technologies to interpret the list structure correctly.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Go to /reference/p5/arc/\n2.  Locate to the following element:\n#main-content > div.md\\:mx-lg.mt-md.mx-5 > div:nth-child(2) > section > ul\n(This issue is since to be a global issue)\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe `<ul>` element contains elements other than `<li>`, `<script>`, or `<template>` as direct children.\nThe `<ul>` element includes disallowed direct children (e.g., `<div>`, `<p>`, etc.) rather than wrapping all content within `<li>`, `<script>`, or `<template>` elements.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nEnsure all ordered (`<ol>`) and unordered (`<ul>`) list elements only have the following elements as direct children:\n- `<li>`\n- `<script>`\n- `<template>`\nAny other elements should be wrapped appropriately within `<li>` elements.\n\n### Environments\n\n_No response_\n\n### Suggested Fix\n\nRefactor the markup so that all direct children of `<ul>` or `<ol>` that are not `<li>`, `<script>`, `<template>` elements are wrapped within `<li>` elements. For example:\n```html\n<ul class=\"content-grid-simple\">\n  <li><div>Content</div></li>\n</ul>\n```\n\n### Reference\n\nWCAG:\n- [1.3.1 - Info and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#info-and-relationships)\n\nWCAG-T:\n- [H48: Using ol, ul and dl for lists or groups of links](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/html/H48)\n- [F43: Failure of Success Criterion 1.3.1 due to using structural markup in a way that does not represent relationships in the content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/failures/F43)\n\nother:\n- [ARIA: list role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/list_role)\n- [ARIA: listitem role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/listitem_role)\n\n### What is your operating system?\n\nNone\n\n### Web browser and version\n\n_No response_",

Backend Adjustments (`services/supabase`)\n- Refactor all code references to `owner_id` across query logic, types, and service utilities.\n- Ensure all affected endpoints and mutations behave as expected with the updated schema.\n\n### 3. Frontend Integration (`apps/web`)\n- Update Supabase queries, types, and hooks that reference `owner_id`.\n- Refactor relevant components or forms handling project ownership or user metadata.\n- Run and update any impacted unit tests or mocks accordingly.\n\n### 4. Documentation\n- Update schema diagrams, ERD references, and technical documentation under `docs/` to reflect the updated field naming and align with project terminology.\n\n###  Deliverables\n- Fully working PR with schema + code changes.\n- A Supabase CLI-compatible SQL migration script.\n- Clear changelog and commit breakdown.\n- Optional: Schema diff or notes for internal dev reference.\n\n**ETA:** I estimate 36–48 hours for full implementation, testing, and documentation updates.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to take it! \nHappy to help standardize and improve the DB structure.\n", "# Hi there, @4c1d-V \uD83D\uDC4B You've been assigned this issue.\n\nOne invite is waiting for you in your email.

However, its usefulness is quite limited, as there is still no obvious way to use them in forms, because they do not implement `AsFormField`.\n\nFor `Weekday`, we implement `AsFormField` manually:\n\nhttps://github.com/cot-rs/cot/blob/144a377acb646852cbdf8a4b2c174b130003ecef/cot/src/form/fields/chrono.rs#L8-L54\n\nFor user-defined enums, I think there are two possible ways to tackle this:\n\n1. Add a derive macro that would create generic `AsFormField` `impl`s for the enum as well as `Vec<T>`, `HashSet<T>`, etc., similarly to the ones for `Weekday`.\n2. Add wrapper structs (e.g. `Choice` and `ChoiceMultiple`) that would contain the enum implementing SelectChoice, and a `Vec` of these, respectively.\n\nWhich of these would be more appropriate is subject to discussion.

      "description" : "**Describe the problem**\n\nEdit 4/11/2025:\n\nThis issue should be scoped to just updating how we're defining the default value of the aria-label on Spinner. Ideally we want the default value to be rendered in the props table, rather than rendering as though there isn't any default value currently.\n\n\nOriginal comment:\n\nThe `Spinner` component hardcodes `aria-label` attribute when neither `aria-label` nor `aria-labelledby` is provided.\n\nhttps://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/blob/3ba79b0c6c6e750996f6134251dc6c6bd5eeb28a/packages/react-core/src/components/Spinner/Spinner.tsx#L47\n\n**How do you reproduce the problem?**\n\nMount a `Spinner` without providing an `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`.\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nA spinner without a hardcoded English value. The component should allow consumers to use it without `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`. It might be just a complementary visual hint hidden from the a11y tree using `aria-hidden` when rendered alongside relevant text.\n\n**Is this issue blocking you?**\n\nSomehow. A workaround exists by setting `aria-labelledby`, but it would be preferable if, as said above, the spinner could be used as a visual hint for sighted users while being excluded from the a11y tree.\n\n**Screenshots**\n\nN/A\n\n**What is your environment?**\n\nN/A\n\n**What is your product and what release date are you targeting?**\n\nN/A\n\n**Any other information?**\n\n- The [Spinner props documentation](https://www.patternfly.org/components/spinner#spinner) does not mention a default value for `aria-label`.\n- This behavior was introduced in commit 09733cb4f0fc5cd67f5df284 as part of https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/pull/6730, but I was not able to find the reasoning there.\n- `aria-valuetext` also has a hardcoded default value, even when it may not be applicable.\n\n  > `aria-valuetext` is only needed when the numeric value of `aria-valuenow` is not meaningful.  \n  >\n  > [MDN Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-valuetext)\n",

      "comments" : [ "I'd probably reconsider whether it should be hidden from the accessibility tree, even if there's other text close to the Spinner that conveys some sort of loading state. Main reason being is that the spinner will convey that the loading progress is \"indeterminate\", which surrounding text may or may not do.

My fault! I completely overlooked the `progressbar` role that the Spinner SVG is using! That’s why I wasn’t fully understanding the decision of going for these default values.\n\nRegarding having both the `aria-label` and the static text, I thought it might be redundant and possibly annoying for screen reader users, especially if both contain the same message. In any case, now that I have a better understanding, I’ll rework my use of the Spinner to include only one descriptive text. Either by using `aria-labelledby` or by adding `aria-hidden` to the static text if it doesn’t provide any additional value.\n\n> That I think makes sense since just the aria-valuenow content (be it \"Loading\" or something similar) doesn't provide great context (what exactly is loading?).\n\nFully agree. \"Loading\" alone lacks the necessary context.\n\n> \n> Though I might strongly recommend against it, if `aria-hidden` is being passed to a Spinner, that should somewhat resolve the issue of having a default aria-label applied. While the aria-label will still be there, the Spinner won't be in the a11y tree.\n> \n\nNo doubts, I’ve got a long road ahead on my accessibility learning journey, as this issue has proven. That said, in my tests, when `aria-hidden` is applied, the entire Spinner is removed from the accessibility tree, including its `aria-label` (checked with Chrome and Firefox developer tools) .\n\n> I do think we can tweak the Spinner code so that the default value of aria-label is rendered in the props table, though.\n\nAgain, thank you for your enlightening explanation and please excuse me for reporting this as an issue when it clearly wasn’t one \uD83D\uDE4F ", "It's better to raise an issue that may turn out to be intended behavior than have something sneak by us, so absolutely no worries opening this! We don't know what we don't know and all, and whether it leads to us fixing/adding something to improve the user experience or just a good discussion, it's worth it.\n\nI'll edit your original comment just to note what this issue should go towards resolving (updating how we're defining the default value). If you'd be interested in working on it just let me know and I can assign you (no pressure to, though), otherwise I can put a \"good first issue\" label for others to pick it up.", "> If you'd be interested in working on it just let me know and I can assign you (no pressure to, though), otherwise I can put a \"good first issue\" label for others to pick it up.\n\nI fear I'm a bit busy these days \uD83D\uDE22 for investing the time it needs to be not only changed but also properly tested. So, I'd label it as good first issue and give others a chance to work on it.\n\nThat said, just in case could be useful for others, as far as I could check, https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-org is relying on https://github.com/reactjs/react-docgen for generating the [PropsTable](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-org/blob/main/packages/documentation-framework/components/propsTable/propsTable.js#L18). Thus, I guess it could be as simple as moving the default value to the props initialization as shown in below diff\n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/packages/react-core/src/components/Spinner/Spinner.tsx b/packages/react-core/src/components/Spinner/Spinner.tsx\nindex 77e599773..4099da094 100644\n--- a/packages/react-core/src/components/Spinner/Spinner.tsx\n+++ b/packages/react-core/src/components/Spinner/Spinner.tsx\n@@ -32,7 +32,7 @@ export const Spinner: React.FunctionComponent<SpinnerProps> = ({\n   'aria-valuetext': ariaValueText = 'Loading...',\n   diameter,\n   isInline = false,\n-  'aria-label': ariaLabel,\n+  'aria-label': ariaLabel = 'Contents',\n   'aria-labelledBy': ariaLabelledBy,\n   ...props\n }: SpinnerProps) => (\n@@ -42,9 +42,7 @@ export const Spinner: React.FunctionComponent<SpinnerProps> = ({\n     aria-valuetext={ariaValueText}\n     viewBox=\"0 0 100 100\"\n     {...(diameter && { style: { [cssDiameter.name]: diameter } as React.CSSProperties })}\n-    {...(ariaLabel && { 'aria-label': ariaLabel })}\n-    {...(ariaLabelledBy && { 'aria-labelledBy': ariaLabelledBy })}\n-    {...(!ariaLabel && !ariaLabelledBy && { 'aria-label': 'Contents' })}\n+    {...(ariaLabelledBy ? { 'aria-labelledBy': ariaLabelledBy } : { 'aria-label': ariaLabel })}\n     {...props}\n   >\n     <circle className={styles.spinnerPath} cx=\"50\" cy=\"50\" r=\"45\" fill=\"none\" />\n```\n\nHowever, this approach puts the component at risk of having neither `aria-label` nor `aria-labelledby` if the consumer passes an empty string for the former and omits the latter. While this is technically a misuse, I'm not sure if it's something you want to guard against or leave up to the consumer.", "Yep exactly what I was thinking!

      "description" : "## TLDR\n\nIn expressions, `foo/bar` bad, `./foo/bar` good\n\n## Is your feature request related to a problem?\n\nMost path literal expressions start with `./` in practice. (if not `../`)\nThis is a good practice because it makes it clear from the start what's the role of the text that follows.\n\nIn fact the use of path literal expressions like `foo/bar.nix` is sufficiently rare that experienced Nixers are unaware of this possibility (https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/413892)\n\nPerhaps the time has come to take this convention.\n\n## Proposed solution\n\n1. Add a setting to warn or fail when a relative path is encountered that does not start with a `.`\n2. After some time, default the setting to warn by default\n\nI'd stop there, so that we can keep evaluating old expressions without significant intervention.\nOpting out of an error may be hard when multiple hosts are involved in a deployment process that involves evaluation.\n\n## Alternative solutions\n\n**Linting**. This is far less effective. We want everyone to stop using this syntax, not just those who have the knowledge and headspace for it, and we want good coverage; not just the projects that have integrated tooling.\n\n## Additional context\n\n- Similar to https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/8738\n\n- A language redesign could parse `./foo/bar` as syntax sugar for `${.}/foo/bar` or `(.)/foo` or something. We can't do that because we want to stay compatible, and that involves parsing things like `foo/bar` directly as a path literal anyway.\n\n## Checklist\n\n<!-- make sure this issue is not redundant or obsolete -->\n\n- [ ] checked [latest Nix manual] \\([source])\n- [ ] checked [open feature issues and pull requests] for possible duplicates\n\n[latest Nix manual]: https://nixos.org/manual/nix/unstable/\n[source]: https://github.com/NixOS/nix/tree/master/doc/manual/source\n[open feature issues and pull requests]: https://github.com/NixOS/nix/labels/feature\n\n---\n\nAdd :+1: to [issues you find important](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc).\n",
