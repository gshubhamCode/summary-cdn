The current SDK  uses uppercase and hyphens in the header names, which leads to this metadata validation error.\n\nTo fix it we need to change \n\n### 1. In client.py\n\n```python\n# gRPC authentication headers (from Go SDK)\nHEADER_CALLER_ID = \"ONLINE-FEATURE-STORE-CALLER-ID\"\nHEADER_CALLER_TOKEN = \"ONLINE-FEATURE-STORE-AUTH-TOKEN\"\n```\n\nto \n\n```python\n# gRPC authentication headers (from Go SDK)\nHEADER_CALLER_ID = \"online_feature_store_caller_id\"\nHEADER_CALLER_TOKEN = \"online_feature_store_auth_token\"\n```\n\n### 2. On server side on middle-ware we need to handle accordingly for extracting and authenticating headers\n```go\nonst (\n\tAuthToken       = \"AUTH_TOKEN\"\n\tcallerIdHeader  = \"online-feature-store-caller-id\"\n\tAuthTokenHeader = \"online-feature-store-auth-token\"\n)\n\nfunc ServerInterceptor(ctx context.Context, req any, info *grpc.UnaryServerInfo, handler grpc.UnaryHandler) (resp any, err error) {\n\tstartTime := time.Now()\n\tmd, ok := metadata.FromIncomingContext(ctx)\n\tif !ok {\n\t\treturn nil, status.Errorf(codes.InvalidArgument, \"mandatory metadata are missing\")\n\t}\n\tcallerId, ok := md[callerIdHeader]\n\tif !ok {\n\t\treturn nil, status.Errorf(codes.InvalidArgument, \"%s header is missing\", callerIdHeader)\n\t}\n\tauthHeader, ok := md[AuthTokenHeader]\n\tif !ok {\n\t\treturn nil, status.Errorf(codes.InvalidArgument, \"%s header is missing\", AuthTokenHeader)\n\t}\n```\n\nFor backward compatibility with go client we need to assume\n\n```go\ncallerIdHeader  as \"online-feature-store-caller-id\" | \"online_feature_store_caller_id\"\nAuthTokenHeader as \"online-feature-store-auth-token\" | \"online_feature_store_auth_token\"\n```\n", "@AryAgarwal  if you???re interested, feel free to raise a PR with the fix, it should mostly involve replacing the header keys options. We???ll be happy to review and help if needed!\nIf you???d rather not patch it yourself, let us know, we can take care of it immediately." ],

I may be able to implement this if I have a valid JSON example from the endpoint (it's not available via the python-garminconnect directly, but we can always make the request with `garmin_obj.connectapi(endpoint)` )\n\nI am marking this as good first issue for other people to have a look. The goal is to figure out the endpoint for temperature tracking and writing a function to extract this and add it under the sleep measurement on influxDB so it can be visualized alongside.

Write a brief description of how you will approach the task (without using ChatGPT).\n3. Add your Telegram handler in your application (e.g., in OnlyDust or similar)\n4. Write ETA in your application\n\n\n\n## What should I do if I have a problem\n1. Try to google it before asking. Googling is taking major part of dev work \n2. If you couldn't find answer your question with Google, text your question to [dev](https://t.me/spotnet_dev/4) group with your question.\n3. Do not send DM to maintainer, it would be better and faster to ask other contributors in chat \n\n\n## How to prepare PR\n1. Check if your code [smell](https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/smells) good\n2. Add `close #<issue number>` to link your issue with your PR\n3. Do not commit changes that are unrelated to your task\n4. Check after you created PR, if you committed everything\n\n\n## Task Description\n1. In the [filters folder](./blob/main/margin/margin_app/app/telegram/filters), create a new admin filter that checks the user ID against `ADMIN_IDS` from the settings. If it matches, return `True`.\n2. Create a new handler in [this folder](./blob/main/margin/margin_app/app/telegram/handlers), for example `/admin_check`, that replies with a message like `You are an admin!` or `You aren???t an admin!`, or a similar message conveying the same meaning.\n",

      "description" : "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Problem description\n\nWhat is missing (and is available in most CAD software) is to align the camera view to a selected reference in the 3D view, with a dedicated button in the core toolbar.\n\nIn the sketcher there is a button to align the 3D view to the plane of the sketch, so why not allow this as a core function in FreeCAD. It would be helpful in many WB, to make splits in Curves WB (always from the viewing angle), activate clipping planes, ...\n\nThere is a macro for this I have found in the Addon Manager \"Align View to Face\" https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Macro_Align_View_to_Face which works good for faces and datums but I have to install it on every machine and create a custom button for it. Would this be a start to merge this function and eventually update its features?\n\nThe align view to reference tool should align the camera to the previous selection:\n\n- Faces and Datums > Normal view (like the macro does today)\n- If the camera view already matches the selection, maybe reverse it to view from behind (- normal direction) or a button (even in dropdown menu of the new button) to reverse it.\n- Allow the selection of edges, lines and axes and set their direction to the normal position of the camera view\n- Allow the view to be aligned to current clipping planes\n- Replace ViewSketch with the new tool and set it to the active sketch plane https://wiki.freecad.org/Sketcher_ViewSketch\n- Maybe run a \"FitSelection\" command after setting the view rotation to get the whole selection in focus\n\n---\n\n- [x] One Face\n- [x] One Line\n- [x] Datums (axis/plane)\n- [x] Origin objects (axis system and default planes for bodies and part objects)\n- [x] If one line is a curve or circle and laying in one dimension / plane --> use this normal direction\n- [ ] If the camera view already matches the selection, maybe reverse it to view from behind (- normal direction) or a button (even in dropdown menu of the new button) to reverse it.\n- [ ] Multiple faces (average direction)\n- [ ] Average normal of curved surfaces\n- [ ] Multiple lines (if they lay on one common plane (always with selection of 2 straight lines), align to this plane's normal)\n- [ ] Allow the view to be aligned to current clipping planes\n- [ ] Replace ViewSketch with the new tool and set it to the active sketch plane https://wiki.freecad.org/Sketcher_ViewSketch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Full version info\n\n```shell\nOS: Windows 11 build 22621\nWord size of FreeCAD: 64-bit\nVersion: 0.22.0dev.34810 (Git)\nBuild type: Release\nBranch: main\nHash: 196cbecde66a1c3a1b56b8c532ad1faedff4818b\nPython 3.10.13, Qt 5.15.8, Coin 4.0.0, Vtk 9.2.5, OCC 7.6.3\nLocale: German/Germany (de_DE)\nInstalled mods: \n  * 3DfindIT 1.2.0\n  * 3D_Printing_Tools\n  * BIM 2021.12.0\n  * CfdOF 1.24.7\n  * CurvedShapes 1.0.4\n  * Curves 0.6.14\n  * Defeaturing 1.2.1\n  * fasteners 0.4.68\n  * freecad.gears 1.0.0\n  * freecad_metal_workbench 0.0.1\n  * OpenDark 2023.10.30\n  * sheetmetal 0.3.1\n  * Silk 0.1.5\n```\n\n\n\n### Subproject(s) affected?\n\nNone\n\n### Anything else?\n\nhttps://wiki.freecadweb.org/Macro_Align_View_to_Face\nhttps://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=58695\nhttps://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=76717\nhttps://wiki.freecad.org/Macro_Align_Face_Object_to_View\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct",

It's probably easier to go deeper to fix it rather than write from scratch I guess.\r\n\r\nElse you need to handle all the cases.

For now I am working on this:\n\n> If the camera view already matches the selection, maybe reverse it to view from behind (- normal direction) or a button (even in dropdown menu of the new button) to reverse it.\n\nI added a parameter to align to the reverse direction. It won't reverse if the camera view matches the selection because that could be confusing sometimes, better be explicit about this.

Could you also make the icon for the reverse align to selection please?\n", "@Rexbas thanks. I would help if I would know something. Which one would be the easiest of the missing ones?\nNot sure if we should do a separate command to have negative view. Workaround could always be: align to normal and the circle on the navi cube can flip the view. That I thought could the AlignToSelection do on a second click.\n\nWhen looking at the PR: not covered would be if I select 2 straight edges which would always be in one common plane (if they are not coincident)?", "Theses are probably the harder ones, currently the alignment code only considers one selection. So two edges are not yet considered.\n - [ ] Multiple faces (average direction)\n - [ ] Average normal of curved surfaces\n - [ ] Multiple lines (if they lay on one common plane (always with selection of 2 straight lines), align to this plane's normal)\n\n\n> That I thought could the AlignToSelection do on a second click.\n\nI tried this, it is possible but also a bit confusing. Sometimes I want to click on something and make sure I am aligned. But if I already am aligned then it goes to the opposite view which is a bit annoying. I am more a proponent of having a button that explicitly sets alignment form the front and one that explicitly sets alignment reversed. Maybe the @FreeCAD/design-working-group should weigh in about what would be better?\n\nI have two branches with the different implementations:\nhttps://github.com/Rexbas/FreeCAD/tree/reverse-align-selection\nhttps://github.com/Rexbas/FreeCAD/tree/auto-reverse-align\n\nCurrently having a quick look to see if I can replace ViewSketch with the new tool.\n" ],

TypeScript Compatibility: The project tests are written in TypeScript, since node:test doesn???t support TypeScript by default, I???ve been exploring options. I???ve found that tsx and ts-node can run TypeScript tests without precompiling, which is helpful. I???m also looking into test loaders but still need to test this setup.\n2. Test Reporting: Right now, the project uses tap-mocha-reporter, and I saw that node:test has a built-in JUnit reporter. I???m not sure how well it will work with TypeScript tests, so I may need to experiment to figure that out.\n3. Considering borp: I found a test runner called borp, which works with TypeScript and uses node:test. It seems like a good option since it also handles coverage with c8 and provides reporting tools. I???m wondering if switching to it might make things easier overall.\n\nI???d appreciate any thoughts you have on the best way to handle this, especially around TypeScript support and reporting.\n\nThanks!", "I actually `borp` for that specific reason.

We don't account for the case when that translation does not exist for some reason, so instead of gracefully sending a response without the title or with a placeholder, instead the request is aborted with status code 500, not delivering any useful information.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Go to https://cms-test.integreat-app.de/api/v3/maintal/de/events/?combine_recurring=True\n2. See error\n\n### Expected Behavior\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen. -->\nGraceful failure: Even if we cannot deliver the title of the location in the regions default language, we should deliver everything else of the response. The location title could fall back to a non-truthy value like `null`, be an empty string or a placeholder value\n\n### Actual Behavior\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what actually happened. -->\nThe whole request *(in this case about multiple upcoming events)* is aborted with an *Internal Server Error*\n\n### Additional Information\n<!-- Add any other context (e.g. logs, etc.) about the problem here. -->\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Traceback</summary>\n\n```\nJul 06 09:00:24 ERROR   django.request - 500 Internal Server Error: /api/v3/maintal/de/events/?combine_recurring=True\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/opt/integreat-cms/.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/django/core/handlers/exception.py\", line 55, in inner\n    response = get_response(request)\n               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"/opt/integreat-cms/.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/django/core/handlers/base.py\", line 197, in _get_response\n    response = wrapped_callback(request, *callback_args, **callback_kwargs)\n               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"/opt/integreat-cms/.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/integreat_cms/api/decorators.py\", line 125, in wrap\n    return function(request, *args, **kwargs)\n           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"/opt/integreat-cms/.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/integreat_cms/api/v3/events.py\", line 225, in events\n    transform_event_translation(event_translation, poi_translation),\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"/opt/integreat-cms/.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/integreat_cms/api/v3/events.py\", line 99, in transform_event_translation\n    \"location\": transform_poi(event.location),\n                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"/opt/integreat-cms/.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/integreat_cms/api/v3/locations.py\", line 52, in transform_poi\n    \"name\": poi.default_public_translation.title,\n            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nAttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'title'\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### Related Issues\n<!-- A collection of all issues that are related to this issue and could be useful. -->\n<!-- Please also include the related integreat-app issues, if possible. -->\n\n\n\n### Summary of discussion and updates to the description\n<!-- Summarize the discussion if a long conversation was made that changed something.

This would allow users to zoom in for detailed inspection while maintaining the ability to see the full overview.\n\n```\n// Enhanced zoom with node scaling\nconst getScaledNodeStyle = (zoomLevel: number) => {\n  const scaleFactor = Math.max(0.5, Math.min(2.0, zoomLevel));\n  return {\n    padding: `${2 * scaleFactor}px ${12 * scaleFactor}px`,\n    fontSize: `${6 * scaleFactor}px`,\n    width: `${146 * scaleFactor}px`,\n    height: `${30 * scaleFactor}px`,\n  };\n};\n\n// Quick zoom presets\nconst zoomPresets = [\n  { level: 0.5, label: 'Overview' },\n  { level: 1.0, label: 'Standard' }, \n  { level: 1.5, label: 'Detailed' },\n  { level: 2.0, label: 'Focus' }\n];\n```\n\nThis is insure that the existing `ReactFlow` zoom infrastructure while making individual nodes more readable at higher zoom levels.", "Sounds interesting.

      "comments" : [ "Hello and thank you for this issue! The core team regularly reviews new issues and discusses them, but this can take a little time. Please bear with us while we get to your issue. If you're interested, the contribution guide has a section about the [decision-making process](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#who-decides-if-a-feature-will-be-implemented-and-how-is-that-decision-made).", "Thanks for reporting this, @mikeg-de!\n\nThese appear to be the temporary locations where OpenTofu downloads a provider package archive before extracting it into the provider cache directory.\n\nThere _is_ some code that makes a best-effort to clean these up:\n\nhttps://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/blob/f8d128491c43e7b246d9de8538e21b383722beba/internal/getproviders/package_location_http_archive.go#L82-L87\n\nHowever, I notice you are using Windows and so I suspect that what you've observed might be caused by Windows preventing the file from being deleted while it's still open, whereas that is allowed on other platforms that OpenTofu supports.\n\nDue to how `defer` works in Go, these `defer` calls will be visited in _reverse order_ when the function exits, which means that OpenTofu is effectively calling `os.Remove` before it calls `os.Close`. Inverting these so that the `os.Close` call happens before the `os.Remove` call might be sufficient to make this work on Windows, if my theory is correct.\n\nThere's some similar treatment in the newly-added `PackageOCIBlobArchive` which seems like it'll have the same problem but for a slightly different reason:\n\nhttps://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/blob/f8d128491c43e7b246d9de8538e21b383722beba/internal/getproviders/package_location_oci_blob_archive.go#L138-L142\n\nIn this case there is _only_ a call to `os.Remove`, and the function is relying on the automatic cleanup that closes the underlying filehandle when an `os.File` object goes out of scope, which would therefore _also_ cause these steps to happen in the wrong order. If I was correct about the cause of the problem in `PackageHTTPURL` then we should update `PackageOCIBlobArchive` to follow the same pattern.\n\nIn the meantime: OpenTofu does not rely on these files after provider installation is complete, so you can manually delete them immediately if you need to reclaim that disk space.\n", "We are also skipping checking the return values of both of those functions, which is not ideal.  We should at least be logging the error to help diagnose issues like this one.", "can I work on this?", "Sure!  Thanks @KrishnaSindhur!\n\nPlease take a look through the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) before getting started.", "Hi,\n\nIt seems this issue has been inactive for a few weeks.\nWould it be okay if I go ahead and work on it, or is someone already actively handling it?\n\nThanks in advance!" ],

Native/very fluent speakers only.\n\n??? **Read your email!**  Please make sure you have your Github notifications sent somewhere you will see them.  Most PRs need at least one round of adjustment before merging.  \n\n\uD83C\uDD95 New Github users are welcome!  When you submit your PR, please make sure that the \"files changed\" tab shows only the changes you intended to make.  If you have questions, please leave a comment and I'll try to help get you sorted out. \n\n\uD83D\uDC4B **Formality**: Ghost's brand has a friendly and fairly informal tone.  If your language has both formal and informal form, choose one or the other and use it consistently.  Most languages are using the informal version, but if the informal version might be considered rude, then choose the formal.\n\n\uD83E\uDD17  All kinds of people use Ghost.  When possible, prefer gender-neutral language.\n\n\uD83D\uDC4D Translations should work for a variety of Ghost sites.  Choose translations that will make sense for both personal blogs/newsletters and news publications.  \n\n\uD83D\uDC49 Please @ cathysarisky if you add a language PR.  Thanks!\n\n### Common issues to avoid & other notes:\n- Please give your PR a descriptive title that includes the language you are working on.\n- Check before starting that there isn't another PR for the same language.  If there is, please review it rather than duplicating work.\n- Consult the [context.json](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/main/ghost/i18n/locales/context.json) file if you aren't sure how a string will be used.  \n- We use *\"Jamie Larson\"* for a placeholder in any field that needs a name.  Please do not transliterate.  Please do not replace with \"Name\".  Instead, choose a name that will be recognized as a name in your language.  Choose something uncontroversial and common.

Variables, surrounded by { } (always a single set, not doubles) should match in the key (left side) and value (right side). They should never translated.  New variables should *never* be added to the right side, as they will not be correctly substituted.  If a variable is not present on the right side, one should generally suspect an error, although a few may be deliberate.\n\nIf your language has any \"Invalid Variables\" listed above, these need to be corrected.  Your strings will not display correctly.  If your theme has \"Missing variables\", these might or might not be intentional.  You can edit the error tracking file below to update anything intentional to explain your choice.\n\nErrors are tracked in [ghost/i18n/test/i18n-ignores.json](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/main/ghost/i18n/test/i18n-ignores.json) .  If you correct an error, you can also delete the override.\n\n\n\n",

For Babel upgrades, [refer to this comment](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/pull/13802#issuecomment-2996187240). They are difficult to handle and need extensive verification from us. Some of the others may need work but are easier for us to verify, I believe.\n\nAs a side note, here???s why we avoid frequent dependency upgrades. Upgrading is more than bumping version numbers: minor or major updates can introduce breaking changes and silent errors that are not covered by our tests. Our tests may catch some issues but miss others, leaving problems for future releases. Larger version jumps increase risk. We've seen this in past upgrades. Dependency updates are routine maintenance, which we've done a lot in recent years. Since we???re now focused on modernization and new features, I prefer to avoid introducing new issues unless they cause proven harm or come via contributions. We can handle quick fixes, but using core team capacity for routine updates would delay the long-requested features that Meteor desperately needs.\n\nOn security, I'm not concerned about dev-tools upgrades. Runtime dependencies for Meteor apps pose the real risk, so Meteor package patches should come first. Dev-tool vulnerabilities rarely affect development machines. I???d rather keep the Meteor tool stable as we modernize than chase time-consuming updates with no visible benefit. [I updated some in a separate branch](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/compare/devel...DEBT-update-tools-dependencies) to check performance with `meteor profile`, but saw no benefit and prefered to avoid any side-effect for this moment.\n\nAfter we complete Meteor???s [next major and most exciting roadmap milestones](https://docs.meteor.com/about/roadmap), which are our current focus, we can dedicate more effort to this kind of maintenance ourselves. I???ll discuss this with the team. We may add a dev-tool maintenance item to the roadmap.\n\nThat said, I encourage contributors to work on these upgrades in separate PRs, referring to the relevant upgrade changelogs and ensuring full migration and delivery, including addresing reviews, test coverage, and other guidence. We can support them and, based on each change set???s criticality, map out the steps needed for complete verification to be candidate for next releases.", "can i work on this issue if you want someone to do this" ],

I need some guidance to get started.", "Hello @singh1203, \uD83D\uDC4B \nThank you for taking ownership of this task.\n\nTo enable LWS support within the KAI Scheduler, you will be implementing a new PodGrouper plugin. This component is responsible for abstracting various workload types into PodGroups prior to scheduling.\n\nThe initial implementation steps are as follows:\n1. Develop a new PodGrouper plugin that inspects the LWS instance and generates PodGroupMetadata:\n    a. minAvailable should likely be derived from the leaderWorkerTemplate.\n    b. The podGroup owner should probably be the leader pod.\n    c. Set the default priority class to inference.\n    For reference, you may review the AzureML plugin implementation: [AzureML Plugin Example](https://github.com/NVIDIA/KAI-Scheduler/blob/bac4866ab5bba39cc76e900ced0c1da31339a4a1/pkg/podgrouper/podgrouper/plugins/aml/aml_grouper.go)\n\n2. Register the new plugin within the PodGrouper hub: [PodGrouper Hub Registration](https://github.com/NVIDIA/KAI-Scheduler/blob/bac4866ab5bba39cc76e900ced0c1da31339a4a1/pkg/podgrouper/podgrouper/hub/hub.go#L88)\n\n3. Generate the necessary RBAC resources by executing make manifests. This will update the kai-podgrouper ClusterRole to include the appropriate permissions for LWS.\n\nAdditional documentation on extending the PodGrouper functionality is available here:\n[PodGrouper Plugin Development Guide](https://github.com/NVIDIA/KAI-Scheduler/blob/main/docs/developer/pod-grouper.md)\n\nPlease let me know if any clarification is needed.", "Hi @singh1203 ,\n\nThat's great!

I???ll drop you an email soon so we can stay in sync as I dig deeper into the implementation. Looking forward to contributing to this feature together! \uD83D\uDE04\n\nBest regards,\nSaurabh", "Hi @singh1203 and @davidLif \uD83D\uDC4B \n\nThank you for all the hard work you???ve put into this integration ??? it???s greatly appreciated \uD83D\uDE4F \n\nOne of the teams now has a growing need for this, and I???d like to align on a clear date for when the LWS integration will be available in KAI. Would it be feasible to target merging it before July 15th? If it???s helpful, we could also agree on a near-term milestone for the initial integration and handle any remaining items post-merge.\n\nIf you???re tied up or have blockers you can???t resolve in time, just say the word and I will assist driving it across the finish line." ],

I'd like to help with this issue.\nI???ve read through the original issue #893 and understand that the goal is to ensure that copy constructors (e.g., in classes like TaskCommentImpl, ObjectReferenceImpl, etc.) copy all relevant fields by value and not reference ??? and omit persistence-related IDs where needed.\n\nWould it be okay if I take on this task? I???ll start by reviewing all *Impl entity classes and correcting the constructors where necessary.", "> Would it be okay if I take on this task? I???ll start by reviewing all *Impl entity classes and correcting the constructors where necessary.\n\nHey Omar! Certainly, go ahead :)\nI am looking forward to reviewing your Pull-Request!", "Hi!\n\nI'm currently working on the issue, and I came across a situation that could use your input.\n\nIn some classes like `TaskSummaryImpl`, fields such as `classificationSummary`, `workbasketSummary`, `primaryObjRef`, and the list of `attachmentSummaries` are currently being copied by reference inside the copy constructor.\n\nWhile reviewing this, I attempted to improve those constructors by using the `copy()` method provided by these fields. However, I noticed that the `copy()` methods intentionally omit persistence-related fields such as `id` and `taskId`. This behavior is now causing some tests (e.g., `TaskModelsCloneTest.testCloneInTaskSummary`) to fail, since the copied objects no longer retain those values.\n\nI???d like to confirm what direction to take moving forward. Here are a few possible approaches:\n\n* Option 1: Use a new `copyWithIds()` method (or similar)\nInstead of modifying `copy()`, introduce a method like `copyWithIds()` to explicitly include identifiers like `id` and `taskId` when needed (e.g., in UI or test layers).\n\n* Option 2: Modify the tests (they may be assuming too much)\nIf the design of `copy()` intentionally excludes persistence fields, perhaps the tests should be updated to reflect that ??? e.g., not asserting equality on `id` or `taskId` for copied objects.\n\n* Option 3: Keep the current copy-by-reference behavior\nIf copying by reference is acceptable for now (even if not ideal), we could leave the copy constructors as they are to avoid breaking tests or logic relying on shared object identity.\n\nLet me know which approach you'd prefer before I proceed with any changes.\nThanks in advance!", "Great finding Omar, I love the outlining of the options!\n\nWe will go with Option 3 and keep the by-reference behavior for all related attribute-entities. Non-Entity attributes like those of type `Instant` should still be copied by-value.\n\n(Actually quite interesting philosophically: If you as a father had children and I copied you, who'd be the father of them children? Or do I also need to copy the children?)" ],

This email verification input field appears after providing the correct username and password. \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Freshly install the Commons App\n2. Open the app and try to log in with your username and password\n3. An email verification input field should appear\n4. Make sure email verification input field is focused\n5. Tap on the `Enter` button in the software keyboard of Android\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nThe **IME Action** for the email verification input field should be either `Done` or `Go`. Also, the input field's height shouldn't increase when pressing the `Enter` button.\n\n### Actual behaviour\n\nThe `Enter` **IME Action** is displayed in the Android's soft keyboard, and tapping that increases the input field's height.\n\n### Device name\n\nPixel 6\n\n### Android version\n\nAndroid 14\n\n### Commons app version\n\nMain Branch\n\n### Device logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### Screen-shots\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7177768-7721-405e-a838-90b12a1a6a9c\n\n### Would you like to work on the issue?\n\nPrefer not",

Add `ExponentialBackoff bool` to `RepeatPolicy` struct in `/internal/digraph/step.go`\n2. Update scheduler logic in `/internal/digraph/scheduler/scheduler.go:334` to calculate interval as: `interval * (2^retryCount)`\n3. Use existing `node.State().DoneCount` to track retry attempts\n",

      "description" : "We are in the process of moving this repository to Read the Docs, and to do that we need to convert our pages from Markdown to RST. This issue is to transfer the Contribute to Mautic section: [https://contribute.mautic.org/contributing-to-mautic](https://contribute.mautic.org/contributing-to-mautic). You can also update and improve the content on these pages if you like - do check with the relevant team leads to ensure it's up to date and relevant.\n\n## Sections to migrate \nAs this is a large section I recommend that we take it one section at a time. Drop a message in the comments to be assigned to a section.\n\n- [x] Designer\n- [x] Developer\n- [x] Marketer\n- [x] Tester\n- [x] Translator\n- [x] Writing for Mautic\n- [ ] Event organiser\n- [ ] Web developer\n- [x] Server administrator\n- [x] Contributing financially\n- [x] Google Summer of Code @Iqmaa \n\nYou can do this in the current repo, as we've got a folder set up, `/docs`, which will be used for Read The Docs.\n\nYou can build this documentation locally by cloning this repository, and following these steps: https://github.com/mautic/user-documentation/tree/5.x?tab=readme-ov-file#build-documentation-locally. Change into the /docs folder and then (assuming you have DDEV and Docker/Colima installed) type `ddev config` and select `build/html `as the root folder when configuring DDEV. Then when complete, type `ddev start` and it'll give you the link to your local testing environment.\n\nIf you need to make a link file to add an external URL, please use the command line tool 'make link'. This will generate a reference macro and a link file for you.\n\nFor internal linking check the docs on using the [:ref: role](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/cross-referencing-with-sphinx.html#the-ref-role) for linking within the same document, and using [:doc: to link across pages](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/cross-referencing-with-sphinx.html#the-doc-role).\n\n**Please note: if you see folders called .revs these are old version control files from Grav. Ignore them! (they should be deleted) and instead work on the actual files.**\n\nWhen you've converted the file/s, **they need to live within the /docs folder**. We can create a structure using sub-folders to organise the sections. You also need to add the pages to the Table of Contents in the index.rst file for them to show on the menu. Docs on the ToC can be found [here](https://sublime-and-sphinx-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/indices.html).\n\nWe highly recommend that you use VS Code with Vale installed. Let us know if you have any problems.\n\nSome useful resources: \n- https://sublime-and-sphinx-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest guide to Sphinx/RST formatting\n- https://sublime-and-sphinx-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/references.html#use-the-external-links-extension how to do external links - always check the /docs/links directory first! You can use the terminal command '`make link`' to create the link file automagically.\n\nThere are many MD to RST tools out there which can help speed up the process, however you will still need to review your output to ensure it passes our Vale grammar rules. Headings must always be unique, as well.\n\nWe use the following for headings:\n\n```\nH1 ###\nH2 ***\nH3 ===\nH4 ---\nH5 ~~~\n```\n\nPlease ask in #t-education on Slack if you get stuck with anything!\n\n",

Working on the previous issue was my first experience with Gitpod, and it's sunsetting soon. \uD83D\uDE05 \nWould Gitpod be closed permanently or only for Mautic?\n\nI normally prefer to work locally. However, it's somewhat challenging to follow the docs to set up things locally, especially on Windows. So, Gitpod is very helpful. I never use GitHub's codespaces, though.\n\nBut I think the pricing is worth to be noted, just in case many folks will use the service:\n\n>  **How much does Codespaces cost?**\n>\n> Codespaces is free for individual use up to 60 hours a month and comes with simple, pay-as-you-go pricing after that. It???s also available for organizations with pay-as-you-go pricing and has pricing controls so any company or team can determine how much they want to spend a month. Learn more about Codespaces pricing for organizations [here](https://docs.github.com/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces).", "As far as I understand it, the free tier is being sunset for all. We will switch to codespaces instead come September. Indeed we should mention about the pricing for that, I think most people will be fine within their free tier." ],

Some use-sites might be able to get away with using these fields as non-null and lead to crashes, like https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/12401\n\nThis could have been caught early on if the `ListExtractor` function correctly indicated the nullable behavior of the returned value. Also, given the app is being rewritten in Kotlin, so the correct annotation would enforce the nullability handling at use-site.\n\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe `ListExtractor` shall correctly indicate the Nullable annotation for it's fields\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Screenshots/Screen recordings\n\n_No response_\n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_",

But in the attempt to unblock someone, I'm looking externally at how something like auth0 operates. They have the option to use a webview to maintain a universal session independent of app or web on the same device (in the same default browser), you might consider reviewing auth0's approach to intercepting and consuming web redirects back into your native app, and utilizing that same webview for token refreshes.

The settings page lives in `SettingsTab.tsx`. Each individual expandable card is a `ProviderSection.tsx` component. \n2. Refactor the UI of the card, while still maintaining its core functionality.

I have a small (very silly) question.\nThe `filter()` function in p5.js typically relies on its own built-in GLSL shaders. When you mention adding examples for p5.strands under `filter()`, do you mean writing a custom shader that leverages strands internally and showcasing that, and then using `filter()` function in the whole sketch created? I???m not quite sure how best to place strands examples inside the `filter()` reference?\n\nIn short, are you thinking creating sketches using p5.Strands and then using `filter()`? ", "> In short, are you thinking creating sketches using p5.Strands and then using `filter()`?\n\nI think so, to give users another potential way to discover strands (through looking up `filter`) in the examples.\n\nThere's a potential separate task we could do in the future where we replace the internal filter implementations with p5.strands versions, but I'll save that for a different issue \uD83D\uDE42 ", "hii, i am interested in this issue. can you please, assign it to  me\n" ],

      "description" : "## Summary\n\nThe Jupyter tab in OpenHands was not displaying input commands, only showing outputs. This made the Jupyter experience appear broken or incomplete, as users could see the results of IPython commands but not the commands themselves.\n\n## Environment\n\n- **OpenHands Version**: Latest (main branch)\n- **Runtime**: All runtimes with Jupyter support\n- **Browser**: All browsers\n- **Affected Component**: Frontend Jupyter tab\n\n## Bug Description\n\n### Expected Behavior\nThe Jupyter tab should display both:\n1. Input commands (the Python code being executed)\n2. Output results (the execution results)\n\n### Actual Behavior\nThe Jupyter tab only displayed:\n1. ??? Input commands: Missing\n2. ??? Output results: Working correctly\n\n### Impact\n- Users couldn't see what commands were being executed\n- Jupyter tab appeared broken or non-functional\n- Poor user experience for data analysis workflows\n- Made it difficult to understand the agent's Python code execution\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe issue was in the frontend action handling logic in `frontend/src/services/actions.ts`. The system was missing handling for `RUN_IPYTHON` actions to add input to the Jupyter state.\n\n**Missing Code:**\n```typescript\nif (message.action === ActionType.RUN_IPYTHON) {\n  store.dispatch(appendJupyterInput(message.args.code));\n}\n```\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Start OpenHands with Jupyter enabled\n2. Ask an agent to run Python code (e.g., \"Create a simple plot using matplotlib\")\n3. Navigate to the Jupyter tab\n4. Observe that only outputs are shown, not the input commands\n\n## Fix\n\nFixed in PR #9533\n\n## Labels\n\n- bug\n- frontend\n- jupyter\n- good first issue",

So you don't need to have RISC-V development board even to contribute to OpenVINO for these platforms \uD83D\uDE03 \n\n### What needs to be done?\n\n* Create `fp32` [Tanh](https://docs.openvino.ai/2025/documentation/openvino-ir-format/operation-sets/operation-specs/arithmetic/tanh-1.html) operation [JIT Emitter](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/emitters/plugin/riscv64/jit_eltwise_emitters.hpp) for RISCV64 platform with RVV1.0 support. Use OpenVINO [CPU plugin JIT emitters](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/emitters/README.md) documentation and [RISC-V \"V\" Vector Extension](https://github.com/riscvarchive/riscv-v-spec/releases/tag/v1.0) documentation for details.\n* Support your implemented JIT Emitter in the [JIT Executor](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/4ebe493140b90cbaaa68e2c71fe8e1dbd7461822/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/nodes/eltwise.cpp#L805).\n* Modify [RISCV64 kernel](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/4ebe493140b90cbaaa68e2c71fe8e1dbd7461822/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/nodes/kernels/riscv64/jit_uni_eltwise_generic.hpp#L19) (in both places: [create_eltwise_emitter](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/4ebe493140b90cbaaa68e2c71fe8e1dbd7461822/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/nodes/kernels/riscv64/jit_uni_eltwise_generic.cpp#L401) and [get_supported_precisions](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/4ebe493140b90cbaaa68e2c71fe8e1dbd7461822/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/nodes/kernels/riscv64/jit_uni_eltwise_generic.cpp#L528)) to apply developed JIT emitter.\n\nBefore emitter implementation, please, modify tests to be sure that developed functionality is covered by test:\n * Add `jit` kernel check in [activation](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/0a177ff48a7197bee7eeb08f4e81b9d0ce8db271/src/plugins/intel_cpu/tests/functional/custom/single_layer_tests/classes/activation.cpp#L229) test, the test must fail.\n* If test doesn't fail then add supported operation in [CPU activation test instantiation](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/0a177ff48a7197bee7eeb08f4e81b9d0ce8db271/src/plugins/intel_cpu/tests/functional/custom/single_layer_tests/classes/activation.cpp#L263) if it's absent.\n\n### Tests\nTests are disabled in default build, so ensure to add `-DENABLE_TESTS=ON` into cmake command during the project configuration.\n\n[GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest) is used for testing. CPU functional test target is [ov_cpu_func_tests](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/tree/master/src/plugins/intel_cpu/tests/functional). You can use `GoogleTest` filter:\n```sh\n# If you use xuantie-gnu-toolchain:\n<xuantie_install_path>/bin/qemu-riscv64 -cpu rv64,x-v=true,vext_spec=v1.0 ./bin/[platform]/[build_type]/ov_cpu_func_tests --gtest_filter=\"*smoke*Activation*Tanh*\"\n\n# If you use riscv-gnu-toolchain:\n<riscv_install_path>/bin/qemu-riscv64 -cpu rv64,v=true,vext_spec=v1.0 ./bin/[platform]/[build_type]/ov_cpu_func_tests --gtest_filter=\"*smoke*Activation*Tanh*\"\n```\n\n### Example Pull Requests\n\n* [Abs](https://docs.openvino.ai/2025/documentation/openvino-ir-format/operation-sets/operation-specs/arithmetic/abs-1.html) operation: https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/pull/30218\n\n\n### Resources\n\n- [Contribution guide - start here!](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n- [What is OpenVINO?](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino#what-is-openvino-toolkit)\n- [CPU plugin JIT emitters](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/src/plugins/intel_cpu/src/emitters/README.md)\n- [Blog post on contributing to OpenVINO](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n- [User documentation](https://docs.openvino.ai/)\n- [Intel DevHub Discord channel](https://discord.gg/7pVRxUwdWG) - engage in discussions, ask questions and talk to OpenVINO developers\n- [How to link your Pull Request to an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#manually-linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-the-pull-request-sidebar)\n-  [\"Cross compile OpenVINO???

Generate certificate using OpenBao PKI with standard enterprise settings\n2. Configure NRF and other NFs to use the OpenBao-generated certificate\n3. Attempt OAuth2 authentication between network functions\n4. Observe `crypto/rsa: verification error` in logs\n\nSample files that were used for creating the openbao, issuer and certs can be found in:\n\n[certificate-generation-files.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21008291/certificate-generation-files.zip)\n\n## Expected behavior\nOAuth2 authentication should work with certificates generated by standard PKI engines like OpenBao/Vault, similar to how it works with the pre-generated certificates.\n\n## Environment (please complete the following information):\n - free5GC Version: v4.0.1\n - OS: Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS\n - Kernel version: 5.15.0-142-generic\n - go version: I am using the free5gc provide container images, they don't have the go binary installed\n\n## Trace File\n### Configuration File\n\nSample NRF config:\n```\ninfo:\n  version: 1.0.2\n  description: NRF initial local configuration\n\nconfiguration:\n  MongoDBName: free5gc #

      "description" : "Currently, `/p` command is 1) undocumented, along with the function `rz_search_pattern()` 2) is limited.\n\nIdea is to expand `/p` command with multiple subcommands that will correspond to pattern generation commands - `pp`.\nThus, each `pp` subcommand, e.g. `ppd` should have a search sibling, e.g. `/pd` for search De Bruijn patterns, and so on.\n\nCurrent `/p` command could become `/pr` or something like that, to indicate that it is a generic search for any repeating pattern.\n\n```\n[0x100000960]> pp?\nUsage: pp<?>   # Print patterns\n???pp0 [<len>] # Print buffer filled with zeroes\n???pp1 [<len>] # Print incremental byte pattern (honor lower bits of current address and block size)\n???pp2 [<len>] # Print incremental word pattern\n???pp4 [<len>] # Print incremental dword pattern\n???pp8 [<len>] # Print incremental qword pattern\n???ppa [<len>] # Print Latin alphabet pattern\n???ppd [<len>] # Print De Brujin pattern\n???ppf [<len>] # Print buffer filled with 0xFF\n???ppn [<len>] # Print numeric pin pattern\n```",

      "comments" : [ "> Current /p command could become /p. or something like that, to indicate that it reads pattern from the current seek.\n\nThat's not what `/p` currently does. I should have made a better example, didn't think it could be misinterpreted this way.\n\nBetter description for current `/p n` would be \"search n byte patterns which show up in binary  more than once\". \n\n` /p 3` on \"ABCFABCGIIABC\" would return positions for \"ABC\", but it would also do the same when run on \"xyzABCFABCGIIABC\". \n\nIn case of `/p 3` run on \"mxyzabckabcxyzxyz\" it woud report \"xyz\" 3 positions, \"abc\" 2 positions because both of them can be found more than once. Current seek doesn't matter.\n\n\nAlso I am not sure if rest of your suggestion makes sense. The word pattern is a bit overloaded here. Just because 2 command descriptions contain word \"pattern\" doesn't mean they are related or that the type of patterns are in any way related.\n\nSome of the `pp` patterns like pp0 and ppf which make some sense to search are already better covered by `/x` and `/xr`  .\n\n`pp8 n` prints n words each incremented by one starting with current seek position (not the content) . `pp1` -`pp4` doe the same just limiting to lower 1-4 address bytes of current seek position. What do you expect to be searched ? Whole ascending number sequence or any of the words?\n\n`ppd` assuming it refers to de Brujin  sequence and there aren't multiple things named after him, why would you want to search for it in an executable. In specific situations it's useful strategy for trying every combination in less steps by overlaping the values, but searching for the pattern itself in binary makes little sense to me. Searching if executable contains hard coded (in the target executable)  de Brujin sequence, is no better than having a dedicated search command for Fibonacci sequence or nth digit of pi.\n\nAs  side note, seems like the `ppd` command currently itself is kind of buggy. `ppd 2` currently prints `4141` which is not a proper de Brujin sequence.  Based on what it prints for larger values I guess that `ppd n` prints \"the first n bytes in B([A-Za-z], 3) encoded as ascii bytes\". Maybe it's B(A-Za-z, 2) or something similar, hard to tell precisely by just eyeballing it. Partial de Brujin sequence has little value, and not being able to choose alphabet size or word length as makes the current implementation of command useless.\n\nHaving search commands for `ppa` and `ppn` also seems questionable due to the same reasons as de Brujin sequence.\n\nThe implementation of them also seem kind of buggy.\n\n`ppn` starts printing 4 digit codes in  LSB order from 0-99 (0000-9900) then jumps back to 0000 0000  1000-9000 (repeated twice in addition to being at the start of sequence)  and after a while it finally starts setting 3rd digit to non 0 values. \n\n`ppa` is similar (including repetition) but for 4 character (A-Za-z) words. Why 4 characters exactly, why fixed \"A-Za-z\", what is the actual logic behind the order?\n\nMost of my observations above are based on slightly outdated rizin version.\n\n\nThe way I look at most of the `pp` commands having them for printing those sequences are more or of swiss army knife style utilities. Occasionally they might be useful for something and it's nice to have a builtin command for generating them instead of having lookup some online tool or copy pasting snippet from stack overflow. But how you actually use the output of them is very situation specific.", "> Better description for current /p n would be \"search n byte patterns which show up in binary more than once\".\n\nThanks, fixed in the description.\n\n> ppd assuming it refers to de Brujin sequence and there aren't multiple things named after him, why would you want to search for it in an executable.

Searching if executable contains hard coded (in the target executable) de Brujin sequence, is no better than having a dedicated search command for Fibonacci sequence or nth digit of pi.\n\nNot whole patterns and not the executable. One of the valid scenarios - using Rizin to open memory dumps or coredumps, where *parts* of De Bruijn pattern could be located." ],

      "comments" : [ "Hi! Thanks for creating this issue!\r\n\r\nMy interpretation of that issue is that it is possible to use an `editor` in your own fork, but that `cz-cli` has decided to not do it. I have concerns with introducing an editor input instead of a one-line input.\r\n\r\nI agree with you that it's much easier to create nice commit messages in a much better format. I do however think there are some very large drawbacks. Firstly the default editor is vim, which scares a large portion of new developers. I think this library should be a helpful tool _especially_ for new developers. Secondly, I think it's a bit distracting to get redirected into some other interface (for all developers who have configured vs code as their default editor).\r\n\r\nIn my experience, most commit messages are short enough to be one line, and the few messages that I want to have longer, I write using GitKraken or in my favorite editor by just running `git commit`. I don't think we should optimize for the infrequent use case of having to write long commit messages when the majority of commit messages are short and where this change would hurt that majority of use cases.\r\n\r\nWith that said, I do agree that I would want to be able to write multiline commits with this tool as well (even though it's more of a nice to have). And it can also be seen as a motivator to write better and longer commit messages.\r\n\r\nI looked into creating my own inquirer prompt that would somehow allow multiline inputs but still stay in the same terminal context. We don't want to reinvent the wheel by creating a new fully-fledged editor but what we could do is allow you to write one line at a time. When you have written a line and press enter you get a new input. If you leave it empty we go to the next prompt but as long as you keep writing stuff you will get new inputs. This wouldn't allow you to go back and delete or change your commit message but maybe that's fine.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about all of this?", "I understand your concerns, and thanks for the detailed response. I did not realize that this is a feature not provided in `cz-cli` either. I do think that it is a great addition though, since I frequently write multi-line comments. I believe commits should be a kind of documentation, and having one-liner descriptions makes it harder.\r\n\r\nYour suggestion sounds like a nice compromise. I think that a hint of that behavior would help a lot, since an empty line acting as an end is not that intuitive.\r\n\r\nThere are some more suggestions that I would find more intuitive, although I am not sure if they are technically feasible. The discussion in `cz-cli` mentioned potentially parsing `\\n` or `\\r\\n` sequences. However, I find using `Shift + Enter` is a common shortcut in the web when entering new lines in fields that are submitted on `Enter`. If the terminal would allow such handling, I think it would be best.", "Yeah, actually that is a great suggestion! If you can detect `Shift + Enter` I think that is the best. It is easy to add a small hint saying `(press Shift + Enter for a new line)`. I think the easiest implementation is to create a custom prompt.\r\n\r\nThe greatest challenge is probably how to support going back to previous lines and delete stuff, but maybe you don't have to support that. ", "Indeed it might be out of this scope deleting previous lines, although I do think that it might be possible with some trickery. However, this is still just an extra \"nice to have\".", "we really need multilines commit, any news?" ],

We could just build an UDS validator and name it as UDS or IPC\n2. We could try building a proper Socket validator ( supporting tcp,uds etc). But that will involve adding support for quite a lot of socket types.\n3. We could try incrementally adding validation for each socket types for example an UDS validator a TCP validator and so on.\n\nI propose we build out the socket validations for each type one by one.

The proposal is to build out the socket validations for each type one by one and then debate about merging them into a 'socket' validator.",

A 'socket' does not inherently mean a UDS/IPC socket, and it should be explicitly called 'ipc' or 'uds'. The issue suggests creating a new 'uds' or 'ipc' validator or a 'socket' validator that supports all types of sockets.",

      "description" : "### Is there an existing issue already for this feature request/idea?\n\n- [x] I have searched for an existing issue, and could not find anything. I believe this is a new feature request to be evaluated.\n\n### What problem is this feature going to solve? Why should it be added?\n\nRight now, the `Database` CRD only manages the `owner` of the schema.\n\nPostgreSQL provides two privileges as part of the `GRANT` command on schemas: `CREATE` and `GRANT`. See [\"SQL Grant\"](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-grant.html).\n\nUsers are now using the post initialization scripts for this, making it imperative, one-off and thus fragile.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nProviding usage permissions on managed schema objects as part of the `Database` CRD.\n\nThe `GRANT` SQL command in Postgres has the following syntax:\n\n```sql\nGRANT { { CREATE | USAGE } [, ...] | ALL [ PRIVILEGES ] }\n    ON SCHEMA schema_name [, ...]\n    TO role_specification [, ...] [ WITH GRANT OPTION ]\n    [ GRANTED BY role_specification ]\n```\n\nBoth `GRANTED BY` and `WITH GRANT OPTION` are not suitable for a declarative environment typical of CloudNativePG, so we will focus only on `CREATE` and `USAGE`.\n\nA possible implementation could be:\n\n```yaml\n# ...\nspec:\n  schemas:\n  - name: app\n    owner: app\n    create:\n    - name: angus\n      type: grant\n    - name: brian\n      type: revoke\n    usage:\n    - name: angus\n      type: grant\n    - name: brian\n      type: grant\n# ...\n```\n\nThe default `type` is `grant`.\n\nFor example, the above will check that `angus` hasn't got yet the `create` privilege for the `app` database and run the required `GRANT CREATE ON app TO angus`. Similarly, if `brian` has `create` usage on the same `app` schema, it will run `REVOKE CREATE ON app FROM angus`.\n\nSee: [`REVOKE`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-revoke.html).\n\nPlease feel free to change the above proposal if you have a better idea.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nWe could do nothing, and delegate this operation to another tool.\n\nHowever, I personally think that this is a good responsibility for the `schema` management feature in the `Database` CRD.\n\n### Additional context\n\nN/A\n\n### Backport?\n\nNo\n\n### Are you willing to actively contribute to this feature?\n\nYes\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct",

How to add support for a new model\n\nImplement the `MixtureOfExperts` protocol. Specifically, you???ll need to:\n\n- Expose relevant MoE configuration flags.\n- Provide access to expert weights for EPLB to rearrange.\n- Forward EPLB-related arguments into the `FusedMoE` layer.\n\n\uD83D\uDCCC **Note on weight loading:**  \nFor models with **redundant experts**, you???ll need to carefully adjust the weight loading logic. `FusedMoE` returns an `expert_params_mapping` that reflects expert duplication, but you may need to modify the model class to ensure correct loading behavior.\n\n\uD83D\uDD0E Example: See how it???s done in [`deepseek_v2.py`](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/18343/files#diff-420f1cd67991a63cb419ca0e00e6f42cbe825864d0541e0662eeed2f9ddbd021).\n\n---\n\n### ??? How to add support for quantized models\n\nThis is usually even easier???just make sure EPLB-related arguments are properly forwarded in your quantization path.\n\n\uD83D\uDD0E Example: See [`fp8.py`](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/18343/files#diff-5511bfcc9c53f7d96517ad43e4087f6777bef21302da983f42cafae40a866644) for a minimal working change.\n\n---\n\n\uD83D\uDC4B **Want to contribute?**\n\nWe???d love your help in extending EPLB support! Feel free to comment below or open a draft PR???we???re happy to guide you through the process.\n\n### Alternatives\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Before submitting a new issue...\n\n- [x] Make sure you already searched for relevant issues, and asked the chatbot living at the bottom right corner of the [documentation page](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/), which can answer lots of frequently asked questions.",

Sending a numerical offset is sometimes fragile as offsets can change due to daylight savings or tz updates, so a tz string may be sent along with a timestamp instead. \r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have a means to validate that the timezone is valid, as per the cel timezone [supported formats](https://github.com/google/cel-spec/blob/master/doc/langdef.md#timezones) (eg. `TimeZone = \"UTC\" | LongTZ `, as I don't think `FixedTZ` makes as much sense in this context)\r\n\r\n**Problem it solves or use case:** \r\nConsider the following proto:\r\n```\r\nsyntax = \"proto3\";\r\npackage some.thing.v1;\r\n\r\nimport \"buf/validate/validate.proto\";\r\nimport \"google/protobuf/timestamp.proto\";\r\n\r\nmessage TimestampTZ {\r\n  google.protobuf.Timestamp ts = 1;\r\n  string tz = 2;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have something like:\r\n```\r\n  string tz = 2 [(buf.validate.field).string.timezone = true];\r\n```",

      "description" : "It would be useful if all objects from [`mgp`](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/blob/master/include/mgp.py) are `JSON` serializable, that is, that there is some kind of method that returns Python `Dict` of `mgp` objects. For example, when I'm writing a [query module for database export](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/100), I'm actually creating a `JSON` file with a list of nodes and relationships. Therefore, I have to reach every label, property, etc. of each `Vertex` and `Edge`. I would like to be able to just add properties as a list to my properties key, but then `mgp.Vertex.properties` is not `JSON` serializable. I solved this by going through all properties and creating new dictionary, but I think that the right place for this code would be inside mgp and not query module. Since we're going to create new utility modules similar to the export one, this feature may come in handy.\r\n\r\n",

      "description" : "### Title\n\n[Content] Insufficient text-to-background contrast\n\n### Description\n\nThe text color used in the following element has insufficient contrast with its background color. This results in very low readability, especially for users with low vision or color vision deficiencies. According to WCAG 2.2 Level AA, normal text must have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, and large text (over 18 pt or 14 pt bold) must meet 3:1. The detected text on the page does not satisfy these thresholds.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. go to /tutorials/setting-up-your-environment/\n2.  Locate to the following element:\n```\n<span style=\"color: rgb(215, 58, 73); opacity: 1; background-color: rgb(247, 247, 247);\"><img src=\"chrome-extension://jbbplnpkjmmeebjpijfedlgcdilocofh/img/icons/contrast.svg\" class=\"wave5icon\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" alt=\"CONTRAST ERRORS: Very low contrast\" style=\"border: none; vertical-align: middle; cursor: pointer; width: 44px; height: 44px; z-index: 1000; position: relative;\">function</span>\n```\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe word \"function\" is rendered in #D73A49 (a red tone) on a #F7F7F7 (light gray) background. This color combination produces a contrast ratio that is below 4.5:1, violating WCAG 2.1 Level AA contrast requirements for normal-sized text.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nText should maintain sufficient color contrast against its background to ensure readability. For normal-size text, the minimum ratio is 4.5:1; for large text (over 18pt or 14pt bold), 3:1. The color combination used should meet or exceed these thresholds.\n\n### Environments\n\n_No response_\n\n### Suggested Fix\n\nIncrease the contrast between the foreground (text) color and the background color.\n\n### Reference\n\nWCAG:\n* [Success Criterion 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#contrast-minimum)\n\nWCAG-T:\n* [G18: Ensuring that a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 exists between text (and images of text) and background behind the text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/general/G18)\n* [G145: Ensuring that a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 exists between text (and images of text) and background behind the text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/general/G145)\n\n### What is your operating system?\n\nNone\n\n### Web browser and version\n\n_No response_",

This seems illogical to me and gives too much freedom where it's not needed.\r\n3. Unlike C/C++ it allows `lL` and `Ll` suffixes (i.e. the mix of lower and upper case \"L\" to form a 'LL' suffix). Only `ll` and `LL` should be allowed.",

While the existing `lookup` command performs comprehensive object retrieval including WebFinger, there are many cases where users only want to test WebFinger configuration. This command takes a `@user@domain` handle as an argument and outputs only the WebFinger result (JRD) in JSON format.\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n- Create a new `webfinger.ts` file in the CLI directory, using `lookup.ts` as a reference\n- Utilize the existing `lookupWebFinger()` function from the Fedify library\n- Add the new command to `mod.ts` to register it with the CLI\n- Output results in clean JSON format for easy parsing\n- Handle WebFinger-specific errors appropriately\n\n## Why This Is a Good First Issue\n\n- **Independent feature**: Add new functionality without modifying existing code\n- **Learn structure**: Experience the complete process of adding a new CLI command\n- **Code reuse**: Great example of leveraging existing Fedify library functions\n- **Focused scope**: Single-purpose command with clear input/output expectations\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Create `fedify webfinger <handle>` command\n- [ ] Accept `@user@domain` format handles as input\n- [ ] Output WebFinger JRD results in JSON format\n- [ ] Handle invalid handles and WebFinger lookup failures gracefully\n- [ ] Register the command in the CLI module system\n- [ ] Add appropriate help text and usage examples\n\n## Files to Create/Modify\n\n- `cli/webfinger.ts` - New command implementation\n- `cli/mod.ts` - Register the new command\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```bash\nfedify webfinger @user@example.com\nfedify webfinger @mastodon@mastodon.social\n```",

According to [Flyte 1.9 release notes](https://flyte.org/blog/flyte-1-9-arraynode-execution-tags-new-navigation-and-more/), Flyte introduced ArrayNode map tasks, which are an evolution of the existing map tasks, providing more robust support for subtask executions. However, the current `current_context` does not include an index for array nodes.\n\n### Proposed Solution:\n1. **Motivation**: Adding an index to the `current_context` would help uniquely identify each array node's output, preventing overwrites and aiding in debugging.\n2. **Goal**: Modify the `current_context` to include a `node_index` field representing the map_task index.\n3. **Alternatives**: Generating random IDs for each instance, although this is less efficient and harder to trace.\n\nWould you like more details on how to proceed with this proposal or how to implement a workaround?\n\n### Example Code Block:\n```python\nfrom flytekit import current_context\n\n@task\ndef my_task():\n    ctx = current_context()\n    node_index = ctx.execution_id.node_id  # Hypothetical field addition\n    print(f\"Node Index: {node_index}\")\n```\n\nSources:\n- [Flyte 1.9 release notes](https://flyte.org/blog/flyte-1-9-arraynode-execution-tags-new-navigation-and-more/)\n\n---\nThis is an AI-generated response and your feedback is appreciated!

And adding virtual columns complicates things.\n\nWhen there are no virtual columns, there's no difference between \"table rows stored on disk\" and \"table rows seen by the engine\". But once a table has virtual columns, that distinction matters, and any code that assumes that the two are identical may get incorrect results.\n\nIn this case, it's likely that the `dolt diff` code is reading the rows directly out of storage and assuming that they match the table schema. Due to the way we store rows, adding a `NULL` to the end of a row doesn't change the bytes on disk: so for example, the row `(1, NULL)` and the row `(1,)` have the exact same bytes. So `dolt diff` is likely reading the latter and treating it like it's the former.\n\nI think that the best solution here is to simply omit any virtual generated columns from the output, since computing the correct value for the column would be more complicated and potentially slow.\n\nThe code for the diff command is in `go/cmd/dolt/commands/diff.go`. Most of the logic for the command works by writing SQL queries against [system tables](https://docs.dolthub.com/sql-reference/version-control/dolt-system-tables). Most likely this will involve changing the behavior of the `dolt_diff()` system table function to not have columns for virtual generated columns. That table function is defined in `go/libraries/doltcore/sqle/dtablefunctions/dolt_diff_table_function.go`.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions! There's a lot going on in these files because they interact with the SQL engine, but stepping through a sample `dolt diff` command in the debugger should help you figure out what each part is doing.", "Is anyone still working on this? I'm happy to work on this or #5861, whichever y'all think would be best to do first for dolt. Thanks." ],

So, perhaps, ```ramalama run --runtime whisper.cpp ggml-large-v3-turbo.bin``` gets you a bash prompt with a motd saying ```type 'transcribe /audio/jfk.wav' to blah blah blah etc```?  Crude compared to running or serving the chat-centric models, but still adds value to Ramalama and also to Whisper (which has had [broken CUDA support](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/issues/2032#issuecomment-2078881661) for nine+ months and isn't as slick wrt pulling images and mounting volumes).\n\nAlso, should the container files be pulling the latest whisper.cpp instead of the latest known to be good for Ramalama?

It has been a verrrrry long time since I've relied on a shell to create pipes for large data and I don't quite remember what the gotchas were, but I'm thinking there were at least a few.  I know even less about what might happen trying to pipe potentially massive, uncompressed audio files into the container on STDIN.  \n\n> I think it makes sense to allow grab output from stdout.\n\nRedirects aren't adequate?\n\n> Not sure what ramalama serve would do?\n\nIf the documentation on the whisper.cpp github is accurate, it seems like the provided web service is very basic.  All the examples are making requests via curl from the command-line.  I totally get it and that isn't criticism, but we're not talking about a convenient UI AFAICT.  I am aware that there exist some third-party front-ends, like https://github.com/litongjava/whisper-cpp-server + https://github.com/litongjava/listen-know-web, but I don't really know anything about them.\n\nFor me, personally, the most likely use-case for whisper.cpp is in generating subtitles for arbitrary videos (upon audio extracted w/ ffmpeg) or for transcribing and translating arbitrary audio sequences.  Command-line invocation over a bound directory seems adequate and possibly ideal.  It probably doesn't require any code overlap with whisper.cpp, using Ramalama as scaffolding to bring all the pieces together and offering a layer of abstraction wrt GPU config, system libraries, etc.  But I'm not deep into any of these techs or projects, so if there's a better vision / direction I'd love to hear about it.", "The stdout stuff should just work, we could even just have whisper grab /dev/stdin when it sees the \"-\". \n\nThe volume mount can also be marked ro,z so it is both readonly and available for reading based on SELinux.", "    podman run --rm -i --device nvidia.com/gpu=all \\\n    --mount=type=image,src=WHISPER.CPP-MODEL-SHORTNAME,destination=/mnt/models,rw=false,subpath=/models \\\n    --mount=type=bind,src=/[FQual-dir-of-user-inputfilewav]/,destination=/mnt/audio/USERFILE.wav,rw=false,z \\\n    ramalama-image /bin/sh -c \"whisper-main -m /mnt/models/model.file -f /mnt/audio/USERFILE.wav\"", "Slightly simpler.\n\npodman run --rm -i --device nvidia.com/gpu=all \\\n--mount=type=image,src=WHISPER.CPP-MODEL-SHORTNAME,destination=/mnt/models,rw=false,subpath=/models \\\n-v/[FQual-dir-of-user-inputfilewav]/:/mnt/audio/USERFILE.wav:ro,z \\\nramalama-image /bin/sh -c \"whisper-main -m /mnt/models/model.file -f /mnt/audio/USERFILE.wav\"\n\n", "Looks like `whisper -f -` is supported now, although the entire file needs to be flushed through the pipe I believe.\n", "> Looks like whisper -f - is supported\n\nIt does look that way, though I haven't prepared any large wav files to test with.  Thank you - your way is much better, I think, than binding a directory for a process that will only require one input.  Especially if it creates the possibility of chaining ffmpeg without intermediate conversion files.\n\nSo, consensus seems to be that ```cat jfk.wav | ramalama --runtime whisper.cpp run ggml-tiny.bin``` should produce and run something vaguely like ```podman run --rm -i --device nvidia.com/gpu=all --mount=type=bind,src=models/,destination=/mnt/models,rw=false ramalama /bin/sh -c \"whisper-main -m /mnt/models/ggml-tiny.bin -f -\"```  That doesn't seem too difficult at first blush.  I'll see what I can do in the coming days.\n\nThanks", "stdin seems fine to me. Also we can autodetect when there is stdin coming in, it's better for usability, you don't need the explicit '-' then, although we can have the ability to explicitly use stdin also '-', grep is an example of a command that does this and llama-run. Once llama-run is integrated into RamaLama, I plan on adding this to the ramalama run:\n\n`git diff | ramalama run granite-code \"Write a git commit message for this change\"`\n\nllm-gguf and ollama have this feature.\n", "Cool", "We now have images with whisper-server as an entrypoint.  Should be able to run one of these images directly and redirect the WAVE file to it.\n\n", "@ericcurtin not sure what the work needs to be done for this one?", "@ericcurtin What should we do with this one now?\n", "Hi all, just wanted to add a quick follow-up to this thread since I participated in the discussion.\n\nAt the time, my primary use case was generating subtitle files (e.g., SRT) for a side project. After our discussion, it became clear that the most direct path for Ramalama was to support piping `whisper.cpp`'s standard output, while my need was more centered around its file-based output features (like `-osrt`).\n\nSince my project priorities were tied to that specific workflow, I ended up moving in a different direction and didn't have the bandwidth to circle back to implement the `stdin`/`stdout` plan we discussed. Apologies for not closing the loop sooner.\n\nIt's great to see the issue is still active and that you're still actively improving Ramalama.  It's a great and undervalued tool.\n\n-FNG" ],

If so, the plugin may have different behavior. Usually, by not removing that attribute because it may break styles otherwise.\n\nHowever, our logic takes a very safe approach, of never deleting attributes if it's been referenced in CSS, even if the operator/check wouldn't match.\n\nFor example, suppose an element in an SVG had `preserveAspectRatio=\"xMidYMid meet\"`, with a CSS selector of `[preserveAspectRatio^=\"y\"]`.\n\nThis would not match, yet to be on the safe side, we will not remove the attribute. We do not actually check the operator and value, but only the key. Let's improve the logic to actually perform these checks so that we do remove the attribute when it's truly unnecessary.\n\nReferences:\n\n* https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors#syntax\n",

      "description" : "\nCurrently, the method `check_public_repo()` calls the GitHub API every time it is invoked. This results in redundant requests that can be optimized through caching. Implementing caching will improve performance and reduce the number of calls made to the GitHub API.\n\n**Proposed Changes:**\n\n1. **Implement Caching**:\n   - Introduce a caching mechanism to store the visibility status of repositories after the first API call.\n   - Use an in-memory caching solution like `cachetools` or utilize built-in Python caching decorators to manage the cache.\n   - Ensure that the cache is valid for a reasonable time period or until the repository status changes.\n\n2. **Modify `check_public_repo` Method**:\n   - Refactor the existing `check_public_repo` method to first check the cache for the repository status before making the API call.\n   - Update logic to cache the results from GitHub API calls.\n\n3. **Testing**:\n   - Write unit tests to verify that the caching mechanism works as intended and that subsequent calls to `check_public_repo()` use the cached data instead of hitting the GitHub API.\n\n4. **Documentation**:\n   - Update any relevant documentation to reflect these changes and ensure that the caching logic is well-understood for future developers.\n\n**Impacted Files**:\n- `app/modules/code_provider/github/github_service.py`: This is the primary file where the `check_public_repo` method is defined and updated.\n\n**Next Steps**: If approved, I will begin implementing the caching mechanism and refactoring the `check_public_repo` method. Following that, a pull request will be submitted for code review.",

      "description" : "### \uD83D\uDD0D Motivation\n\nCitation count provides a useful indicator of the academic impact of a publication. Automating the population of this field from Semantic Scholar saves manual effort and enhances bibliographic data quality in JabRef.\n\n### \uD83D\uDCCC Goal\n\nExtend the existing `SemanticScholarCitationFetcher` to retrieve the **citation count** for a given paper using the Semantic Scholar API and store it in a new BibTeX field `citationcount`.\n\n### \uD83D\uDEE0??? Tasks\n\n1. **Integrate citation count fetching**\n\n   * Implement logic in `org.jabref.logic.importer.fetcher.citation.semanticscholar.SemanticScholarCitationFetcher` using\n     `PaperDetails#getCitationCount()` from\n     `org.jabref.logic.importer.fetcher.citation.semanticscholar.PaperDetails`.\n\n2. **Add a new field**\n\n   * Define a new field `citationcount` in `org.jabref.model.entry.field.StandardField` (under JabRef-specific fields).\n   * Ensure that the field is recognized and included in citation fetcher updates.\n\n3. **Write tests**\n\n   * Add unit tests in\n     `org.jabref.logic.importer.fetcher.citation.semanticscholar.SemanticScholarCitationFetcherTest`\n     to verify that citation count is fetched and set correctly.\n   * Additonally, Mock or simulate Semantic Scholar API responses with citation counts.\n\n4. **UI integration**\n\n    * Add a new FieldEditor `CitationCount` (inspired by IdentifierEditor) and integrate it into the UI by modifying FieldEditors#getForField(...).\n    * Add an update button, which uses the SemanticScholarFEtcher to update the citation cound.\n\n### ??? Acceptance Criteria\n\n* When the fetcher is run on an entry with a DOI or title, and Semantic Scholar returns a citation count, the value is written to the `citationcount` field.\n* The value is stored as an integer.\n* Field appears in the entry editor in tab \"General\"\n\n\n### \uD83D\uDCDA Helpful resources\n\n* [[Semantic Scholar API](https://api.semanticscholar.org/)](https://api.semanticscholar.org/)\n* [`[PaperDetails](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/src/main/java/org/jabref/logic/importer/fetcher/citation/semanticscholar/PaperDetails.java)`](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/src/main/java/org/jabref/logic/importer/fetcher/citation/semanticscholar/PaperDetails.java)\n* [`[SemanticScholarCitationFetcher](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/src/main/java/org/jabref/logic/importer/fetcher/citation/semanticscholar/SemanticScholarCitationFetcher.java)`](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/src/main/java/org/jabref/logic/importer/fetcher/citation/semanticscholar/SemanticScholarCitationFetcher.java)\n* [[How to contribute to JabRef](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n* [[Developer Docs](https://devdocs.jabref.org/)](https://devdocs.jabref.org/)\n\n",

      "description" : "## Motivation\n\nThe [ICORE (International CORE Conference Rankings)](https://www.core.edu.au/home) is a ranking of computer science conferences (A*, A, B, C). In JabRef, we want to add a new field that stores the ICORE ranking of a given conference. Users often want to know how highly ranked a paper's venue is. You can search conferences manually via the [ICORE website](https://portal.core.edu.au/conf-ranks/), but this should be automated.\n\nExample search result\n\n<img width=\"1280\" height=\"246\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2f0efc5-f6ef-48b8-8e81-929e54cb9b3d\" />\n\n## \uD83D\uDCCC Goal\n\nWhen a BibTeX entry includes a conference title like:\n\n`ACIS Conference on Software Engineering Research, Management and Applications (SERA)`\n\nThe tool should:\n\n- Extract the acronym in parentheses ??? SERA.\n- Search the ICORE rankings for this acronym.\n- If a match is found (e.g. SERA has rank C), populate the new icoreranking field with that value.\n- If no exact match is found, fall back to fuzzy matching using similarity scoring (> 0.9).\n\n## \uD83D\uDEE0??? Tasks\n\n- [ ] Move DuplicateCheck#similarity from org.jabref.logic.database to a new utility class: org.jabref.logic.util.strings.StringSimilarity.\n- [ ] Add ICORE.csv to src/main/resources/\n- [ ] Create a class that loads and indexes the ICORE data at instantiation.\n- [ ] Implement the logic to detect and return the ranking from a full conference name.\n- [ ] Create a new field: ICORANKING ('icoranking') and add it to org.jabref.model.entry.field.StandardField at the // JabRef-specific fields section.\n- [ ] Create a new field editor ICoreRankingEditor (inspired by IdentifierEditor) and integrate it into the UI by modifying FieldEditors#getForField(...). - Tghe lookup button (like DOI lookup) to lookup the ranking in the `CSV` file\n- [ ] Write unit tests for acronym matching and similarity fallback.\n\nTest end-to-end behavior via TDD.\n\n##  \uD83D\uDCDA Helpful resources\n\n[How to contribute to JabRef](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing)\n\n[JabRef Developer Documentation](https://devdocs.jabref.org/)\n\nICORE Rankings CSV: https://portal.core.edu.au/conf-ranks/ ???

      "description" : "This has happened for a long time, but I should really file an issue, so here it is. It seems to probably happen more commonly in Chrome, and it seems to be harder to reproduce in Firefox (I wasn't able to reproduce it in FF in my testing right now, @0HyperCube mentions in the comments below that he has encountered it in FF). See `NumberInput.svelte`.\n\nWhen you click and drag a number input field of the increment (not range) style, meaning the kind you can drag infinitely left or right, it will sometimes teleport the value to a wildly different value from the one it started with. This can be reproduced by drawing a rectangle and dragging left and right on its stroke weight parameter in the Properties panel repeatedly in quick, small left and right drags until occasionally it will make a big jump.\n\nI hypothesize this is caused by weirdness in the event ordering and mouse position reporting with the [pointer lock](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_Lock_API) API, and it might be related to the widget being broken in Safari: #2038. I recommend logging the values that are being reported by the API and current state every frame to narrow down when the events occur and produce the discrepancy.\n\nAt the the 4-second mark in this video, we see it jump from `131.3` to `17.3` immediately when the click-and-drag begins:\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61b1b1e6-4560-4555-aac5-f7b54cbfacb9",

Currently I've to write hybrid unit tests by using PowerMockito along with mockK library to use the [suppress functionality](https://github.com/powermock/powermock/wiki/Suppress-Unwanted-Behavior) provided by PowerMockito, due to lack of such cool feature or function in mockK.\r\n\r\n#### `WhiteBox`\r\n[WhiteBox](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.powermock/powermock-reflect/1.6.4/org/powermock/reflect/Whitebox.html) is another useful one from PowerMockito which is missing in mockK and would really be helpful if available on this library.\r\n\r\nCurrent Specs:\r\n* MockK version: V1.12.3 \r\n* OS: Mac OS\r\n* Kotlin version: 1.6.0\r\n",

      "comments" : [ "###  Wishlist \n\n1. **Notifications:** Notifications are one of the most important part of any monitoring stack.  It doesn't matter how well the actual monitoring works if you can't be properly notified.  So I would love to see the following in a proper notification module:\n - Central notification channel management.  I shouldn't need to go to every single monitor to change a notification channel.  I shouldn't have to make the same update multiple times (i.e. changing a discord webhook to a new discord webhook for example)\n- Pluggable notification channels.  By this I mean, the Bluewave team may have Slack, Discord, Telegram, and email included out of the box, some may want an obscure notification channel that they use (NTFY for example).  Make it simple to add a new notification channel module without having to modify core code.  This allows the system to be adaptable and expandable without having to have the Bluewave team be the choking point.  The team can chose to bring in any quality and useful channels the community builds in to the core product if they so desire to.\n- Ability to add multiple notification channels of the same type.  I should be able to have multiple discord channels, maybe one for prod, one for non-prod.\n- Ability to send to multiple notifications for the same monitor.  Example, disk runs low on serverA I want to notify the support discord channel so that maybe one of the engineers that has a minute can grab it.  At the same time, or maybe with a configurable delay, I want to notify the on-call pager via another means (PagerDuty, OpGenie, Grafana On-Call, etc) so they are paged and can act on it.\n- Notification escalations.  Notification has been sent, it hasn't been acknowledged and is still alerting XX time later (configurable, minutes, hours, etc) it escalates to a different notification channel.\n- Custom service monitoring.  Ability to monitor a service on a server is paramount to a monitoring solution.  Sometimes a service doesn't expose a port or endpoint or that endpoint is restricted.  So being able to monitor for a process on a server where capture is already running, would be useful. \n\n\n2. **Other**\n- Tags on monitors that allow me to search and filter based on them.  This would include in the notifications.  For example, I would like to be able to notify a customer when their service is having an issue.  So if I could setup the monitor that's monitoring their service with a tag, then on the monitor add a filter for tag = XXX, send to this channel, but also send to this other channel (for a production support team for example). Example of this concept is Grafana Alerting: https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/alerting/configure-notifications/\n- Searchable monitors.  Currently with ~150 monitors in Checkmate, I have to browse through all the pages to find the monitor I want to look at.  \n- Page size preference remembered sessions (at the user level would be ideal, along with having a global configurable default value).  Related to the above, if I change it to 25 per page and then refresh, it defaults back to 5.  Super annoying.\n- Custom script execution.  Similar to custom service monitoring, being able to create scripts or plugins that run and do something more complex than up/down and reports back a healthy or not makes a monitoring system extremely expandable and adaptable.  A good example is in Icinga/Nagios/Checkmk eco-system.  The parsing is simplified in that the return code of the plugin has to be 0, 1, 2, 3 for Ok, Warning, Critical, Unknown.  Then no need to have to parse all sort of different outputs.  https://www.monitoring-plugins.org/doc/guidelines.html#AEN74 \n- Websocket and gRPC monitoring.  Many of the endpoints I need to monitor are one of the two.  Being able to query them and check for successful replies is crucial to a complete monitoring solution.\n- Event handlers.  Being able to trigger event handlers based on certain criteria.  For example, if a service dies, restart it, however if that service dies more than once in a given time period, send a notification. \n- Ability to export metrics in prometheus style metrics.  Monitoring and observability are two different things, so even though I have monitoring in place I'm still going to have an observability platform.  Since the main metrics are being gathered by capture/checkmate, it would be nice if at a minimum those could be exposed as prometheus metrics, even better if there was a way to provide a prometheus compatible url and have it do the remote write.  \n\nAll these are features in other monitoring systems.  In all the cases where the ability to use a custom plugin, module, etc is proposed I would find it perfectly acceptable to require the plugin be written in a certain language and have other requirements (for example the return code of the custom script/plugin) to make it more easily to be \"plugged-in\" to checkmate/capture and to keep the system running efficiently.", "I think that we need the ability to group uptime and infrastructure monitors together, ie) all of the VMs in one section, all of the websites in a different section, external sites in a third section etc. ", "Ability to have agents in remote sites that push so no port forwarding needed in remote sites as the agents will send a heartbeat so as long as the server is reachable from the agent it will work (a plus if the agent can be used as a probe to reach other devices in that network)", "> I think that we need the ability to group uptime and infrastructure monitors together, ie) all of the VMs in one section, all of the websites in a different section, external sites in a third section etc.\n\nI think tagging monitors won't work in this case - you want them virtually grouped on the dashboard, right?

However, you are mixing too many topics in this issue. Please keep each issue focused to a single aspect. You can specify relationships between issues to link them if needed. Therefore, I ask you to file new issues from your second comment so that they can be independently discussed.\n\nRegarding the limited width of the select input of plexer components. The limitation to 5 bit wide selection inputs (choice among 32 inputs/outputs is for many practical situations sufficient. It was also in line with the maximum word width of 32 bits. The maximum bus width was increased to 64 bit some time ago. So, it may make sense to increase the width to 6 bits. The main reason for the current limitation to 5 bit is of a practical nature: The component symbol needs to scale with the number of inputs/outputs addressed via the select input. Too big symbols are hard to handle in schematic entry. Each new bit would double the size of the plexers. Therefore, an increase to 6 bit or 8 bit might be feasible, but not beyond that.\n\nAnyway, such wide plexers would be typically used in memories and for these applications, we have dedicated RAM/ROM component models. The Bit Selector component might be also suitable in some cases, but is limited to a 64-bit-wide input. If you have a concrete needs, please describe them in more detail so that we can evaluate if your enhancement request is in line with the goal of this project.\n\nPRs to address this and your other issues are welcome!\n\nPS: Showing the values on all signals by default is less practical than one might think at first glance. Once circuits grow in complexity such additional elements on the screen become distracting. Additionally, the required additional paint operation would limit the simulator performance considerably.\n\nPPS: The Write Enable (WE) input of data registers behaves consistently to its specification in the documentation and the expected behaviour of such components in reality. WE needs to be active before the active edge selected via the Trigger attribute. Only, when you choose the Trigger to be level-sensitive, you obtain latch behaviour, where WE is also evaluated during the active level of the enable input due to the transparent nature of latches in this mode.\n\nPPPS: Finally, the problems you observe while doing edits during an active simulation: We fixed several issues in this area since the last official release. Please, check whether the problem persists in our [Nightly builds](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution?tab=readme-ov-file#nightly-builds).\n\n\n\n", "my design requires at least 8-bit mux (would equal 256 output lines, 32-bit and 64-bit might be a bit too large, unless you have a linear array type massive memory cell output). the value being next to the data line by default/option would make debugging more simple, for me at least.\n\nall these are from my viewpoint, not from any other viewpoint. just reporting in usability and other issues at once. all other issues were \"resolved\" by getting to know how some non-intuitive choices of ui actually work. this issue deals with how components work in general.\n\nedit: if logisim-evolution will not support up to 8-bit mux, then I might put two such things serially to add virtual 10-bit mux. ie 4-bit to 16x 4-bit muxes to get full 8-bit mux.\n\nimo: not often used is an excuse for missing feature.", "> my design requires at least 8-bit mux (would equal 256 output lines, 32-bit and 64-bit might be a bit too large, unless you have a linear array type massive memory cell output). \n\nIt is not planned to extend the maximum bus width beyond 64 bit.

Test Cleanup Utilities\\n```javascript\\n// Standardized cleanup for all async operations\\nclass TestCleanup {\\n  constructor() {\\n    this.timers = new Set();\\n    this.promises = new Set();\\n  }\\n  \\n  registerTimer(timer) { this.timers.add(timer); }\\n  registerPromise(promise) { this.promises.add(promise); }\\n  \\n  async cleanup() {\\n    // Clear all timers\\n    this.timers.forEach(timer => clearTimeout(timer));\\n    // Await all promises\\n    await Promise.allSettled([...this.promises]);\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 2. Improved Test Structure\\n- Before/after hooks that properly clean up resources\\n- Timeout wrappers for all async operations\\n- Consistent error handling patterns\\n\\n### 3. Performance Test Utils\\nImplement the missing PerformanceTestUtils mentioned in the analysis\\n\\n## Benefits:\\n- Eliminate flaky tests\\n- Faster test execution\\n- Better CI/CD reliability\\n- Easier test debugging\\n\\n## Credit\\nThis issue is based on the thorough test analysis by @mikkihugo in PR #44, particularly the test-status.md report.\\n\\n/cc @mikkihugo",

Open a request\n2. Write something in the body\n3. Send request and see that body does **not** disappear\n4. Change to another tab (e.g. headers)\n5. Send request\n6. Change to body tab and see that body is gone\n\n**Expected behavior**\nIt should not matter which tab is open while sending a request. Body should not disappear.\n\n**Screenshots/Video**\n\n\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\n - OS: macOS\n - Version v0.1.0\n\n**Additional context**\nIt's possibly due to the request body `MonacoEditor` not being rendered. I think that the request body content is read before sending the request. If the editor is not mount however, there is no body content to send --> empty request body. Should be fixable if we do only save the request body when the body tab is actually currently open or when switching away from the body tab.\n",

I have two ideas for this:\r\n\r\n- Get the `pageExtensions` parameter from the user's `next.config.js` or `next.config.mjs` configuration file.\r\n  * Use the [`loadConfig`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/b31b0ee0cceeb68c01363cb1adb95ea8041c9974/packages/next/src/server/config.ts#L764) function to get the configuration. But unfortunately, this function is an async function, and the ESLint create function [does not support async calls](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/15394). So this solution does not work.\r\n  * Read the configuration file via `require()`. If the user is only using the CommonJS and exporting a configuration object, this is easy enough to get the `pageExtensions` parameter. But if the user is using an `ES Module` or exporting a sync or async function, I can't get the `pageExtensions` parameter. Because the `require()` function doesn't support dynamic import of an `ES Module`. So this solution also fails.\r\n- Provide an ESLint option named `pageExtensions`.\r\n  * This is the only option that works so far.\r\n\r\nThis is my current idea, feel free to discuss it.", "Hello, I am new to open source and want to work on this issue.

      "description" : "# \uD83C\uDF1F Open Call for Contributions: Gemma 3n Recipes \uD83D\uDC8E\n\nHello community! \uD83D\uDC4B\n\nWe got really excited last week with the full release of [Gemma 3n](https://huggingface.co/blog/gemma3n) \uD83D\uDC8E by Google DeepMind. With that, we???d like to open this call for contributions to explore the amazing *minimal* recipes the community can build with it!\n\nThis project follows the same principles as our previous [Hugging Face Llama Recipes](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface-llama-recipes), which you might also want to check out. You can refer to that repository to see the previous [call for contributions](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface-llama-recipes/issues/43) and discover what the community created. You may also want to browse the [Gemma Cookbook](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemma-cookbook) for further inspiration.\n\n> Star the project to boost it! :star:\n\n## \uD83D\uDCA1 What You Could Build\n\nGemma 3n is specifically designed for low-resource (on-device) environments and is a **multimodal model** that supports text, image, video, and audio inputs ??? so we???d love to see *minimal* recipes where those capabilities shine! ??? We highly recommend checking out the [blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/gemma3n) to better understand the possibilities and spark your creativity. Additionally, check out the already available recipes to understand what could be a good fit!\n\nYou could:\n- Showcase agentic or interactive uses of the model\n- Build recipes using `transformers`, `llama.cpp`, or `transformers.js`\n- Create fine-tuning notebooks for domain-specific tasks using any of the supported modalities\n- Or anything else that pushes the boundaries of on-device and multimodal AI! \uD83E\uDD16\n\nHave your own idea?\uD83D\uDCA1 Even better, we???d love to hear it!\n\n## \uD83D\uDCDD How to Contribute\n\n1. **Open a New Issue**\n   - If you???re interested in contributing, please [open a new issue](#) with a descriptive title.\n   - Use the issue to outline your idea and gather early feedback.\n\n2. **Let Us Know**\n   - Comment on this post to let us know you???ve opened a new issue. We???ll update the main list with a link to your idea.\n\n3. **Start Building**\n   - Once you???ve shaped your plan, go ahead and implement your idea \uD83D\uDC68???\uD83D\uDCBB.\n\n4. **Submit a Pull Request**\n   - When you???re ready, open a Pull Request (PR) that links back to your issue.\n   - Mention the issue in your PR description so it's easy to track.\n\n5. **Update the README**\n   - Don???t forget to add a short description of your contribution to the `README.md`, so others can find and reuse it easily.\n\n## \uD83D\uDCAC For New Contributors\n\nIf you???re just starting out in open source, we recommend reading our [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface-gemma-recipes/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md). It includes helpful tips to get you up and running.\n\nWe can???t wait to see what we???ll build together! \uD83E\uDD20\n",

This is similar to #10281 but specific to the appearance.\n\nFor example, when saving settings [we include an ellipsis](https://github.com/google/site-kit-wp/blob/8f1c16bb71bcf5091bc5b56d535e03973d4b9b36/assets/js/components/settings/SettingsActiveModule/Footer.js#L153-L155), but in nearly all other similar buttons we do not.\n\n---------------\n\n_Do not alter or remove anything below. The following sections will be managed by moderators only._\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n\n* When module settings are being saved, after CTA has been clicked and CTA enters in progress state, only spinner icon should be showing, text shouldn't be changing to the `Saving` and ellipsis should not show `...`\n\n## Implementation Brief\n\n* [x] Update `assets/js/components/settings/SettingsActiveModule/FooterPrimaryAction.js`\n  * Remove https://github.com/google/site-kit-wp/blob/4946f1a5df79dfac2ac8f94c6a03283a163241a1/assets/js/components/settings/SettingsActiveModule/FooterPrimaryAction.js#L75 and conditional wrapper around it.\n  * Spinner is already integrated, so no further change is needed\n\n### Test Coverage\n\n* No updates expected\n\n## QA Brief\n\n1. Open any module's settings in `Site Kit > Settings`.\n\n2. Make any changes to the module, when the settings are being saved, the button text should stay as `Confirm changes` and not `Saving...`. Refer attached screenshots.\n\n#### Before\n\n<img width=\"538\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bb85e75-191a-445f-aa63-a17394d88c44\" />\n\n#### Latest change\n\n<img width=\"685\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55bcc527-4db0-4535-bdd5-a93952abfa30\" />\n\n## Changelog entry\n\n* Update the \"Confirm changes\" module settings button to retain its label while saving.\n\n",

(2)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen moving the metrics to YAML, to be able to achieve the same output as above, I need to **manually** add the (1) header and the recommendation.\r\n\r\n1. The header we can generate, since we have all the information \r\n2. The \"This metric is recommended..\" I don't think we have this field in the data model, so we might need to include it\r\n\r\nIn the end, it would be great if the only thing required to generate consistent markdown, are the placeholders such as\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n<!-- semconv metric.system.cpu.time(metric_table) -->\r\n<!-- endsemconv -->\r\n\r\n<!-- semconv metric.system.cpu.time(full) -->\r\n<!-- endsemconv -->\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd that would generate\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n### Metric: `process.runtime.jvm.memory.usage`\r\n\r\nThis metric is [recommended][MetricRecommended].\r\n\r\n<metric table>\r\n\r\n<metric attribute table>\r\n```\r\n\r\n",

It is clear that many contributors are not reading the contributing.MD or the documentation update readme. \n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nWe are a welcoming community and we would like to include all regardless of their learning methodology. Some read, others watch. So, we would like a video to welcome contributors and walk them through the basics of contributing to KubeStellar. Once completed, we can create a shortcut url and give it to anyone with a question about making a contribution. This saves everyone time.\n\n### Are you willing to contribute?\n\n- [ ] Yes, I'd like to help implement this feature.\n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_",

Go through the existing contributing docs to identify the most important parts that are usually missed ??? like assigning issues, installing the project, and generating a preview for doc PRs.\n\n2. Write a short, beginner-friendly script that walks contributors through those steps with simple explanations.\n\n3. Record a video walkthrough ??? I???ll use a screen recorder to show everything live (repo set-up,find the good first issue, assigning issues, making a PR, generating previews, etc.) so contributors can follow along easily.\n\n4. Once I have a draft ready, I???ll share the video link here for feedback before finalizing.", "This sounds cool to me.

This is being deprecated\n```shell\nThis built-in Gadget is deprecated and will be removed on v0.42.0 (July 2025).\nPlease check https://inspektor-gadget.io/docs/latest/gadgets/ to get more details on\nhow to switch to image-based Gadgets.\n\nError: required flag(s) \"metrics-config\" not set\n\n```\nI am assuming that the documentation will cover how , for existing gadgets, prometheus can be deployed within a k8s\ncluster and how to scrape the metrics from the gadgets that are deployed? ( plus how to expose metrics to an external\nprometheus instance). If this is the case may I suggest the following as I believe this is going to be more than a few\nlines of markdown.\n\n- [ ] Create a new section in the documentation that covers how to deploy prometheus within a k8s cluster\n- [ ] Create a new section in the documentation that covers how to scrape metrics from gadgets that are deployed gadget by gadget\n\nUpdating the document gadget by gadget will allow me the time to look into each gadget to see what metrics are available\nand how to create a suitable config.yaml to scrape those metrics into a prometheus server.  The original documentation \nthat covers things such as the visualization of the metrics may be best handled by linking out to existing documentation\nfor both prometheus and grafana. This will allow us to focus on the gadget specific metrics and their configuration and \ncollection.\n\nyour thoughts?", "I agree with it, just to summarize:\n1. Extend https://inspektor-gadget.io/docs/latest/reference/export-metrics/ with information about how to deploy Prometheus as it was done in the legacy documentation https://inspektor-gadget.io/docs/latest/legacy/prometheus/#guide\n2.  For each gadget, show how to configure it to export metrics, also describe the metrics that it provides), as done here https://inspektor-gadget.io/docs/latest/gadgets/profile_blockio#exporting-metrics\n\nThe idea of this issue was to cover the first point, but if you also want to work on the second part that's appreciated!

It's not possible to ask our users to install a legacy version of ffmpeg, especially since it will require users to build from the source.\n\nTo fix this, we have to decide to use the latest LTS version, 7.1, which is in active maintenance mode.\n\nI believe API changes will be between the current version, 6.0.0, and the new version (7.1.1). So, the current implementation of the wasmedge-ffmpeg plugin will also need to be modified.\n\n\n### Details\n\nThe following action items should be finished:\n\n- [ ] Update to the new ffmpeg version 7.1.1\n- [ ] Modify the implementation of wasmedge-ffmpeg\n- [ ] Ensure the CI passes for building and testing\n\n### Appendix\n\n_No response_",

The proper fix is to fully support nested parallelism in RDF, which requires more work. The goal is simply to make nested parallelism in RDF safe\n\nThis is a matter of correctness, even though typically users do not spawn TBB tasks from within the RDF event loop.\n\n###

task starts and take a slot number, then ROOT::Internal::TBranchIMTHelper::Wait triggers the start of an inner RDF task that takes a second slot number without returning the first one, leading to an error in builds with asserts enabled, and undefined behavior in builds without asserts). Attached the stacktrace of the relevant thread (not the one that errors out, but the one that steals the last slot number so another thread doesn't find it and errors out).\n\n### ROOT version\n\nany\n\n### Installation method\n\nany\n\n### Operating system\n\nany\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

Since swift-syntax can't depend on swift-testing (which would incur a circular dependency since swift-testing depends on swift-syntax), users need to manually specify a failure handler like the following, that fails the swift-testing test: `Issue.record(\"\\($0.message)\", fileID: $0.location.fileID, filePath: $0.location.filePath, line: $0.location.line, column: $0.location.column)`\n> - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2647\n\n\nThe SwiftPM template for `swift package init --type macro` should be update to provide an idiomatic way to write a Swift Testing test to verify and validate a macro.\n\n",

A feature like this would allow us to efficiently send a warning to one or more players, which would then justify us to take actions with more confidence and with a longer punishment time.\n\nWith the current solutions, there's no effective way of communicating with the player in a way that proves, without denial, that we are authenticated as a moderator. Currently, players may ignore chat messages or even completely disable the chat, which would make any form of communication hopeless. A form of communication like this would be important before taking more aggressive actions, such as kicking or banning.\n\nA feature like this would allow us to scare most players who aren't fully aware of the consequences. Allowing us to send a message to a group of players, regardless of whether they are blocking or not, without consequences. This can be applied in chaotic cases that casual methods of moderation wouldn't be feasible, such as in Linear and Multeasymap servers.",

Here are the steps I followed:\n\n1. Set up a local instance of the credentials service and accessed the Django admin at:  \n   `http://credentials.local.openedx.io/admin/credentials/usercredential/`\n\n2. Created test `UserCredential` records:\n   - `testuser1`: `status=\"awarded\"`, `credential_content_type=CourseCertificate`\n   - `testuser2`: `status=\"revoked\"`, `credential_content_type=CourseCertificate`\n   - `testuser3`: `status=\"awarded\"`, `credential_content_type=ProgramCertificate`\n\n3. Used the sidebar filters:\n   - Selecting **\"Awarded\"** correctly showed only `testuser1` and `testuser3`.\n   - Selecting **\"Revoked\"** correctly showed only `testuser2`.\n   - (Screenshots attached below.)\n\n4. I also monitored the page load time using browser DevTools and found no noticeable slowness.\n\nBased on the above, I was **not able to reproduce** the issue where revoked certificates appear when using the \"Awarded\" filter. Everything seems to work as expected in this setup.\n\nWould you mind sharing a few more details to help narrow this down?\n- The Open edX release or commit hash you're using\n- Any local modifications to `settings.py`, `admin.py`, or the `UserCredentialAdmin` config\n- Sample data that triggers the problem on your end\n\nThanks!\n" ],

Implementing something like that using current maplibre popups requires overriding default behaviour, and using internal functions. I managed to make it somehow work, but the code feels hacky and relies on copying the existing maplibre popup position calculations, so adding it internally would be much nicer. \n\nHere is an example of how this functionality would work:\nCurrent behaviour:\n\nhttps://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/34219675/237748834-020d8de5-4794-4d66-a707-a75e024cf822.mov?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.ar7NNsUQE51LFkHCV6ARxmZObDW7Uy2_Tk0b4-R7T3c\n\nDesired behaviour:\n\nhttps://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/34219675/237748895-3b29bf9e-8347-408b-9744-6ae1a78e8137.mov?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.blg5w4qHN74b3NsfCql0a0Hv9AnLTTNSIOHtkvFkwI8\n\n## Impact\nIf implemented as an additional parameter e.g. `options.popupPadding` strictly related to popups it does not have any impact. It would be an extension that users can use as needed. Otherwise, if we rely on existing map padding, it might change the behaviour for existing applications (which I would rather avoid) \n\n## Implementation\nI'm open and happy to add this feature myself, but would like to get your opinion on that first, and if it's a wanted feature, discuss the implementation approach.

      "comments" : [ "<!-- Answer -->\nThis issue appears to be caused by incomplete or incorrect handling of files with transfer_method=remote_url in the workflow engine's HTTP request node. Instead of fetching the remote file and attaching it as multipart/form-data, the system is inserting a __multipart_placeholder__ field, which results in no actual file data being sent.\n\nRecent pull requests introduced stricter file type validation and changes to how remote_url files are processed, which may have affected this functionality. Specifically, the relevant logic in the workflow engine and file factory was updated to enforce that the detected file type (from extension and MIME type) matches the specified type, and any mismatch now raises an error. However, if the fetch or conversion step for remote_url files fails or is incomplete, you get the placeholder behavior you observed instead of the expected file upload\n([PR #17557](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/17557), [PR #16203](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/16203)).\n\nThere is no documented workaround for this in the current version. If possible, monitor for updates or patches that address remote_url handling in workflow HTTP request nodes. If you have control over your deployment, you might also try testing with a local file upload (transfer_method=upload) to confirm that only remote_url is affected.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

Please describe.**\nWhen thrown exceptions are tested a typical pattern is to use try/catch with an empty catch block and failing the test with `fail()` when the code under test does not throw the exception.\n\nFor example:\n```\n    try {\n      runtimeService.getVariable(instance.getId(), \"simpleBean\");\n      fail(\"Exception expected.\");\n    }\n    catch(Exception e) {\n      // happy path\n    }\n```\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nOperaton uses AssertJ, which provides a powerful fluent assertion API.\n\nThe replacement for above mentioned code would be:\n```\n    assertThatThrownBy(() -> runtimeService.getVariable(instance.getId(), \"simpleBean\"))\n      .isInstanceOf(Exception.class);\n```\n\nSearch for `fail(\"Exception expected` in the code base for code to refactor. There are more usages of the pattern which is not directly detected because the message differs. Search for usages of the \"fail\" method (either from JUnit 4's `Assert` or JUnit 5's `Assertions`).\n\n**Provide chunked PRs**\nThis is no issue that needs to be solved in one piece. Please provide PRs of overviewable size. Start on any classes you want.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nUsing JUnit 5's `org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions#assertThrows(java.lang.Class<T>, org.junit.jupiter.api.function.Executable)` is a valid alternative when\na) the test class is already migrated to JUnit 5\nb) it is only of interest which type of exception is thrown\n\n\nIt is worth to consider crafting an [OpenRewrite recipe](https://docs.openrewrite.org/authoring-recipes/writing-a-java-refactoring-recipe) for this refactoring.\n\n",

However, as our internal auth configuration on the supabase platform escapes newlines (we use a `.env` file so it helps with security) it's not possible to add multiple newlines as the WebOTP spec at the moment. This is something we're still looking to but might take a while longer to fix - we don't have a fixed date at the moment but will get back when there are updates.\r\n\r\nAppreciate your patience on this - let us know if there are any questions\r\n\r\n", "Can we solve this @J0? It's been a year...

I'm ok with either behavior, but would prefer it to be consistent.\n\n### How can we reproduce the issue?\n\nSelect a transaction, bulk edit note, prepend or append, type anything in. You will notice a space is placed in between the old and new text.\n\nCreate a rule (or just use the rule editor to bulk edit) that prepends or appends to a note, run it, you'll see that no space is added.\n\n### Where are you hosting Actual?\n\nDocker\n\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\n\nChrome, Firefox\n\n### Operating System\n\nWindows 11",

While I don't have a fix yet, we've previously encountered a very similar issue before (https://github.com/kernelwernel/VMAware/issues/359) and all we've done to fix it was by detecting binary translation environments and blacklisting (if found) for those specific techniques, and I'm pretty sure this is the path we'll take but I need to consult with my co-dev (@NotRequiem) who manages these techniques. I assume he's sleeping at the moment, but I'll let him know about the issue.\n\n> You can see in that all hypervisor registers are all zeroes.\n\nThat technique isn't really relevant in this scenario, it's relatively common to have that output.\n\n> I know that a normal hypervisor will return a bendstring when calling CPUID EAX=0x40000000. However, it is a bit strange to see that it is detected as a VM even though it is all 0.\n\nI assume you meant \"brand string\" instead of bendstring, but this is also not surprising since it's a binary translator. I *assume* you have Microsoft PRISM doing the x86 to ARM translation, which isn't really accurate to call it an emulator in itself but that's besides the point.\n\nA lot of funky stuff happens when the binary is being translated to a different ISA, but we still do our best to keep it as compatible as possible with the same core mechanisms we've done for real x86 hardware.

      "description" : "## Feature Description\n\nA Go package that provides a set of utility functions to perform conversions between commonly used units such as bytes, time, and temperature.\n\n---\n\n## Use Case\n\nMany applications require frequent conversions between data sizes (bytes to MB), time units (seconds to hours), and temperature units (Celsius to Fahrenheit). Instead of reimplementing this logic repeatedly, a centralized utility package allows for clean, reusable, and testable conversion functions across different services and applications.\n\n---\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nCreate a new `convert` package. The package will expose clearly named functions to convert:\n\n- Data Sizes: Bytes ??? KB ??? MB ??? GB\n- Time: Seconds ??? Minutes ??? Hours ??? Days\n- Temperature: Celsius ??? Fahrenheit ??? Kelvin\n\nThe package will use constants for unit multipliers where applicable, and follow idiomatic Go function naming.\n\n---\n\n## Additional Context\n\nThis utility package is meant to be lightweight and dependency-free. The logic should avoid third-party libraries and be kept easily testable and benchmarkable. The package can be expanded in the future to support additional categories (e.g., distance, volume, speed).\n\n---\n\n## Pseudo Code\n\n```go\n// Data size conversion functions\nfunc BytesToKB(b int64) float64\nfunc KBToBytes(kb float64) int64\nfunc BytesToMB(b int64) float64\nfunc MBToBytes(mb float64) int64\nfunc BytesToGB(b int64) float64\nfunc GBToBytes(gb float64) int64\n\n// Time conversion functions\nfunc SecondsToMinutes(s int64) int64\nfunc MinutesToSeconds(m int64) int64\nfunc MinutesToHours(m int64) int64\nfunc HoursToMinutes(h int64) int64\nfunc HoursToDays(h int64) int64\nfunc DaysToHours(d int64) int64\n\n// Temperature conversion functions\nfunc CelsiusToFahrenheit(c float64) float64\nfunc FahrenheitToCelsius(f float64) float64\nfunc CelsiusToKelvin(c float64) float64\nfunc KelvinToCelsius(k float64) float64\nfunc FahrenheitToKelvin(f float64) float64\nfunc KelvinToFahrenheit(k float64) float64\n",

Apologies if I have incorrectly replied to your message, it's displaying a little strangely for me.", "Hi all,\r\n\r\nJust came across this issue and decided to do some debugging.\r\n\r\nI was able to reproduce this in the master branch and agree with @ashishkumar468 that this is not related with storage permissions. It actually seems to be related with the app's state restoration.\r\n\r\nWhen permissions are changed while the app is in background, Android terminates the app's process. After doing that, when the user returns to the app, Android tries to recreate the app's state (MainActivity with all it's child Fragments). The same behavior occurs by following these steps:\r\n\r\n1. Launch the app with Android Studio\r\n2. Click any picture in the Explore tab\r\n3. Press the Home button to send the app to background\r\n4. Terminate the app in Android Studio (Logcat)\r\n5. Open the app again\r\n\r\nThis also results in a crash with the same stacktrace.\r\n\r\nGoing deeper I noticed that MediaDetailsFragment was getting the Media object from a provider, but when it's state is restored the provider seems to be missing all it's data, and so the Media object is null. It seems that this provider is not being correctly initialized.\r\n\r\nSince the Media object was being kept in a private variable, and the Media class is Parcelable, I tried to save it in onSaveInstanceState() and retrieve it in onCreateView() to see what happens. I also moved the line where the Media object was being retrieved from the provider (onResume()) to a place where it would not be executed when the state was being restored. This apparently fixed the crash since the Media object is never null but it produced some weird side effects and is not a viable fix.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think?\r\n", "@FivelMttz Are you still working on this? In any case please let us know what is the state of this issue on your side, thanks! :-)", "@marcosliberal @nicolas-raoul Preventing the crash here is very easy. Just by checking `if (media != null)` crash can be prevented. The main problem is the output after this. On resuming, the screen becomes blank with **Toolbar and tabLayout**.", "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI had some time to take a deeper look at this issue and I actually found a couple of state restoration issues on the entire fragment hierarchy that are not only causing the issue reported here but more issues in places like the explore list itself.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if we run the same steps previously stated, but instead of opening a picture before changing the permissions (or using any other method that makes android destroy the app's process) we just stay in the explore list, the app will apparently nicely recover. I say apparently, because if after the app recovers you then open any image, you will see a white screen.\r\n\r\n![20210301_141655](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4533932/109509860-44ee8780-7a99-11eb-8691-04c0cd99dae3.gif)\r\n\r\nSo, I took some time trying to figuring out everything that was being wrongly managed in terms of state restoration related with this issue and I think I got this working.\r\n\r\nSorry for not previously ask you guys if I could work on this issue, but if you want, you can assign it to me and I will very soon share my solution.", "@marcosliberal Looks like you've done significant work on this issue.

      "description" : "### Summary\r\n\r\nWhen app crashes, information about the crash is not available in `Settings` / `Send log file` but it looks like nothing bad happened at all. Instead, crash log should be present in log file kept by the Commons app, so it can be accesses at later time.\r\n\r\n- see https://github.com/commons-app/apps-android-commons/issues/5721 for example about such recent 5.0.1 crash which did not leave in-app logs\r\n- https://github.com/commons-app/apps-android-commons/issues/5387#issuecomment-1837149353 for another (older version report) crash example which did not leave logs\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. provoke an app crash (e.g. using https://github.com/commons-app/apps-android-commons/issues/5721)\r\n2. dismiss `Oops. Something went wrong` dialog (for example, because you cannot attend to it at the time)\r\n3. start app again and go to `Settings` / `Send log file`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nThe internal app log (i.e. `Settings` / `Send log file`) should contain errors that caused app to crash (crash trace log).\r\n\r\n### Actual behaviour\r\n\r\nThe crash errors are not available in the in-app log viewer/sender. \r\n\r\nI had to use external LogCat app [LogFox](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.f0x1d.logfox/) (with complex setup involving USB cable and adb to give it permissions) in order to extract the crash log.\r\n\r\n### Device name\r\n\r\nSamsung Galaxy S23+\r\n\r\n### Android version\r\n\r\nAndroid 14 (OneUI 6.1)\r\n\r\n### Commons app version\r\n\r\n5.0.1~af028cbdd (latest F-droid)\r\n\r\n### Device logs\r\n\r\nThis is present in in-app log viewer, after restarting Commons app and going to `Settings` / `Send log file`, with no information about error/crash:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2024-05-11 22:11:53,763     [DEBUG] [file-logging-thread-1] [ContributionsFragment] : Number of notifications is 1\r\n2024-05-11 22:12:14,685     [DEBUG]

      "description" : "---\n\n### \uD83C\uDF31 Add Cohere LLM Support to Saiki (Registry + SDK + Docs)\n\n#### \uD83E\uDDE9 Summary\nWe want the Web UI (and CLI/REST) to let users pick Cohere models.  \nThis requires:\n1. Extending the TypeScript registry/types ??????  \n2. Wiring the Vercel AI SDK factory so the runtime can actually call Cohere ??????  \n3. Adding a few tiny unit-test ??????  \n4. Updating docs and examples ??????  \n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDD28 What to do (rough step-by-step guide)\n\nThis guide gives the rough steps for implementing this feature (I might have missed something, so feel free to mention if there are other changes here\n\n#### 1. Update the provider type\n```ts\n// src/core/ai/llm/registry.ts\nexport type LLMProvider =\n  | 'openai'\n  | 'anthropic'\n  | 'google'\n  | 'groq'\n  | 'cohere';        // ??? new\n```\n\n#### 2. Insert Cohere entry in `LLM_REGISTRY`\n```ts\nexport const LLM_REGISTRY: Record<LLMProvider, ProviderInfo> = {\n  // ???existing providers\n  cohere: {\n    models: [\n      { name: 'command-r-plus', maxInputTokens: <>, default: true },\n      { name: 'command-r',      maxInputTokens: <> }\n    ],\n    supportedRouters: ['vercel'],   // Cohere uses OpenAI-compatible /v1\n    supportsBaseURL: false\n  },\n};\n```\n*Token limits*: Check cohere docs for the right input tokens numbers. I think it is 128k. also add any other new models you find cool\n\n#### 3. Wire Cohere into the Vercel AI SDK factory\n\n1. **Install dependency**\n   ```bash\n   npm install @ai-sdk/cohere --save\n   ```\n\n2. **Modify LLM service factory**\n   ```ts\n   // src/core/ai/llm/services/factory.ts\n   import { createCohere } from '@ai-sdk/cohere';  // ??? new import\n\n   ...\n\n   switch (provider.toLowerCase()) {\n     case 'openai':      /* existing */\n     case 'anthropic':\n     case 'google':\n     case 'groq':\n       ...\n     case 'cohere':                       // ??? add case\n       return createCohere({ apiKey })(model);\n     default:\n       throw new Error(`Unsupported LLM provider: ${provider}`);\n   }\n   ```\n\n*(A dedicated ???in-built??? Cohere service isn???t required; Vercel routing is enough.)*\n\n#### 4. Add unit tests  \nCreate or update `src/core/ai/llm/registry.test.ts`:\n\n```ts\nimport { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';\nimport {\n  getSupportedProviders,\n  getDefaultModelForProvider,\n  isValidProviderModel\n} from './registry.js';\n\ndescribe('Cohere registry entry', () => {\n  it('is registered as a provider', () => {\n    expect(getSupportedProviders()).toContain('cohere');\n  });\n\n  it('returns a default model', () => {\n    expect(getDefaultModelForProvider('cohere')).toBe('command-r-plus');\n  });\n\n  it('validates model/provider combos', () => {\n    expect(isValidProviderModel('cohere', 'command-r')).toBe(true);\n    expect(isValidProviderModel('cohere', 'non-existent')).toBe(false);\n  });\n});\n```\n\n#### 5. Update docs\n1. **docs/api/types.md** ??? add `'cohere'` to the `provider` union.  \n2. **docs/docs/guides/configuring-saiki/llm/providers.md** ???  \n   ??? Add ???Cohere??? section with snippet and model list.  \n   ??? Append `COHERE_API_KEY` to env-var table.  \n3. **docs/docs/guides/configuring-saiki/llm/configuration.md** ???  \n   ??? Include `cohere` wherever provider lists appear.  \n   ??? Add ???### Cohere Configuration??? example.  \n4. **docs/api/rest/llm.md** ??? expand the `/api/llm/providers` sample JSON to include Cohere.  \n5. Any tutorial or SDK example that lists providers???drop in a Cohere snippet.\n\n*(See `docs/README.md` for running the local docs server.)*\n\n---\n\n### ??? Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] `LLMProvider` union now includes `'cohere'`.\n- [ ] `LLM_REGISTRY` has a well-formed Cohere entry with at least two models and one `default: true`.\n- [ ] Factory code instantiates Cohere via Vercel AI SDK (`createCohere`).\n- [ ] Unit tests pass (`npm test`) and CI stays green.\n- [ ] Running `npm run build` succeeds (type-check + bundling).\n- [ ] Web UI dropdown shows Cohere provider and its models.\n- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect Cohere support.\n- [ ] Manually tested each model\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDCA1 Helpful resources\n* Cohere API docs ??? https://docs.cohere.com  \n* Existing registry/service patterns (`openai`, `google`, etc.) for reference.  \n* Unit-testing utilities: Vitest (`npm test`).  \n* Web UI setup: `src/app/webui/README.md`  \n* Docs server: `docs/README.md`\n\n---",

      "description" : "\n### Being Discussed in https://github.com/Meesho/BharatMLStack/discussions/162\n\n<div type='discussions-op-text'>\n\n<sup>Originally posted by **addloopy** July  5, 2025</sup>\n# RFC00001: Snowflake Feature Pull Connector for BharatMLStack\n\n## Metadata\n- **Author:** Adarsha Das\n- **Date Created:** 2025-07-05\n- **Status:** Draft\n- **Target Release:** v1.1.0\n- **Discussion Channel:** #connectors-snowflake\n\n---\n\n## 1. Summary\nThis proposal introduces native support for **Snowflake** as an offline feature store **and** describes an end-to-end pipeline that ports those features into **BharatMLStack's online feature store** so they can be served for real-time inference. The connector retrieves features from Snowflake using the `snowflake.ml.feature_store` API, applies the transformation/deduplication logic in `data_helpers.py`, then relies on `spark_feature_push_client` to serialize the resulting Spark DataFrame into Protobuf and push it???via Kafka or another configured sink???into the online store. The aim is to provide a single, frictionless path from Snowflake to online serving with zero intermediate exports.\n\n## 2. Motivation\n1. **Industry Adoption** ??? Snowflake is the de-facto cloud data warehouse for many ML teams.\n2. **Unified Governance** ??? Keeping features in Snowflake allows teams to reuse established data contracts, lineage, and RBAC.\n3. **Performance & Scale** ??? Snowflake's automatic scaling matches BharatMLStack's design philosophy of elastic cost.\n4. **Developer Ergonomics** ??? The `snowflake.ml.feature_store` SDK abstracts low-level SQL and improves developer productivity.\n\nWithout this connector, users have to export data to object storage before ingesting it, introducing latency and operational overhead.\n\n## 3. Goals\n- Add **`SNOWFLAKE_TABLE`** as a new `source_type` value consumed by `read_from_source()`.\n- Use the **`snowflake.ml.feature_store.FeatureStore`** abstraction for reading data, not raw JDBC.\n- Support predicate-pushdown on a configurable partition column (default: `ingestion_timestamp`).\n- Preserve existing semantics: the helper must return a Spark DataFrame deduplicated on entity keys.\n- Provide clear configuration & credential management guidelines.\n- Seamlessly push the transformed Snowflake features to BharatMLStack's online feature store through `spark_feature_push_client`, enabling immediate consumption at inference time.\n\n## 4. Non-Goals\n- Online serving from Snowflake (future work).\n- Bi-directional sync or writing features back into Snowflake.\n- Support for Snowflake external tables or stages (out of scope for first version).\n\n## 5. Detailed Design\n\n![Arch](./arch.png)\n### 5.1 Data Pull Flow\n1. **Session Creation** ??? A `snowpark.Session` is established using env-vars or a passed-in config map.\n2. **Feature Store Bind** ??? Instantiate `FeatureStore(session)`.\n3. **Table Selection** ??? Retrieve the maximum value of the partition column via the Feature Store API.\n4. **Data Retrieval** ??? Load the filtered rows into a Spark DataFrame through `feature_store.read().to_spark()`.\n5. **Schema Alignment** ??? Column names are normalized and optionally renamed according to `feature_mapping`.\n\n### 5.2 Data Push Flow\n1. **Null Handling & Default Filling** ??? Invoke `fill_na_features_with_default_values` to replace missing values based on feature metadata.\n2. **Proto Generation** ??? Use `OnlineFeatureStorePyClient.generate_df_with_protobuf_messages` (from `spark_feature_push_client`) to convert rows into Protobuf messages.\n3. **Batching & Kafka Write** ??? Call `write_protobuf_df_to_kafka`, optionally in batches, to stream messages to the online feature-store ingress topic.\n4. **Audit Sink (Optional)** ??? If `features_write_to_cloud_storage` is `true`, persist the transformed DataFrame to the configured cloud path for replay or debugging.\n5. **Online Availability** ??? Once consumed by BharatMLStack's ingestion service, features become queryable for real-time inference within SLA (p95 < X s).\n\n### 5.3 API Touch-Points\n| Function | Change | Rationale |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `read_from_source()` | Add `elif source_type == \"SNOWFLAKE_TABLE\"` branch to perform steps in 5.1 | Aligns with existing connector pattern |\n| `src_type_to_partition_col_map` | Append `\"SNOWFLAKE_TABLE\": \"ingestion_timestamp\"` | Ensures incremental loads |\n\n### 5.4 Configuration\n| Parameter | Description | Example |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT` | Snowflake account identifier | `xy12345.us-east-1` |\n| `SNOWFLAKE_USER` | Login user | `ml_readonly` |\n| `SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD` | Password or OAuth token | `****` |\n| `SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE` | Virtual warehouse used for queries | `ML_WH` |\n| `SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE` | Database containing feature tables | `FEATURE_DB` |\n| `SNOWFLAKE_SCHEMA` | Default schema | `PUBLIC` |\n\nCredentials are loaded by helper utilities and injected into the Snowpark session. Users may override through function arguments for multi-account scenarios.\n\n### 5.5 Error Handling & Observability\n- **Retry Logic:** Exponential backoff for transient Snowflake errors (`XYZ-0001`, `XYZ-0002`).\n- **Metrics:**\n  - `snowflake.connector.latency_ms`\n  - `snowflake.connector.rows_read`\n  - `snowflake.connector.bytes_scanned`\n- **Logging:** Obfuscate sensitive parameters before logging connection strings.\n\n## 6. Test Plan\n1. **Unit Tests** ??? Mock `snowflake.ml.feature_store` to simulate data fetches.\n2. **Integration Tests** ??? Use Snowflake's `TPCH_SF1` sample to validate partition filtering, column renaming, null-handling, Protobuf generation, and successful push to the online feature store.\n3. **Schema Drift Tests** ??? Verify connector surface errors when expected columns are missing or types change.\n\n## 7. Rollout Strategy\n| Phase | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Alpha | Flag-guarded release for internal users. Collect feedback. |\n| Beta | Publicly documented. Backwards compatibility guaranteed. |\n| GA | Remove feature flag. Add SLA monitoring. |\n\n## 8. Alternatives Considered\n- **Spark JDBC Connector** ??? Simpler, but lacks feature-store metadata awareness and type mapping.\n- **Materializing Views to Parquet** ??? Adds latency and duplication of storage.\n\n## 9. Risks & Mitigations\n| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Snowflake API instability | Ingest failures | Pin to major version; add compatibility tests |\n| Credential leakage | Security breach | Use secrets manager integration; no plaintext logs |\n| Large data pulls | Cost overruns | Enforce partition filters; sample row counts during CI |\n\n## 10. Success Metrics\n- 100% schema parity with Snowflake source tables.\n\n## 11. Future Work\n- Automatic statistics push to BharatML observability dashboard.\n\n## 12. References\n- Snowflake ML Feature Store Documentation (2024-04) ??? *\"snowflake.ml.feature_store\"*.\n\n[RFC PR](https://github.com/Meesho/BharatMLStack/pull/161)\n![arch](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d527abe-e690-4d23-b47b-7036eb482d49)\n</div>",

Some pages in the Launchpad manual have broken internal links because they have been recently migrated from another site and are yet to be correctly linked to each other. Launchpad's docs are now hosted on Read the Docs and are written in restructured text or markdown. When linking these docs, it is recommended that the [:ref: method](https://canonical-starter-pack.readthedocs-hosted.com/latest/reference/style-guide/#internal-references) described in the style guide be used. Using :ref: instead of a file path makes it less likely that the link will break if a file is renamed or moved to a different folder.\n\nTask\n-------\nThe pages linked below have one or more broken internal links. Direct the links to the correct pages within the docs using the :ref: method mentioned above. You may need to add a target to a file you're linking to if one is not already present.\n\n[git-hosting](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/launchpad/en/latest/user/explanation/working-with-code/git-hosting/) \n[message-rationale-headers](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/launchpad/en/latest/user/explanation/message-rationale-headers/)",

      "description" : "### Feature Description\n\nAs a user, I want the shortcut for moving events to the sidebar be consistent with the shortcuts for moving events between the sidebar, so that I don't have to memorize more shortcuts.\n\nIn other words, the shortcut to move a timed event (grid or all-day) to the sidebar should be `CTRL + [META] + [LEFT/RIGHT ARROW]. \n\n----\n\nWe currently have this working for the `[META] + SHIFT + ,` shortcut. Practically, in this issue we just need to change the shortcut to be `[META] + SHIFT + [LEFT ARROW]`.\n\n<img width=\"836\" height=\"794\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3aedd1f-a6df-4b06-bfc3-b5cac21c3f07\" />\n\n\n### Use Case\n\nWe're already using the `CTRL + [META]` prefix to move someday events\n- `CTRL + [META] + [RIGHT]` when a This Week event is open moves the event to the next week\n- `CTRL + [META] + [DOWN]` when a This Week event is open moves the event to the This Month section\n\nKeeping this same pattern for regular events feels intuitive. Users will hopefully internalize the idea that whenever they want to change an event's location, they just need to type `CTRL + [META]` and then play arrow with the arrows. \n\n### Additional Context\n\nIn the future, we're planning to experiment with allowing the users to reschedule events entirely with the keyboard. For example, they'd go from a sidebar event to the grid and then to the correct time without ever touching the mouse. Having a consistent shortcut experience is important for that workflow to work, so doing this now will pay dividends later.",

We can replace this popup with a full page that we already use as confirmation.**\n\n**Your task will be to check that all the issues have been correctly developed, that the components are properly arranged, and that everything matches exactly as in the Figma design:**\n\nhttps://www.figma.com/design/S1UKYgWewNqNHZFAaBUilG/%F0%9F%8F%9D%EF%B8%8F-Starknet-ID?node-id=7022-31922&t=XCt8XQUo4vZRtmIv-1\n\n### Purpose of the Issue\nThe goal of this issue is to finalize the redesign of the confirmation page that appears after activating a subscription on the Starknet ID platform. The current popup will be replaced with a full confirmation page, ensuring all components are properly developed and aligned with the Figma design.\n\n- **Alignment with Figma Design**:\n  - Check that all components are correctly arranged and match exactly as shown in the Figma file linked in the issue description.\n\n### Actions to Take\n1. **Review Sub-Issues**:\n   - Verify that each sub-issue (#1110???#1114) has been implemented according to specifications.\n   \n2. **Testing**:\n   - Test all functionalities locally, including navigation, button redirects, and visual alignment.\n   \n3. **Final Adjustments**:\n   - Ensure consistency across all elements (images, text, buttons) and fix any discrepancies between the implementation and the Figma design.\n\n4. **Commit and Submit**:\n   - Create a final commit summarizing changes (e.g., `git commit -m \"Final review: confirmation page redesign\"`).\n   - Submit a pull request for review and approval.\n\n### Constraints\n- All components must strictly follow the Figma design.\n- Testing should cover both functionality and visual accuracy.\n- This issue serves as a final review, so attention to detail is critical.\n\n\n## Proposed Actions \uD83D\uDEE0???\n\nHere???s a checklist of actions to follow for resolving this issue:\n\n1. **Fork and Create Branch**:  \n   Fork the repository and create a new branch using the issue number:\n   ```bash\n   git checkout -b fix-[issue-number]\n   ```\n\n2. **Implement Changes**:  \n\t[Insert Code snippet if needed with a mardown todo list]\n\n3. **Run Tests and Commit Changes**:  \n   Make sure your changes don't break existing functionality and commit with a clear message:\n   ```bash\n   git commit -m \"Fix: [Short description of the fix]\"\n   ```\n\n## Required \uD83D\uDCCB\n\nTo keep our workflow smooth, please make sure you follow these guidelines:\n\n- **Assignment**: Don't create a pull request if you weren???t assigned to this issue.\n- **Timeframe**: Complete the task within **3 business days**.\n- **Closing the Issue**: In your PR description, close the issue by writing `Close #[issue_id]`.\n- **Review Process**:\n  - Once you've submitted your PR, change the label to **\"ready for review\"**.\n  - If changes are requested, address them and then update the label back to **\"ready for review\"** once done.\n- **Testing**: Test your PR locally before pushing, and verify that tests and build are working after pushing.\n\nThank you for your contribution \uD83D\uDE4F\n\n??????

Although my kubernes IngressClass is configured as default (there is only one Ingress in my setup) and I also set it to watch for Ingress deployments without an IngressClass, the jaeger Ingress always has an IngressClass of '<none>'. \r\n\r\nWhen I delete the Ingress and recreate it, it has the default IngressClass 'nginx'. But after a while, it is overwritten with '<none>' again. Happens only with jaeger . Other, manually created Ingresses, work just fine!\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Prepare a kubernetes Cluster. Mine runs 1.27\r\n2. Install Ingress, like so:  \r\n```\r\n    helm repo add ingress-nginx https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx\r\n    helm repo update\r\n    helm upgrade --install  ingress-nginx ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx  --set watchIngressWithoutClass=true --set controller.ingressClassResource.default=true --namespace ingress-nginx --create-namespace\r\n```\r\n3. Install Jaeger, follow the documentation at https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.18/operator/. The 'AllInOne' Setup should be fine, though I use the production strategey.\r\n4. Check the jaeger-query is there. It should have an IngressClass of 'nginx'.\r\n5. Wait an hour or so....check again. Now it should how an IngressClass of '<none>'.\r\n6. Save the Ingress to to a yaml file: `kubectl get ingress jaeger-query -o yaml > /tmp/ingerss.yaml`\r\n7. Create the Ingress again: `kubectl replace -f /tmp/ingress.yaml --force`\r\n8. Repeat Steps 4 and 5\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nIngress jaeger-query should always have a default IngressClass 'nginx'.\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### Screenshot\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Jaeger backend version\n\nv1.44.0\n\n### SDK\n\n_No response_\n\n### Pipeline\n\n_No response_\n\n### Stogage backend\n\nOpen-Search\n\n### Operating system\n\nLinux, Debian 11\n\n### Deployment model\n\nKubernetes\n\n### Deployment configs\n\n_No response_",

I'm not sure what behavior clangd follows if there are different compile_flags.txt in subdirectories, but that could be a possible solution.\r\n\r\nThere's also the possibility of making a tool that generates compile_commands.json by traversing the specified source directories and creating entries with the proper arm7/arm9 flags, although something like [bear](https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear) could just be used instead (I've found it to be a bit finicky though).\r\n", "Personally, I just went for implementing `-MJ` in GCC; it's convenient but, again, this makes it incompatible with non-Wonderful toolchains, as it's a non-upstreamed patch." ],

So now to fix the bug it is required that we exclude the transitive Bouncy Castle 1.69 version and explicitly add the latest stable release, which is currently 1.81 (as of July 2025).\n\nHowever, this change introduces some maintenance overhead, as we now need to manually manage the version compatibility with any updates in com.vesoft:client. Please let me know if you're okay with proceeding with this approach.\n\nFor your reference adding the link for current Bouncy Castle version used by Vespa Client: Maven Central: https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.vesoft/client\n\nLet me know your thoughts on this. I'm happy to proceed with the change if we agree on the direction.\n", "hi @MadhuriRathod30 \uD83D\uDC4D I find the `com.vesoft:client` is introduced by `hertzbeat-collector/hertzbeat-collector-nebulagraph` `pom`.

There are other CVEs associated with their okhttp dependency etc.\nThey have also gone and chosen dependencies to maximise inconvenience to their users.\n" ],

I think that it is because [calls](https://github.com/redis/rueidis/blob/a6631b384d3aad52768c403e1a12ca590acdc6f5/pipe.go#L970) to add items to the ring buffer will block if there is no free slot. The response time is essentially unbounded in this scenario, and this causes problems for clients that really need to fail fast if they're not getting responses in an adequate amount of time.\n\nI'm wondering if you seen this come up in practice and put any thought it how to fix? I don't see an easy way to fix this given that the request goroutine will [wait](https://github.com/redis/rueidis/blob/main/ring.go#L60) on the conditional variable if the slot is full.

I think the scenario is rare in practice, but it can happen if Redis malfunctions and the client continues to send requests without receiving responses. Then, after 1 second, the connection will be killed by the `backgroundPing` goroutine since there is no `PONG` response.\n\nAs you pointed out, the request goroutine will [wait](https://github.com/redis/rueidis/blob/main/ring.go#L60) on the conditional variable if the slot is full. So I think a fix should be replacing the conditional variable with an implementation that can respect context. We probably need to reimplement the conditional variable with channels.", "Context should be respected.\n\nBut as @rueian said, the scenario is rare. Would [monitoring ring buffer](https://github.com/redis/rueidis/discussions/537) needed to? ", "Hi @proost, thanks for bringing back the proposal. I still have no idea what metrics we should track; however, we actually have a wrCounter counter already that is pretty close to what you described in the proposal.\n\nhttps://github.com/redis/rueidis/blob/968b315f62e3d5fa20a5be94247c0e374091d373/pipe.go#L86", "Starting monitor `wrCounter` looks good to me.\n\nBecause `wrCounter` tells how many commands are waiting.

Currently, this is NOT aware of the difference of BibTeX and BibLaTeX.\n\n??? This is a good excercise to learn test-driven development and using a data model. This issue cannot be solved with an AI. You really have to think though BibTeX and BibLaTeX for yourself! Take this issue only if you are willing to invest significant time. ???\n\nExample: \n\n```bibtex\n@online{withDate,\n  date = {2025},\n  urldate = {2025-07-05}\n}\n\n@online{withoutDate,\n  urldate = {2025-07-05}\n}\n```\n\nIn BibTeX: Only `withDate`, field: `date` should be reported, because both entries take `urldate`.\n\nIn BibLaTeX: Only `withoutDate`, field: `date` (missing) should be reported, because required field `date` is missing.\n\n## Task\n\n- Modify `org.jabref.logic.quality.consistency.BibliographyConsistencyCheck` to use a complete `BibDatabaseContext` instead of a list of entries\n- Modify `org.jabref.logic.quality.consistency.BibliographyConsistencyCheck#check` to adhere the mode\n\n## Hints\n\n- Required fields of BibLaTeX `@online`: `org.jabref.model.entry.types.BiblatexEntryTypeDefinitions#ONLINE`\n- Get used to `org.jabref.model.entry.types.BibtexEntryTypeDefinitions` and `org.jabref.model.entry.types.BiblatexEntryTypeDefinitions`\n- One can get the required fields using `org.jabref.model.entry.BibEntryType#getRequiredFields`\n- Do test-driven development. Start with enabling `org.jabref.logic.quality.consistency.BibliographyConsistencyCheckTest#unsetFieldsReported` again.\n- Do not get confused with \"library\" and \"database\". User-facing we talk about \"library\", inside the code, we use \"database\", but mean \"library\".\n",

      "comments" : [ "Ah I see. I was not aware people manually numbered them. The use case you are describing is valid. Will have to add some logic to allow for the custom numbering. Thanks for bringing this to my attention and clear description!", "Thank you for follow-up. I guess the fundamental issue here is what we are expecting from `axes.number`. Do we always expect `axes.number` from 1 to the number of axes? Part of the reason for the bug #166 is because when slicing axes, we cannot expect axes.number to start from 1. \n\nDo we expect the user to arbitrarily assign this value? Is it in the scope of ultraplot to allow user to do a partial figure (which does not start from sub-figure `A`)?", "Yeah I was thinking about this too. \n\nI wrongly assumed that the format is always intended to be used in a sequential order, and we can fool the formatting if we don't provide all the inputs by either resetting the number of imputing values to none or empty strings. However, this approach would fail for abc as it specifically uses the axis number to index into the alphabet. \n\nAs you pointed out this can be considered as a bug or a feature -- leaning more towards a bug. I am just not too sure how often one constructs figures in the manner your provided. I heavily lean on `subplots` and never manually label the axes, but that does not mean that others expect this feature. I will need to do some thinking about whether to revert the fix for #166  or there is a way to have both. Slicing the axes in a way would perhaps be better than what I introduced in by fixing #166.\n\n", "I agree that this issue is linked to one???s coding style. If we assume that `abc` only occurs during the final production stage, then there are large chances that users use a chain of code from subplot A to N one by one.\n\n\nHowever, figures are becoming complicated. It is common now that subplots are combined from multiple sources, which means subplots may rely on different datasets. If in this case users wish to plot everything in one figure with ultraplot, then they need to load all relevant data in one script. I guess sometimes we may just wish to plot several separate panels of subplots and manually combine them later. I am not sure whether this is a reasonable demand...?\n\n\nI feel treating \"manual manipulation abc label??? as a feature would be easier. Maybe.", "There are a few options I see\n\n- use slicing as a replacement for the current lazy evaluation where the ordering is assumed. This would replace the current lazy evaluation\n- allow dicts to be passed to only update certain numbers \n- add keyword to set abc offset\n\nFor the last one it could be an offset, i.e. you want to plot specifically from \"D\" or from \"Z\" or whatever. All three would potentially be the most flexible, but necessitates a partial reversal.", "Actually the fourth would just be to pass options, but then the difference with mere titles is not that much", "For the offset one, there will be an assumption that user always want a sequence of `abc` with an increment of 1. If users should be allowed to arbitrarily set `abc` label, then this is just a partial implementation instead of a full solution. One possible scenario is to just plot the rightmost column in a 2x3 figure, which has labels of \"C\" \"F\".\n\nIs it a good thing to decouple `abc` label with `axes.number`? \n\n- When not specified, infer `abc` labels from `axes.number`. \n- If users give `sequence`, then map the sequence like what `title` do in #166;\n- if give `dicts`, then do the replacement.\n\n\nAlso, one related issue: I am also confused on the documentation of `abc` in API (like [this one]( https://ultraplot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/ultraplot.figure.Figure.html#:~:text=abc)). It says `abc` key accepts `sequence` but not clear on how `sequence` is interpreted.", "Yes, I think we thinking along similar lines. However, the issue is that #166 does this in a particular way by overriding the `number` property to satisfy the length check. For example the `abc` parameter is inferred as:\n\n```python\n            if self.number > len(abc):\n                raise ValueError(\n                    f\"Invalid abc list length {len(abc)} \"\n                    f\"for axes with number {self.number}.\"\n                )\n            else:\n                kw[\"text\"] = abc[self._number - 1]\n```\n\nTo get around the first check, I merely overrode the number property temporarily.  For `abc` this is not an issue issue. For `title` this happens in a similar fashion. For example, the code you provided would fail for setting title if we remove the overwriting of the number because it will attempt to look up based on the index. The relevant code for update is\n\n```python\n            if self.number is None:\n                pass\n            elif self.number > len(title):\n                raise ValueError(\n                    f\"Invalid title list length {len(title)} \"\n                    f\"for axes with number {self.number}.\"\n                )\n            else:\n                kw[\"text\"] = title[self.number - 1]\n```\n\nThe codebase, therefore, assumes that the arrays that are being set are linear, and the user does not have custom numbers. But that doesn't solve your issue. You could provide a sequence like this\n\n```python\n\nfig = uplt.figure(figwidth=3, figheight=2)\nax1 = fig.add_subplot(131, number=2, abc=True)\nax2 = fig.add_subplot(132, number=4, abc=True)\nax3 = fig.add_subplot(133, number=6, abc=True)\n\naxs = fig.subplotgrid\naxs.format(abc=[\"d\", \"e\", \"f\"])\n```\nwhich would generate\n\n<img width=\"599\" height=\"396\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7efa06a-0f07-40ff-8b86-be6275b580d9\" />\n\nAn abc offset would allow you to do this in an \"automatic\" fashion without having to specify this -- but as you said then it would still be linear." ],

Expanding this feature and making it more robust would really complement those improvements.\n\n\n",

Comment on this issue before starting work so it can be assigned to you. Also, this issue may have been filed with limited detail or changes may have occurred that are worth sharing with you before you start work.\n 2. Drop by our [community chat](https://owncast.rocket.chat/) if you'd like to be involved in more real-time discussion around Owncast to talk about this change.\n 3. Follow the project's getting started tips to make sure you can [build and run the project from source](https://owncast.online/development).\n\n ### Notes\n\n - Development takes place on the `develop` branch.\n - We use Storybook for testing and developing React components. `npm run storybook`. A hosted version [is available for viewing](https://owncast.online/components).\n - If you need to install the Go programming language to run the Owncast backend it's simple from [here](https://go.dev/dl/).\n - Active contributors get an Owncast t-shirt! Ask about it if you feel like you've been contributing and haven't yet been given one.\n\n ### New to Git?\n\n If you're brand new to Git you may want a short primer about the Fork -> Commit -> Pull Request workflow that enables changes to get made collaboratively using git.

Most changes have been made by re-setting the default values of certain ``rcParams``.\r\n\r\nOne of the requirements is the left-alignment of titles of graphs. For the axis title I can set ``rcParams['axes.titlelocation']`` to ``'left'``, as itdefaults to ``center``. I would like to do something similar to the figure's suptitle.\r\n\r\nCurrently, setting the figure's suptitle only takes defaults ``rcParams['figure.titlesize']`` and ``rcParams['figure.titleweight']``. The other parameters for location and alignment of the suptitle are defaulted in the method's argument definition. My desire is to add these to ``rcParams`` as well, and refer hereto as default.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nE.g. expand the ``rcParams`` with:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    'figure.titleloc_x': 0.5,\r\n    'figure.titleloc_y': 0.98,\r\n    'figure.titleha': 'center',\r\n    'figure.titleva': 'center'\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then use these defaults in ``figure.suptitle()``, very similar to how ``rcParams['figure.titlesize']`` and ``rcParams['figure.titleweight']`` are already used as default values.",

", "I think this is a good first issue because there is limited API choices to be made and there are good examples of merged PRs adding rcparams to follow, but medium because there are a bunch of moving parts that will need to be done:\r\n\r\n - add the validators for the rcaparms\r\n - add the values to the default matplotlibrc\r\n - add tests that changing the rcparams works and overridding it at call time works\r\n - add a \"whats new\"\r\n - maybe add an example or extend an existing example to make use of the new rcparams\r\n\r\n@jklymak could you comment on why this would conflict with constrained layout?  If we can already control these things through kwargs I would not expect making them controllable via rcparam to cause any (new) problems.", "Note that docstrings are autogenerated via a common template for `suptitle`, `supxlabel`, `supylabel` and parameter defaults are substituted. This would need adption to include the rcParams for suptitle, which will be a bit fiddly.\r\n\r\nNaming: I propose to use `figure.title_horizontalalignment` instead of `figure.titleha`. We should not be using abbreviations for the rcParams. While most of the names do not include underscores `figure.titlehorizontalalignment` seems too unreadable, and we have precedence for underscores, e.g. in `legend.title_fontsize`.", "If the scope is as explained by @tacaswell 's comment, I would like to take this up.

Is there any other example I can refer to?", "As @oscargus mentioned, doing it for `supx/ylabel` makes it much easier to implement and that should also take care of the docstrings if I understand right? Since then we won't have to have different things for `suptitle` and `supx/ylabel`. So should I work on having it for all three or do we want to do it just for the title?", "Sorry there is no issue with constrained layout.  The issue is with aligning the x/ylabels and the title.  We need a sentinel for \"default location\" which has historically been the default location.  Then we allow ourselves to move the label to avoid any ticks or other inner decorations.  For xlabel and title this only affects the y and for glabelle this only affects the x.  \n\nIf the user sets the y value for the title to something other than the default, we respect that value and don't try to adjust. \n\nIf we make these things have rcparams do we respect the values passed or do we assume the user still wants the automatic shifting of the title if the y value is equal to their rcparam default?", "~Thanks, @jklymak ! I think I understand what you mean. But in that case, if the user is asking to use a constrained layout, doesn't that by itself imply that they're fine with the locations changing to achieve the constrained layout? In my mind, this is similar to `layout=\"constrained\"` having the highest priority, followed by the value passed as an argument, with rcparam value being the least priority but default.~", "My comment has nothing to do with constrained_layout, but rather to do with the automatic placement of the labels.  ", "Ohh my bad. Sorry. In that case, I think the set rcparam value comes with the understanding that automatic placement still happens to make the figure clear. I don't think that would be something undesirable by the user. ", "> I was taking a look at this PR. Is there any other example I can refer to?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/22566 added another set of rcparams for suptitle/supxlabel/supylabel so it may be worth checking, especially how to get the docs to generate correctly. Which is also why I claimed that it may be easier to add something similar to supxlabel and supylabel as well, although not sure that one would like to have the same alignment for both (`figure.xlabel_horizontalalignment` etc ?).", "Is it issue still open can i work on this" ],

Please describe.**\nThe script currently does not fetch any menstrual data\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nFetching the menstrual data will help female users track their menstrual health and mood\n\n**Additional context**\n\n- The developer @arpanghosh8453, being a male, do not have access to this data. But implementing this will require the JSON output from a few endpoints - so that they can be parsed accordingly and populated in the database. If you are a female and have some familiarity in python, willing to help the project (and other female users of this project), please check out the [python-garminconnect](https://github.com/cyberjunky/python-garminconnect) project and provide results (raw JSON outputs) from the following endpoints :\n\n```python\napi.get_menstrual_data_for_date(\"YYYY-MM-DD\")\n# and \napi.get_menstrual_calendar_data(\"YYYY-MM-DD\", \"YYYY-MM-DD\") # the two dates should be a week or month apart\n```\n\nThank you.

I'm pretty sure there's no difference between `Regular` and `Irregular` modes, as it still offers future cycle predictions in `Irregular` mode and the JSON output looks the same other than `cycleType` being `IRREGULAR`. You can also select if you're on hormonal contraception which turns off fertile window tracking which removes the `fertileWindowStart` and `lengthOfFertileWindow` variables.\n\nI then noticed the `dayLog` variable was `None`, so I went back and selected options for all the possible values in the symptoms tracking section & added a note to the day\n\n`garmin.get_menstrual_data_for_date(\"2025-04-27\")`\n```\n{'daySummary': {'startDate': '2025-04-27', 'dayInCycle': 1, 'periodLength': 6, 'currentPhase': 1, 'lengthOfCurrentPhase': 6, 'daysUntilNextPhase': 6, 'fertileWindowStart': 14, 'lengthOfFertileWindow': 7, 'predictedCycleLength': 31, 'educationContentMod': 7, 'cycleType': 'REGULAR', 'predictedCycle': False}, 'dayLog': {'userProfilePk': 67794428, 'calendarDate': '2025-04-27', 'symptoms': ['ACNE'], 'moods': ['HAPPY'], 'discharge': ['NO_DISCHARGE'], 'flow': 'MEDIUM', 'sexDrive': 'LOW', 'sexualActivity': 'PROTECTED', 'notes': 'Example note', 'reportTimestamp': '2025-05-12T08:35:13.676', 'hasBabyMovement': False, 'ovulationDay': False}}\n```\n\nI then looked at a different day in the cycle and selected the `Ovulation Day` option:\n\n`garmin.get_menstrual_data_for_date(\"2025-05-12\")`\n```\n{'daySummary': {'startDate': '2025-04-27', 'dayInCycle': 16, 'periodLength': 6, 'currentPhase': 3, 'lengthOfCurrentPhase': 7, 'daysUntilNextPhase': 3, 'fertileWindowStart': 12, 'lengthOfFertileWindow': 7, 'predictedCycleLength': 29, 'educationContentMod': 7, 'cycleType': 'REGULAR', 'predictedCycle': False}, 'dayLog': {'userProfilePk': 67794428, 'calendarDate': '2025-05-12', 'symptoms': None, 'moods': None, 'discharge': None, 'flow': None, 'sexDrive': None, 'sexualActivity': None, 'notes': None, 'reportTimestamp': '2025-05-12T08:38:09.432', 'hasBabyMovement': False, 'ovulationDay': True}}\n```\n\nHere's `garmin.get_menstrual_calendar_data(\"2025-04-28\", \"2025-05-27\")`\n```\n{'cycleSummaries': [{'startDate': '2025-04-27', 'periodLength': 6, 'fertileWindowStart': 12, 'lengthOfFertileWindow': 7, 'educationContentMod': 7, 'predictedCycle': False}, {'startDate': '2025-05-26', 'periodLength': 6, 'fertileWindowStart': 14, 'lengthOfFertileWindow': 7, 'educationContentMod': 8, 'predictedCycle': True}], 'loggedSymptomDays': ['2025-04-27'], 'loggedOvulationDays': ['2025-05-12'], 'loggedNoteDays': ['2025-04-27']}\n```\n\nI also switched over to the `Pregnancy Tracking` mode as I image that had some different fields:\n`garmin.get_menstrual_data_for_date(\"2025-05-12\")`\n```\n{'daySummary': {'startDate': '2025-04-08', 'dayInCycle': 35, 'currentPhase': 5, 'lengthOfCurrentPhase': 91, 'daysUntilNextPhase': 57, 'predictedCycleLength': 280, 'educationContentMod': 7, 'pregnancyCycle': True, 'numberOfWeek': 5, 'dueDate': '2026-01-12', 'cycleType': 'PREGNANT', 'predictedCycle': False}, 'dayLog': {'userProfilePk': 67794428, 'calendarDate': '2025-05-12', 'symptoms': ['CRAVINGS', 'NAUSEA'], 'moods': ['FINE'], 'discharge': ['NO_DISCHARGE'], 'flow': None, 'sexDrive': 'AVERAGE', 'sexualActivity': 'UNPROTECTED', 'notes': 'note', 'reportTimestamp': '2025-05-12T08:52:47.645', 'babyMovements': [{'startTimestamp': '2025-05-12T08:51:00.0', 'duration': 3600, 'count': 10, 'movementType': 'KICKS'}, {'startTimestamp': '2025-05-12T09:50:00.0', 'duration': 60, 'count': 10, 'movementType': 'HICCUPS'}, {'startTimestamp': '2025-05-12T09:44:00.0', 'duration': 300, 'count': 3, 'movementType': 'GENERAL'}], 'hasGlucoseLog': True, 'hasBabyMovement': True, 'ovulationDay': False}, 'weightGoals': {'weekNum': 5, 'lowWeightGoalInGrams': 75024.64823869873, 'highWeightGoalInGrams': 75570.10278415326}}\n```\nNote that I did fill out the blood glucose log, but that data does not appear in this JSON response so I presume that is a different endpoint?\n\nHere's the output for `garmin.get_menstrual_calendar_data(\"2025-04-28\", \"2025-05-27\")` when in `Pregnancy Mode`\n```\n{'cycleSummaries': [{'startDate': '2025-04-08', 'educationContentMod': 7, 'pregnancyCycle': True, 'dueDate': '2026-01-12', 'predictedCycle': False}], 'loggedSymptomDays': ['2025-05-12'], 'loggedOvulationDays': [], 'loggedNoteDays': ['2025-05-12']}\n```\n\nIf you select `No Period` mode, this is what you get for `garmin.get_menstrual_data_for_date(\"2025-05-12\")`\n```\n{'daySummary': None, 'dayLog': {'userProfilePk': 67794428, 'calendarDate': '2025-05-12', 'symptoms': ['ACNE'], 'moods': None, 'discharge': None, 'flow': None, 'sexDrive': None, 'sexualActivity': None, 'notes': None, 'reportTimestamp': '2025-05-12T08:59:02.800', 'hasBabyMovement': False, 'ovulationDay': False}}\n```\n\nLet me know if you need any further data \uD83D\uDE42", "Hello @louise-davies, Thank you so much for providing the outputs! There seems to be a lot of variation depending on settings! I need to go through the responses when I have enough free time and come up with an idea to implement this, which would collect all the data, but won't break if there is anything missing. I need to structure it in a way in the database so that it can be visualized on Grafana easily. \n\nIt's amazing to see you have spent so much time tweaking around to report it here - providing a very comprehensive overview. Thanks again! " ],

The core logic for assembling the answer changed in recent updates, specifically in the `_run` method of `answer_node.py`, which now processes and merges template/user text and LLM output differently. This likely causes the LLM output to appear outside your custom tags, leaving the tag empty instead of wrapping the LLM output as before [[source]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/blob/37e19de7ab3d8c1ffd8dfd8b789ff52b47f981cb/api/core/workflow/nodes/answer/answer_node.py).\n\nThere???s no documentation or open issue directly tracking this, but similar regressions have happened before when output formatting or merging logic was refactored. If you need a workaround, try adjusting your template or node configuration to see if you can force the LLM output inside the tag, or temporarily revert to 1.4.3 if that???s feasible for your deployment. If you???re using structured output, double-check your schema and model compatibility, as recent changes in structured output handling have also caused related issues for some users [[source]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/20975).\n\nIf you need to track this for a future fix, keep an eye on changes to `answer_node.py` and related workflow node logic in upcoming releases.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

It seems that changed part only add a wrapper \"ArrayFileSegment\" of return files. I doubt if this will change the answer of my custom tag.", "<!-- Answer -->\nYou're correct???adding the ArrayFileSegment wrapper only affects how file outputs are handled and does not impact string outputs or the formatting of your custom tags in the answer node. The regression with your custom tag is more likely due to changes in how the answer node parses and merges templates and variables. Specifically, the answer is now assembled by splitting your template into text and variable chunks, then merging them, which can cause issues if the chunk boundaries don't align with your tags (for example, if you have a template like `<tag>{{#llm#}}</tag>`)??[[source]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/blob/37e19de7ab3d8c1ffd8dfd8b789ff52b47f981cb/api/core/workflow/nodes/answer/answer_stream_generate_router.py).\n\nIf your tags are ending up empty, it's likely because the variable replacement logic is splitting the template in a way that separates the tag from the variable. This is unrelated to ArrayFileSegment and is instead a subtle change in the template parsing or merging logic. You might be able to work around this by adjusting your template so that the variable is not directly inside the tag, or by experimenting with different placements of your tags and variables. If you need to dig deeper, reviewing the logic in AnswerStreamGeneratorRouter and the template parsers (PromptTemplateParser, VariableTemplateParser) will show exactly how the chunks are split and merged.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

The frontend now uses a custom Rehype plugin that strips or alters any HTML tag that doesn't match the regex /^[a-z][a-z0-9]*$/i, converting it to plain text. This means custom tags (like `<tag>`) are no longer rendered as HTML elements, which is why your LLM output appears outside the tag or the tag appears empty in the UI, even though the backend (and debug panel) output is correct. This stricter sanitation was likely added for security reasons and is not documented as a breaking change, so it may not have been present or as strict in 1.4.3??[reference](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/blob/37e19de7ab3d8c1ffd8dfd8b789ff52b47f981cb/web/app/components/base/markdown/index.tsx).\n\nTo work around this, you can use only standard HTML tags supported by the renderer, or adjust your template to avoid custom tags. If you need custom tag support, you would need to patch the frontend markdown renderer to relax or remove this restriction.

I want to contribute.", "i want to contribute, may someone guide me bit of the process in it", "@Pranjal-231003 The issue here is that some algorithms have multiple implementations, and these implementations are often scattered across multiple files. Sometimes these files will have very different names or will be scattered across multiple directories. This is a problem because it makes it harder for users to compare implementations and harder for contributors to figure out whether an algorithm is in the repo or not. We want to put different implementations of the same algorithm into a single file so that it's all in one place.\r\n\r\nFor example, this repo used to have `factorial_recursive.py` and `factorial_iterative.py`. We combined them into a single file `factorial.py`, and this file contains both the recursive implementation and the iterative implementation. This is the work that we're asking contributors to do for this issue.\r\n\r\nIf you want to contribute to solving this issue, look around the codebase and find an algorithm that's implemented by multiple files. Choose one of those files to keep, and copy the code from the other files into this main file. You may need to rename the file or rename some functions when you do this.

Here are some possible methods:\r\n\r\nUse module import:\r\nIn Python, different algorithms can be imported in the form of modules. Create a main file (such as main.py), and then import functions or classes from maths/primelib.py. In this way, all algorithms can be called and managed in a central location.\r\n\r\n__main.py__\r\n```python\r\nfrom maths.primelib import function1, function2, ...\r\n\r\nresult1 = function1()\r\nresult2 = function2()\r\n```\r\nCreate a collection of algorithm classes:\r\nYou can create a main class that instantiates and manages all other classes containing algorithms. In this way, all algorithms can be accessed through this main class.\r\n\r\n__main_class.py__\r\n```python\r\nfrom maths.primelib import AlgorithmClass1, AlgorithmClass2, ...\r\n\r\nclass MainAlgorithmClass:\r\n    def init(self):\r\n        self.algo1 = AlgorithmClass1()\r\n        self.algo2 = AlgorithmClass2()\r\n\r\n    def execute_algo1(self):\r\n        return self.algo1.function()\r\n\r\n    def execute_algo2(self):\r\n        return self.algo2.function()\r\n```\r\nUsing the plugin architecture:\r\nFor more complex situations, you can consider using a plugin architecture. This typically involves defining a set of interfaces, and then each algorithm implements these interfaces. The main program dynamically loads these plugins (algorithms) at runtime. This approach is more flexible, but it is also more complex to implement.", "I'm interested to work with issue", "@DhanushA1307 We do not assign issues in this repo, just make a PR.

Comment on this issue before starting work so it can be assigned to you. Also, this issue may have been filed with limited detail or changes may have occurred that are worth sharing with you before you start work.\n 2. Drop by our [community chat](https://owncast.rocket.chat/) if you'd like to be involved in more real-time discussion around Owncast to talk about this change.\n 3. Follow the project's getting started tips to make sure you can [build and run the project from source](https://owncast.online/development).\n\n ### Notes\n\n - Development takes place on the `develop` branch.\n - We use Storybook for testing and developing React components. `npm run storybook`. A hosted version [is available for viewing](https://owncast.online/components).\n - If you need to install the Go programming language to run the Owncast backend it's simple from [here](https://go.dev/dl/).\n - Active contributors get an Owncast t-shirt! Ask about it if you feel like you've been contributing and haven't yet been given one.\n\n ### New to Git?\n\n If you're brand new to Git you may want a short primer about the Fork -> Commit -> Pull Request workflow that enables changes to get made collaboratively using git. Visit the [First Contributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) project to learn step-by-step how to commit a change to a Git repository such as this one.", "@gabek I would like to work on this issue, can you please assign it to me?", "Sure, thank you @KshitijBharde!", "@gabek Thanks, I've started working on it, will keep you updated here", "Hi @gabek,\nI was trying to replicate the bug mentioned, I saw it happen only once and I dont think its possible to replicate it deterministically.\n\nI was going through this function which is called on click delete.\n```\n  // File: owncast/web/pages/admin/actions.tsx\n\n  async function handleDelete(index) {\n    const actionsData = [...actions];\n    actionsData.splice(index, 1);\n\n    try {\n      setActions(actionsData);\n      save(actionsData);\n    } catch (error) {\n      console.error(error);\n    }\n  }\n\n```\n\nHere we are trying to update the actionsData using setActions and actionsData is also getting updated after a successful API call to the backend using useEffect\n\nI think we should not try to update using setActions and let useEffects do its thing.\n\nThere might be some kind of race condition happening here.\n\nDo let me know what you think.", "That sounds completely reasonable. The race condition should end up with the same data regardless, but maybe it's causing something else. ", "Hi @gabek,\n\nWe have **two sources of truth** for the actions list:\n\n- `externalActions` (from server-status-context)\n- `actions` (local state, set via `useState` and updated by `setActions`)\n\n `actions` is essentially a local copy of `externalActions`.\nIt is updated every time `externalActions` changes (via `useEffect`).\n\nWe could use `externalActions` directly everywhere you currently use `actions`. \n\n\nThe only reason to keep a separate `actions` state is if you want to:\n- Temporarily show unsaved changes before syncing with the backend (optimistic UI)\n- Allow for local edits that are not immediately reflected in the global state\n\nBut in the code, we always sync `actions` to `externalActions` after every backend update.\nSo, `actions` is just a mirror of `externalActions` and adds unnecessary complexity.\n\n\nMy recommendation would be to directly use externalActions.\nThis will do two things:\n- Avoid any unnecessary re-rendering that might be happening due to duplicate updates\n- Doesn't update the table if a delete/create call fails, in the current code the table gets updated(removes row) and a failure message is shown, if you refresh the page the deleted row is returned by backend again because the update failed\n", "@KshitijBharde Usually the pattern that we have is we make the API call to update the value in the backend, and then update the local representation of it so it displays the value correctly locally. That's pretty much how all of our forms work. Though this one might be functioning differently for some reason." ],

      "description" : "This is a recurring task that has to be done from time to time. \r\n**Do not reference this issue by writing `resolves/fixes #XXX` in your PR because that will close it.**\r\n\r\nWe want to keep the track up to date with [problem specifications](https://github.com/exercism/problem-specifications), which means regularly checking if anything changes and needs updating.\r\n\r\nHow to do this task:\r\n\r\n## Step 1: fetch configlet\r\n\r\nRun:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n./bin/fetch-configlet\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Step 2: check which exercises need updating and in which way\r\n\r\nRun:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n./bin/configlet sync \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe output will list all Java exercises that are out of sync in some way. Example output:\r\n\r\n```text\r\n[warn] docs: instructions unsynced: affine-cipher\r\n[warn] docs: instructions unsynced: all-your-base\r\n\r\n[warn] metadata: unsynced: acronym\r\n[warn] metadata: unsynced: armstrong-numbers\r\n\r\n[warn] collatz-conjecture: missing 2 test cases\r\n       - zero is an error (2187673d-77d6-4543-975e-66df6c50e2da)\r\n       - negative value is an error (ec11f479-56bc-47fd-a434-bcd7a31a7a2e)\r\n```\r\n\r\nChoose one or more problems and attempt to fix it. \r\nMetadata and doc updates can be all done together for many exercises in a single PR, but please create separate PRs per exercise when changing tests.\r\n\r\n## Step 3.1: Sync all docs\r\n\r\nRun this command to update all exercise docs (introductions):\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n ./bin/configlet sync --docs --update\r\n```\r\n\r\nPress `y` when asked `sync the above docs ([y]es/[n]o)?`.\r\n\r\n## Step 3.2: Sync all metadata\r\n\r\nRun this command to update all exercise metadata:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n ./bin/configlet sync --metadata --update\r\n```\r\n\r\nPress `y` when asked `sync the above metadata ([y]es/[n]o)?`.\r\n\r\n## Step 3.3: Update tests for an exercise\r\n\r\nThe general goal is that all Java practice exercises follow problem specifications, except for when it doesn't make any sense in Java.\r\n\r\nImportant:\r\n\r\nGet familiar with the [problem specifications](https://github.com/exercism/problem-specifications) repository and the canonical-data.json format it uses for describing tests cases.\r\nRead [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/exercism/java/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for the general rules of this repository.\r\nPlease create separate a PR per exercise when changing tests.\r\n\r\n### Step 3.3.1 Update tests.toml\r\n\r\nUpdate `tests.toml` by running this command for a chosen exercise:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n./bin/configlet sync --exercise <exercise-slug> --tests --update\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis command assumes that we want to implement all the new tests, and that is our default approach, but it still needs verifying on a test-by-test base.\r\n\r\n### Step 3.3.2 Analyze the new test cases and update the Java tests files accordingly\r\n\r\nFind all the test cases affected by the previous step in the exercise's `canonical-data.json` file in the [problem specifications](https://github.com/exercism/problem-specifications/tree/main/exercises) repository. Analyze what the changes actually are.\r\n\r\nYou might need to delete a test. You might need to add a new test. You might also need to replace an existing test with a new one (you'll see in `tests.toml` that it \"reimplements\" another).\r\n\r\nSome exercises don't even have a `tests.toml` file yet. In this case, carefully check which tests from the `canonical-data.json` are already implemented and make sure the generated `tests.toml` file reflects this.\r\n\r\nIf you believe a new test case shouldn't be implemented, mark it as such in `tests.toml`. For example:\r\n\r\n```toml\r\n[1e22cceb-c5e4-4562-9afe-aef07ad1eaf4]\r\ndescription = \"some test that will not be implemented for this track\"\r\ninclude = false\r\ncomment = \"Not included because <reason>\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen editing the Java tests, make sure to:\r\n\r\nFollow the coding style used in the existing test file.\r\nUse the test description from the `tests.toml` file as name of the test method (unless that would invalidate the first rule).\r\nKeep the order of the tests in the Java test file the same as they are in the `tests.toml` file (unless that would invalidate the first rule).\r\n\r\n### Step 3.3.3 Check that the example solution works with new test cases\r\n\r\nAfter modifying the Java tests, run this command from the `exercises` directory to run them:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n./gradlew practice:<exercise-slug>:test\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf it fails, double-check if the new tests are correct. If they are, that means our example solution for this exercise is no longer valid for the new tests and needs to be updated!\r\n\r\nWhen adding a completely new function that students need to implement, or when changing the return types of an existing one, make sure to also update the stub file.\r\n\r\n## Step 3.4 Remove deprecated files\r\n\r\nPreviously the version of each practice exercise was tracked through a `.meta/version` file. This is no longer being used, so please delete it after syncing an exercise with the problem-specifications.\r\n\r\n## Resources\r\n\r\nNeed help?\r\n\r\n[Configlet docs](https://exercism.org/docs/building/configlet)\r\n[General track docs](https://exercism.org/docs/building/tracks)\r\nDon't hesitate to ask here in case you can't find answers to your questions!",

The easiest way to do so is to fork and clone this repository and run the `bin/fetch-configlet.sh` script from the repository root. This will download the latest version and put it as an executable script in the `bin` directory.\r\n\r\nYou can then use the Configlet to see the number of missing tests for each exercise by running:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nbin/configlet sync --tests\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will print the full list of all tests missing, grouped by exercise. I suggest picking an exercise for which only a one or two tests are missing to start with. Tackling this will teach you how to work with the tooling and how to contribute to this Exercism track.\r\n\r\nOnce you have picked an exercise to update, use the following command to update its auto-generated `.meta/tests.toml`:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nbin/configlet sync --tests --update --exercise <exercise-slug>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will interactively prompt you for each missing test case whether it should be included or not (the answer should probably be _yes_), as well as a description of the test case, its input and expected output.\r\n\r\nWhen this script is finished, all that remains is to update the exercise's Java test suite to include the newly added test case(s).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI'll add you on Discord, in case you want to ask any further questions.

This isn't extra work, because one must *already* call `Number.isNaN()` when handling number values.\r\n\r\nWhy is `Number.NaN` less desirable? Because:\r\n* TypeScript doesn't error if a developer forgets to check for NaN\r\n* TypeScript can't determine whether a NaN check was already performed (extra unnecessary checks)\r\n* Serializing a NaN to JSON resolves to a `null` value anyway\r\n\r\n### \uD83D\uDE2F Current Behavior\r\n\r\nAll values from a NumberField component need to be checked for `Number.isNaN()`. \r\n\r\n### \uD83D\uDC81 Possible Solution\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### \uD83D\uDD26 Context\r\n\r\nI observe most of my team members override `onChange` and `value` properties to support `null` instead.

I have a controlled `NumberField` component and I was surprised to find that the empty value is `NaN` rather than `null`. React Aria radios and Selects accept a controlled value of `null`. `null` is more pleasant for type checking as typescript has no `NaN` type.", "> as typescript has no NaN type\n\nThis isn't quite true, the type is `number`, which was chosen initially to reduce the need to declare state for the NumberField\n```\nfunction ControlledNumberField() {\n  const [value, setValue] = useState(5);\n  return <NumberField value={value} onChange={setValue}\n}\n```\nvs if we had done null, then you'd need to declare the state as\n```\nconst [value, setValue] = useState<number | null>(5);\n```\n\nThat said, everything else uses `null` for no value, so I get that people are used to it.\n\nI was thinking about this some more, I'm not sure how we could make this change without it being breaking. We can't return null from onChange because then the types are breaking for the handler.\n\nIt would also be breaking on the State context that we pass along for React Aria Context.\n\nIt'd be pretty easy to allow it on the value/defaultValue props, if we see `null` come in, we can just reassign to NaN so that changes inside the useNumberFieldState hook are minimal.\n\nWe can't depend on a generic type to enable the new behaviour either, since the logical code wouldn't know about that. We also can't assume that the initial value/defaultValue will be null or NaN, it could change to one of those later in which case we'd initially be emitting the wrong value. We could put it behind a prop, though I don't love that, and I don't have a good name for the prop. Open to possible ideas.\n\nUnfortunately though, I think this is going to need to wait for a major." ],

This feature I am especially excited about, so I hope there will be a fix to it.\n\n4. **Player -> Pause when I'm typing on YouTube**\n\n    * Not related to tabs, so this is why I think there is a problem with pausing the video as well, or accessing the data of if I'm typing or not.\n<br />\n\n**Thank you, if you need more information, let me know.**",

It might still be worth using the \"old\" way in some places ??? with an explanation, or link to one ??? if it shows something useful, like reusing the same set of properties on several widgets.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nAll the code shown still works just fine.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

      "description" : "**Is there an existing issue for this?**\nI have searched the existing issues and checked the recent builds/commits\n\n**What would your feature do ?**\nImplement a versioned default settings system that allows changing default values for new users without affecting existing users who haven't explicitly set a preference. This feature would enable the team to improve the default user experience for new installations while respecting existing users' workflows.\n\n**Proposed workflow**\n1. Add a `defaultsByInstallVersion` field to SettingParams that tracks different defaults based on installation version:\n   ```typescript\n   {\n     id: 'Comfy.LinkRelease.Action',\n     defaultValue: LinkReleaseTriggerAction.CONTEXT_MENU,\n     defaultsByInstallVersion: {\n       '1.21.3': LinkReleaseTriggerAction.SEARCH_BOX,\n       '1.40.3': LinkReleaseTriggerAction.FUTURE_FEATURE\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. Store an `installedVersion` setting when a user first runs the application. For refernce how to do this, search how `Comfy.TutorialCompleted` setting is set. You may also need to update tests to set this value, unless a test case specifically wants to test things for a new user. Again just search how it is handled for `Comfy.TutorialCompleted`\n\n3. Installed versions can be found in systemStatsStore or as a global variable on window object. When getting a setting's default value:\n   - If user has `installedVersion` >= specified version, use the versioned default\n   - If user has no `installedVersion` (existing user), use the original `defaultValue`\n   - This ensures backward compatibility for existing users\n\n4. The setting store's `getDefaultValue` function would be updated to check `defaultsByInstallVersion` based on the user's installation version\n\n**Additional information**\nThis approach was discussed in PR #3652 as a solution for changing the default link release action from context menu to search box for new users only. The implementation would:\n- Maintain clean separation between user preferences and system defaults\n- Allow progressive enhancement of defaults without disrupting existing users\n- Provide a clear audit trail of when defaults changed\n- Support A/B testing of defaults in the future if needed\n\nRelated discussion: https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_frontend/pull/3652#issuecomment-2447681991",

      "description" : "Currently there is a lot of duplicated code in the rpc `v6`, `v7` and `v8` sub packages. We should remove duplicated code (types, functions, tests) where possible. For example, the `blockHashAndNumber` function (and associated type `BlockHashAndNumber`) has not changed between `v6`, `v7` and `v8`. This means that we can remove this function (and type) from `v7` and `v8`, and have the top level handler use the code in `v6` instead (specifically update the `MethodsV0_8` and `MethodsV0_7` functions). See this [PR](https://github.com/NethermindEth/juno/pull/2436/files) as an example. We should do this for all RPC methods. I would suggest doing the following:\n\n1. Create a PR for each RPC method (this will make it easier to track changes, work on, and review)\n2. If the RPC method has not changed between (eg) `v6`, `v7` and `v8`, then we can just re-use the `v6` code in `v7` and `v8`. This means the corresponding code (function, types, tests) should be deleted in `v7` and `v8`.\n3. If the RPC function has changed, then we should not remove the function. However, if the associated type has not changed, then we should probably delete it.\n4. To keep track of all the changes being made, and still to be made, to the RPC pkg, please add a new bullet point here and link the associated PR.\n\n- [x] [starknet_chainId](https://github.com/NethermindEth/juno/pull/2446)\n- [x] [starknet_blockNumber](https://github.com/NethermindEth/juno/pull/2445)\n- [x] [starknet_blockHashAndNumber](https://github.com/NethermindEth/juno/pull/2436/files)\n- [x] [BlockStatus enum](https://github.com/NethermindEth/juno/pull/2447) (Not really an RPC endpoint but useful for other endpoints, such as starknet_getBlockWithTxHashes)\n- [x] [Header struct](https://github.com/NethermindEth/juno/pull/2448) (Not really an RPC endpoint but useful for other endpoints, such as starknet_getBlockWithTxHashes)\n- [x] [starknet_getBlockWithTxHashes](https://github.com/NethermindEth/juno/pull/2449)\n- [x] [Refactor type Transaction struct](https://github.com/NethermindEth/juno/issues/2458) (Not really an RPC endpoint but useful for other endpoints)\n- [x] [starknet_syncing](https://github.com/NethermindEth/juno/pull/2459)\n- [x] [starknet_getNonce](https://github.com/NethermindEth/juno/pull/2463)\n- [x] [starknet_getClassAt](https://github.com/NethermindEth/juno/pull/2465)\n- [x] [starknet_getClassHashAt](https://github.com/NethermindEth/juno/pull/2466)\n- [x] [starknet_getClass](https://github.com/NethermindEth/juno/pull/2467)\n- [x] [starknet_getEvents](https://github.com/NethermindEth/juno/pull/2469)\n- [ ] [juno_version](https://github.com/NethermindEth/juno/pull/2471), [Attempt 2](https://github.com/NethermindEth/juno/pull/2793)\n- [x] [starknet_getStorageProof](https://github.com/NethermindEth/juno/pull/2474)\n- [x] [starknet_getTransactionByHash](https://github.com/NethermindEth/juno/pull/2486)\n- [x] [starknet_getTransactionCount](https://github.com/NethermindEth/juno/pull/2488)\n- [x] [starknet_getStateUpdate](https://github.com/NethermindEth/juno/pull/2490)\n- [x] [starknet_call](https://github.com/NethermindEth/juno/pull/2491)\n- [x] [starknet_estimateMessageFee](https://github.com/NethermindEth/juno/pull/2496)\n- [x] [juno/starknet_unsubscribe](https://github.com/NethermindEth/juno/pull/2509)\n- [x] [starknet_add...Transaction](https://github.com/NethermindEth/juno/pull/2534)\n- [x] [starknet_traceTransaction](https://github.com/NethermindEth/juno/pull/2545)\n\n## Remaining endpoints to check\n\n- ~~starknet_getBlockWithReceipts~~\n- ~~starknet_getCompiledCasm~~\n- ~~starknet_specVersion~~\n- ~~starknet_subscribeEvents~~\n- ~~starknet_subscribeTransactionStatus~~\n- ~~starknet_getBlockWithTxs~~\n- ~~starknet_getTransactionByHash~~\n- ~~starknet_getTransactionReceipt~~\n- ~~starknet_getBlockTransactionCount~~\n- ~~starknet_getTransactionByBlockIdAndIndex~~\n- ~~starknet_getStateUpdate~~\n- ~~starknet_addInvokeTransaction~~\n- ~~starknet_addDeployAccountTransaction~~\n- ~~starknet_addDeclareTransaction~~\n- ~~starknet_getTransactionStatus~~\n- ~~starknet_call~~\n- ~~starknet_estimateFee~~\n- ~~starknet_estimateMessageFee~~\n- ~~starknet_traceTransaction~~ --> decided not to go for refactoring after all.

      "comments" : [ "# :wave: Important: PLEASE READ :wave:\n\nThis issue has been labeled as a **good first issue** and is available for anyone to work on.\n\nIf this is your first time contributing to an open source project, some aspects of the development process may seem unusual, arcane, or some combination of both.\n\n1.  **You cannot \"claim\" issues.** People new to open source often want to \"claim\" or be assigned an issue before beginning work. The typical rationale is that people want to avoid wasted work in the event that someone else ends up working the issue. However, this practice is not effective in open source, as it often leads to \"issue squatting\", in which an individual asks to be assigned, is granted their request, and then never ends up working on the issue. Accordingly, you are encouraged to communicate your intent to address this issue, ideally by providing a rough outline as to how you plan to address the issue or asking clarifying questions, but, at the end of the day, we will take running code and rough consensus in order to move forward quickly.\n2.  **We have a very high bar for contributions.** We have very high standards for contributions and expect all contributions???whether new features, tests, or documentation???to be rigorous, thorough, and complete. Once a pull request is merged into stdlib, that contribution immediately becomes the collective responsibility of all maintainers of stdlib. When we merge code into stdlib, we are saying that we, the maintainers, commit to reviewing subsequent changes and making bugfixes to the code. Hence, in order to ensure future maintainability, this naturally leads to a higher standard of contribution.\n\nBefore working on this issue and opening a pull request, please read the project's [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md). These guidelines and the associated [development guide](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/docs/contributing/development.md) provide important information, including links to stdlib's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), license policy, and steps for setting up your local development environment.\n\nTo reiterate, we **strongly** encourage you to refer to our contributing guides **before** beginning work on this issue. Failure to follow our guidelines significantly decreases the likelihood that you'll successfully contribute to stdlib and may result in automatic closure of a pull request without review.\n\nSetting up your local development environment is a critical first step, as doing so ensures that automated development processes for linting, license verification, and unit testing can run prior to authoring commits and pushing changes. If you would prefer to avoid manual setup, we provide pre-configured [development containers](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/tree/develop/.devcontainer) for use locally or in GitHub Codespaces.\n\nWe place a high value on consistency throughout the stdlib codebase. We encourage you to closely examine other packages in stdlib and attempt to emulate the practices and conventions found therein.\n\n-   If you are attempting to contribute a new package, sometimes the best approach is to simply copy the contents of an existing package and then modify the minimum amount necessary to implement the feature (e.g., changing descriptions, parameter names, and implementation).\n-   If you are contributing tests, find a package implementing a similar feature and emulate the tests of that package.\n-   If you are updating documentation, examine several similar packages and emulate the content, style, and prose of those packages.\n\nIn short, the more effort you put in to ensure that your contribution looks and feels like stdlib???including variables names, bracket spacing, line breaks, etc???the more likely that your contribution will be reviewed and ultimately accepted. We encourage you to closely study the codebase **before** beginning work on this issue.\n\n:sparkles: Thank you again for your interest in stdlib, and we look forward to reviewing your future contributions. :sparkles:\n" ],

Comment on this issue before starting work so it can be assigned to you. Also, this issue may have been filed with limited detail or changes may have occurred that are worth sharing with you before you start work.\n 2. Drop by our [community chat](https://owncast.rocket.chat/) if you'd like to be involved in more real-time discussion around Owncast to talk about this change.\n 3. Follow the project's getting started tips to make sure you can [build and run the project from source](https://owncast.online/development).\n\n ### Notes\n\n - Development takes place on the `develop` branch.\n - We use Storybook for testing and developing React components. `npm run storybook`. A hosted version [is available for viewing](https://owncast.online/components).\n - If you need to install the Go programming language to run the Owncast backend it's simple from [here](https://go.dev/dl/).\n - Active contributors get an Owncast t-shirt! Ask about it if you feel like you've been contributing and haven't yet been given one.\n\n ### New to Git?\n\n If you're brand new to Git you may want a short primer about the Fork -> Commit -> Pull Request workflow that enables changes to get made collaboratively using git. Visit the [First Contributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) project to learn step-by-step how to commit a change to a Git repository such as this one.", "I would like to work on this", "Great, thanks @sho29!", "This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity.

Previously, the layout had inconsistent button sizes, lack of proper spacing, and weak visual hierarchy, making the interface less intuitive. These enhancements improve readability, accessibility, and overall user experience.\n\n**Changes Implemented**\n\nHeader Layout: Added a \"Group Name\" label, increased group name size, and aligned the primary mentor section for better structure.\n\nSection Styling: Introduced light gray backgrounds, subtle shadows, and better spacing to visually separate sections.\n\nButton Consistency: Standardized button sizes, improved alignment, and added hover effects.\n\nVisual Hierarchy: Improved typography, spacing, padding, and margins for a more professional look.\n\n**Screenshots**\n\nBefore:\n\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f082aa89-32c7-4bec-8907-a7fde0b66aa3\" />\n\nAfter:\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d40387fe-9941-4f29-9bcb-4e331ede97b4\n\nAdditional Context\n\nThese refinements contribute to a more structured and user-friendly experience, making navigation and interaction more seamless.\n\nAre you working on this issue?\n\n???

Like custom instructions, this is a case where the eval score will be quite different depending on the value used but duplicating models seems like a lot of work since there are ~4 sizes of MRL per model. \n\nBut arguments are saved out somewhere right (the `encode_kwargs`) so perhaps that could be the reference.", "> but duplicating models seems like a lot of work since there are ~4 sizes of MRL per model.\n\nI don't think that this a lot of work, because only model meta would be duplicated\n\n> But arguments are saved out somewhere right (the encode_kwargs) so perhaps that could be the reference.\n\nYes, but it would be hard to fit them in layout of results ", "So for one model that supports MRL the current interface is:\n\n```py\nimport mteb\n\ntasks = mteb.get_tasks(tasks=[\"LccSentimentClassification\"])\neval = mteb.MTEB(tasks=tasks)\n\n\nmeta = mteb.get_model_meta(\"openai/text-embedding-3-small\")\n\n\nmodel = meta.load_model()  # Default embed_dim is 1536\nresults = eval.run(model, overwrite_results=True)\nprint(f\"Score: {results[0].get_score()} with embedding dimension {meta.embed_dim}\")\n# Score: 0.5946666666666667 with embedding dimension 1536\n\n# changing the embedding dimension to 256\nmodel = meta.load_model(embed_dim=256)\nresults = eval.run(model, overwrite_results=True)\nprint(f\"Score: {results[0].get_score()} with embedding dimension 256\")\n# Score: 0.5706666666666667 with embedding dimension 256\n```\n\nIn v1 or v2, nothing is saved to distinguish these two runs, though.\n\nI am not sure what the best solution is, but I am probably leaning toward:\n\n```py\n# Proposed interface:\nresults = eval.run(model, overwrite_results=True, encode_kwargs={\"embed_dim\": 256})\n```\n\nand then save the encode_kwargs in the model_meta.json? (Though it would be overwritten if you run it with a different set of encode_kwargs, it would also hit the cache across embed_dim settings.)\n\nWe could also have it save it as a separate models as @Samoed suggests, but that seems a bit frustrating to me.\n\nEssentially: \n`openai/text-embedding-3-small`, default embedding size\n`openai/text-embedding-3-small (embed_dim=256)`\n\nThat is probably the easiest short-term fix, but it will be frustrating once we get more models.", "> and then save the encode_kwargs in the model_meta.json?

Not merging this back into MTEB and keeping it separate just for my experiments until someone does it a better way\n2. Merging it in but only as a wrapper class for people to use and not to go into leaderboards \n3. Update my code to have the wrapper class modify the model's name somehow to add the \"(embed_dim=256)\" string automatically, perhaps solving both issues\n\nAny of these are fine, do you have preferences @KennethEnevoldsen @Samoed?", "> Update my code to have the wrapper class modify the model's name somehow to add the \"(embed_dim=256)\" string automatically, perhaps solving both issues\n\nThis probably will be a solution, but we need a list of all possible values that we would handle like this", "I was thinking it would be dynamic, whatever value was passed to `mrl_dim`. I am not sure how easy it is to modify the name of the model (if that is in the model section or deeper in the MTEB stack) but it would be a nice solution if it could be modified from the model side." ],

It helps us discover the source of the problem, and also can reveal assumptions you or we might be making.\n\n### What will happen?\n\nIf you've provided a reproduction, we'll remove the label and try to reproduce the issue. If we can, we'll mark it as a bug and prioritize it based on its severity and how many people we think it might affect.\n\nIf `needs reproduction` labeled issues don't receive any substantial activity (e.g., new comments featuring a reproduction link), we'll close them. That's not because we don't care! At any point, feel free to comment with a reproduction and we'll reopen it.\n\n### How can I create a reproduction?\n\nWe have a couple of templates for starting with a minimal reproduction:\n\n\uD83D\uDC49 https://stackblitz.com/github/nuxt/starter/tree/v3-stackblitz\n\uD83D\uDC49 https://codesandbox.io/s/github/nuxt/starter/v3-codesandbox\n\nA public GitHub repository is also perfect. \uD83D\uDC4C\n\nPlease ensure that the reproduction is as **minimal** as possible. See more details [in our guide](https://nuxt.com/docs/community/reporting-bugs/#create-a-minimal-reproduction).\n\nYou might also find these other articles interesting and/or helpful:\n\n- [The Importance of Reproductions](https://antfu.me/posts/why-reproductions-are-required)\n- [How to Generate a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable Example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example)\n\n</details>\n", "I also have this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nd:\\Projects\\NuxtStarter>npx nuxi init test\r\n\r\n???

I was exploring something similar, but as this is a new area for me, I'll aim to put together a basic working version of this experimentatal purpose soon.  \n\nThat said, it would be great if someone with more experience in this area could take the lead on this ticket. It looks like we might need an **Open-Source LLM** with **LangChain** using a **RAG-based approach**. I'll keep this open for someone with the right expertise to pick it.  \n\nIt also sounds like you???re looking for a **\"Copy\"** option, then I think some **JavaScript or TypeScript** knowledge would be helpful here.  \n\n**Is there anyone in-house who can take this on and help define the ACs?**  \n\n### Suggested Skill sets are (Feel free to amend the list below!):  \n- Open-Source LLM (or GPT-based text model)  \n- LangChain  \n- RAG  \n- JavaScript  \n- Python  \n\nLooking forward to any contributions!

Find all `raise HTTPException()`.\r\n2. Create a call graph, on which we store the information of which callables are being called from a callable.

The problem is, the frontend can't know what the slippage will be on the position removal. Its usually small on the order of 1 unit, but we can't assume, and if we do then its possible the user will be left with one unit of an asset which is anoyying.\r\n\r\n## Suggested Design\r\n\r\nCreate a message that calls both of these messages in one. It uses whatever the output of the position removal as the position creation.\r\n\r\n## Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\nMessage created and tested on localosmosis.\r\n",

Run `npx oauth2-mock-server -p 53485`\n2. In your React app that uses @auth0/auth0-react try to login using login provider\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nUser is successfully logged in and there is no token error\n\n## Environment\n\n- `oauth2-mock-server` version: 8.1.0\n- Noje.JS version: 20.19.3\n- NPM version: 10.8.2\n- Operating System: MacOS\n\n## Additional Context\n\n### Workaround\nAs a workaround I had to manually create and start the server\n```\n  const oauth2Server = new OAuth2Server();\n  const loginProviderHost = \"http://localhost:53485\";\n\n  // Configure with trailing slash in issuer URL\n  oauth2Server.issuer.url = `${loginProviderHost}/`;\n\n  await oauth2Server.issuer.keys.generate(\"RS256\");\n\n  const [port] = loginProviderHost.split(\":\").slice(-1);\n  await oauth2Server.start(parseInt(port));\n```\n\nThe default URL is built [here](https://github.com/axa-group/oauth2-mock-server/blob/bacf8c6af265381bb1f5055b7094d3f94422dda2/src/lib/http-server.ts#L119) clearly without trailing slash so maybe it is expected behavior and works fine with other libraries. If this a case this can be converted into the feature to allow setting issuer from CLI as well as from the code",

      "comments" : [ "<!-- Answer -->\nThis is a known limitation in Flipt v1: cache invalidation for flag evaluations relies mainly on TTL, and manual eviction only happens for direct flag or variant updates. Updates to rollout rules (or segments) often do not trigger immediate cache invalidation, so changes like setting a rollout to 100% may not be reflected until the cache entry expires. This is because the system avoids complex dependency tracking for cache eviction and instead relies on periodic TTL-based eviction for most evaluation results. See details in [this PR](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt/pull/954).\n\nIf you need changes to take effect immediately, you can temporarily disable the cache or reduce the TTL as a workaround. The underlying issue is that the update flow for rollout rules may not be calling the cache invalidation routine (`DeleteFlag`) as expected, which is likely the root cause of the stale evaluations you???re seeing.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

I'm [Dosu](https://dosu.dev), your friendly bot here to help you squash bugs, answer questions, and assist you in becoming a contributor. I'm here while you wait for a human maintainer. Let's tackle this issue together!\n\n<!-- Answer -->\nI found a similar unsolved discussion titled [Swagger API page is empty](https://github.com/apache/superset/discussions/18311), which might be related to the issue you're experiencing with accessing the Swagger API after enabling prefix routing <sup>[[1]](https://github.com/apache/superset/discussions/18311)</sup>.\n\nTo address your issue, you can customize the OpenAPI/Swagger UI configuration to accommodate prefix routing by setting the root path prefix using the `SUPERSET_APP_ROOT` environment variable. This can be done by customizing the Flask entrypoint. The `create_app` function in `superset/app.py` allows you to specify a non-root path for the application using the `superset_app_root` parameter. Here's how you can configure it:\n\n```sh\nFLASK_APP=\"superset:create_app(superset_app_root='/charts')\"\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `--app` argument with `flask run`:\n\n```sh\nflask --app \"superset.app:create_app(superset_app_root='/charts')\"\n```\n\nThe `AppRootMiddleware` class in `superset/app.py` ensures that the application, including the OpenAPI/Swagger UI, is served under the specified prefix by adjusting the `PATH_INFO` and `SCRIPT_NAME` environment variables. This setup should help in correctly routing the API endpoints under the specified prefix <sup>[[2]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/docs/docs/configuration/configuring-superset.mdx)</sup><sup>[[3]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset/app.py)</sup>.\n\nAdditionally, ensure that your Swagger/OpenAPI configuration is correctly set up to reflect the prefix in the URL. If you want to expose the Swagger config, you might need to adjust the configuration to include the prefix in the `url` parameter, as you suggested. However, the specific setting `OPENAPI_SWAGGER_UI_CONFIG` wasn't found in the available documentation, so you might need to explore the codebase or configuration files further to implement this change.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To continue talking to [Dosu](https://dosu.dev), mention @dosu.*\n\n---\n<sup>Help Dosu learn!

Thank you for your interest in contributing to NetLogo.\r\n\r\nThe first step is to make sure you have the necessary tools installed and a development environment setup.  We have [documentation on how to do that in the wiki](https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo/wiki/Building).  Once you are able to do a `netlogo/run` from an sbt session you should be able to start working on the issue.\r\n\r\nAs Robert outlined, there are two basic steps to complete this task:\r\n\r\n1. Update [the shapes `EditorDialog` to be resizable](https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo/blob/hexy/netlogo-gui/src/main/shape/editor/EditorDialog.java#L72).\r\n2. Update [the shape `graphicPanel`](https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo/blob/hexy/netlogo-gui/src/main/shape/editor/EditorDialog.java#L472) to expand to fill any extra space when the dialog is resized.  The panel and the shape should remain centered when this happens.\r\n\r\nThere was a prior attempt to get this working that wound up not getting merged.  You can look at [the pull request that was made](https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo/pull/1578/files) as an extra reference.  You do not need to do things how they did it or use that code at all, but it's not a bad place to start.\r\n\r\nIf you have questions, I recommend asking either in [our NetLogo Gitter chat channel](https://gitter.im/NetLogo/NetLogo?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link), or in [the NetLogo devel Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/netlogo-devel).\r\n", "I'm not sure if this would provide any benefit, because currently, shapes are cropped to a square or circular area. So even if you expanded the window to allow you to draw outside the bounds of the central area, everything you drew outside would get cropped away at runtime." ],

Add Field Filters \n\n**Expected behavior:**\nA more functional UX for filters that match a large number of fields (e.g. 100+).\n\n**Screenshots (if relevant):**\n\n<img width=\"726\" height=\"956\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5cbdd3fd-9914-4053-9bb8-3d5809f6b64a\" />\n\n\n",

Then I found this ??? clean, functional, and just works.\n\n**One suggestion:**\nWould it be possible to think first, then reply a pre-message, and only after that trigger the MCP? Something like this:\n\nUser: `Show me the last 10 AI news`\nModel (thinking mode): ???Alright, the user is asking for tech-related news??? let me check if there???s any available MCP for that??? found one, now I???ll trigger it.???\nModel reply user right away: Got it ??? here are the latest AI updates: \n[MCP call]\n\nThis kind of pre-processing ??? with a message before actually calling the MCP ??? would make the flow feel smarter and more human-like, especially for models that support thinking mode.\n\nClaude, for example, shows a pre-message before executing the function call:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/adb41e6a-36d2-4b8f-91c1-48e02afc5a52)\n\nIn my tests here, though, it just fires the MCP without expose thinking, and without pre-message, just call mcp immediately, without showing that thought process.", "I???ve left a related comment on #107.\n\nSome level of handling for the `<think>` tag can be done through middleware.\nYou can find more details here:\n[https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/extract-reasoning-middleware](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/extract-reasoning-middleware)\n\n", "> I???ve left a related comment on [#107](https://github.com/cgoinglove/mcp-client-chatbot/issues/107).\n> \n> Some level of handling for the `<think>` tag can be done through middleware. You can find more details here: https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/extract-reasoning-middleware\n\nAre you referring to properly showing the 'thinking mode' UI, or to making the model actually think and send a pre-message before triggering the MCP?", "Oh, I'm sorry. I think my opinion was a bit off because I was using translations due to my lack of English skills.\n\nDoes the issue you mentioned mean that you want to think before executing rather than executing immediately before using the tool?\n", "Sorry, I accidentally mixed two things in the same post.\n\nThere are two separate points here:\n\n1. About the <think> tag not being formatted\nThis was just a formatting issue I noticed with the Together provider.  \n\n\n2. About the execution flow (this is the important part)\nIt???s not a bug, but rather a UX detail that feels off.\n\nRight now, the model executes the MCP immediately after the user request. This feels robotic. The ideal flow would make the interaction more human by adding at least a pre-message before call mcp:\n\n\n\n### Current behavior:\n```\nUser: Generate a video of a flying airplane\n??? MCP call happens immediately\nAI: The video is ready, I made a plane fly as requested.\n```\n\n\n### Ideal behavior:\n```\nUser: Generate a video of a flying airplane\nAI: Sure, I???ll generate the video for you.\n??? MCP call\nAI: The video is ready, I made a plane fly as requested.\n```\n\n### Even better with a \"thinking\" step:\n```\nUser: Generate a video of a flying airplane\nAI: <think>Okay, the user is asking for a video. I have the tools to do this via mcp.video-test. I???ll let them know I???m generating it now.</think>\nAI: Sure, I???ll generate the video for you.\n??? MCP call\nAI: The video is ready, I made a plane fly as requested.\n```\n\n\nBelow I will atach some prints:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea0311aa-687a-4b58-8384-f36fc960a7ed)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eed4f533-df8a-4ff8-a6d0-fce46ffed2a1)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92394f51-a2f4-43c4-8a87-18ba4e35c016)\n\nSummary:\nThe goal is to have a more human-like flow, where the model acknowledges the user's request before triggering the MCP, and optionally includes a <think> step to simulate internal reasoning.\n", "I understand what you said.\n\nActually, it depends on the model. For example, in the case of Claude Sonnet, it often explains how it will use a tool before actually using it. On the other hand, Gemini usually does not use a tool right away unless there is a clear purpose for tool usage, and instead asks for more detailed information first.\n\nHowever, a simple way to apply this to all models is to add a brief comment in the system prompt before using any tool.\n\nAs a temporary measure, I added the following to the project's default system prompt:\n\n```typescript\n  // Tool usage explanation guidelines\n\n  prompt += `\n\n\n\n### Tool Usage Guidelines ###\n\n<tool_usage>\n\n- Before using any tool, briefly think out loud about what you need to do and which tool would help\n\n- Express your reasoning naturally before taking action\n\n- This builds transparency and helps users follow your thought process\n\n</tool_usage>`.trim();\n```\n\n<img width=\"868\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e085cc50-b7f4-41e8-8bc1-a0658c09f2c1\" />", "Sorry for late update; I'm planning to do this after the ai sdk v5 migration ", "Amazing!

In my testing on AKS, this led to unexpected behavior where services targeting the port by name were bound only to the first container with that name.\n\nWould it be possible to update the manifests (both in the Helm chart and the deploy folder) to assign unique port names per container? For example, renaming them to something like http-endpoint-provisioner, http-endpoint-attacher, etc., might resolve the warning and prevent potential routing issues.\n\nThanks for looking into this!", "Ok created https://github.com/ceph/ceph-csi/pull/5413 for that" ],
