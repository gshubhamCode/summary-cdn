It has no machine status awareness mechanism and simply accumulates all total allocatable resources, which can easily lead to errors in subsequent realCapability and deserved calculations. RealCapability affects the logic of whether a pod is created when Q resources are insufficient, and deserve affects the logic of whether Q is overused and whether the pods under it can be scheduled.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f85a5d8b-32a4-4fed-9e39-095409caf5f8)\n\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\n\n1.node is stop scheduling but TotalResource is not perceived\n2.node is notReady but TotalResource is not perceived\n\n\n### Describe the results you received and expected\n\nTotalResource can perceived node realy status\n\n### What version of Volcano are you using?\n\n1.12.1\n\n### Any other relevant information\n\n_No response_",

      "description" : "### Apache Airflow Provider(s)\n\nhttp\n\n### Versions of Apache Airflow Providers\n\n5.3.0\n\n### Apache Airflow version\n\n3.0.2\n\n### Operating System\n\nUbuntu 24.04.2 LTS\n\n### Deployment\n\nVirtualenv installation\n\n### Deployment details\n\n- **Deployment Type**: Virtualenv installation\n- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS\n- **Python Version**: 3.12.3\n- **Airflow Version**: 3.0.2\n- **HTTP Provider Version**: 5.3.0\n- **Database Backend**: PostgreSQL 16\n- **Secrets Backend**: Microsoft Azure Key Vault\n- **Authentication**: Flask AppBuilder (FAB) with Microsoft Entra ID (SSO)\n- **SSL Configuration**: Enabled with custom certificates\n- **Timezone**: Pacific/Auckland\n- **Airflow Services Management**: systemd unit files for `api-server`, `scheduler`, `dag-processor`, and `triggerer`\n- **Custom Configuration Highlights**:\n  - Airflow configuration (`airflow.cfg`) includes:\n    - `sql_alchemy_conn_secret` for DB connection string\n    - Azure Key Vault integration for secrets\n    - SSL cert/key paths\n    - FAB auth manager\n  - Environment variables for Azure credentials (`AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`)\n  - Custom `webserver_config.py` for SSO\n  - Firewall configured to allow port 8443\n\n### What happened\n\nI encountered an issue while using a deferrable `HttpSensor` in Airflow 3.0.2. The sensor is configured to use a connection (`https_host-has-no-schema`) with the following details:\n\n- **Host**: `dummyjson.com`\n- **Port**: `443`\n- **Schema**: `https`\n\nDuring the initial execution, the sensor correctly uses `HttpHook` to send a GET request to `https://dummyjson.com:443/fake_endpoint`, receives a 404 response, and defers the task as expected.\n\nHowever, when the deferred task resumes via `HttpSensorTrigger`, the trigger internally creates an `HttpAsyncHook` object. This hook retrieves the connection using `self.get_connection(self.http_conn_id)` but appears to lose the `schema` value. As a result, the final request URL becomes `http://dummyjson.com:443/fake_endpoint`, which is incorrect and causes unexpected behavior.\n\nThis discrepancy between `HttpHook` and `HttpAsyncHook` in handling the connection schema seems to stem from how the connection object is retrieved and interpreted asynchronously. The issue may involve `BaseHook.get_connection`, `Connection`, or `TaskSDKConnection` not properly preserving or propagating the `schema` field.\n\nHere’s a log fragment showing the incorrect behavior. The first request `https` but the second request is `http`.\n```log\n[2025-06-27, 01:46:26] INFO - Connection Retrieved 'https_host-has-no-schema': source=\"airflow.hooks.base\"\n[2025-06-27, 01:46:26] DEBUG - Connection Details: 'Connection(conn_id='https_host-has-no-schema', conn_type='http', description=None, host='dummyjson.com', schema='https', login=None, password=None, port=443, extra=None)': source=\"airflow.hooks.base\"\n[2025-06-27, 01:46:26] DEBUG - Sending 'GET' to url: https://dummyjson.com:443/fake_endpoint: source=\"airflow.task.hooks.airflow.providers.http.hooks.http.HttpHook\"\n......\n[2025-06-27, 01:46:31] INFO - Connection Retrieved 'https_host-has-no-schema': source=\"airflow.hooks.base\"\n[2025-06-27, 01:46:31] DEBUG - Connection Details: 'Connection(conn_id='https_host-has-no-schema', conn_type='http', description=None, host='dummyjson.com', schema=None, login=None, password=None, port=443, extra=None)': source=\"airflow.hooks.base\"\n[2025-06-27, 01:46:31] WARNING - [Try 1 of 3] Request to http://dummyjson.com:443/fake_endpoint failed.: source=\"airflow.providers.http.hooks.http.HttpAsyncHook\"\n```\n\n### What you think should happen instead\n\nThe expected behavior is that both HttpHook and HttpAsyncHook should consistently respect the schema field defined in the Airflow connection. In this case, the connection https_host-has-no-schema explicitly sets schema=https, so all HTTP requests — synchronous or asynchronous — should use https:// in the final URL.\n\n### How to reproduce\n\n1. **Create an Airflow connection** named `https_host-has-no-schema` with the following settings:\n   - **Host**: `dummyjson.com`\n   - **Port**: `443`\n   - **Schema**: `https`\n   - Leave login, password, and extra fields empty.\n\n2. **Create a DAG** with the following code:\n\n   ```python\n   from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n   from airflow import DAG\n   from airflow.providers.http.sensors.http import HttpSensor\n   from airflow.providers.http.operators.http import HttpOperator\n\n   with DAG(\n       dag_id=\"dag_reproduce_issue\",\n       description=\"Reproduce\",\n       start_date=datetime.now() - timedelta(days=1),\n       schedule=None,\n       catchup=False,\n       default_args={\n           \"retries\": 0,\n           \"retry_delay\": timedelta(minutes=1),\n       },\n       tags=[\"reproduce_issue\"],\n   ) as dag:\n\n       https_operator = HttpOperator(\n           task_id=\"https_operator\",\n           http_conn_id=\"https_host-has-no-schema\",\n           endpoint=\"products\",\n           method=\"GET\",\n       )\n\n       https_sensor = HttpSensor(\n           task_id=\"https_sensor\",\n           http_conn_id=\"https_host-has-no-schema\",\n           endpoint=\"fake_endpoint\",\n           method=\"GET\",\n           deferrable=True,\n           poke_interval=30,\n           timeout=60,\n       )\n\n       https_operator >> https_sensor\n   ```\n\n3. **Run the DAG**. Observe the following:\n   - `https_operator` sends a request to `https://dummyjson.com:443/products` and succeeds.\n   - `https_sensor` initially sends a request to `https://dummyjson.com:443/fake_endpoint`, receives a 404, and defers.\n   - When resumed by `HttpSensorTrigger`, the request is sent to `http://dummyjson.com:443/fake_endpoint` instead of `https`.\n\n4. **Check the logs** of the triggerer process to confirm the incorrect URL schema.\n\n### Anything else\n\nThis issue occurs **every time** under the following conditions:\n\n- The Airflow connection's **host** field does **not include a URL schema** (i.e., no `http://` or `https://`).\n- The **schema** field in the connection is explicitly set to `https`.\n- The `HttpSensor` is set to `deferrable=True`. I did not test when `deferrable=False`.\n\nUnder these conditions, the `HttpAsyncHook` used by `HttpSensorTrigger` fails to apply the `https` schema and defaults to `http`, resulting in incorrect request URLs.\n\nHowever, if the host is set to `https://dummyjson.com` (i.e., includes the schema directly in the host field), the issue does **not** occur. In that case, both the host and port are correctly loaded and used by `HttpAsyncHook`.\n\nTo better observe this behavior, it is recommended to enable **DEBUG logging level** in Airflow. This will show the full request URL constructed by the hook and confirm whether the schema is being applied correctly.\n\n### Are you willing to submit PR?\n\n- [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n",

Solving this issue would greatly improve the UX, as currently I need to zoom in every time to read the text if the email contains even a remotely lengthy non-breakable string, which gets increasingly likely in a long chain of replies.\r\nSide note: it seems to me that some word-breaking is performed, but it isn't applied to fixed-width text, or long strings like URLs, so replies in long chains are sometimes ridiculously malformed (to the point where the text becomes vertical instead of horizontal, i.e. 1 character per line).", "@cketti any idea what a good fix for this might be?", "+1", "please forgive my bump of the issue, but are there any updates on this?", "@cketti If you point me in the direction of a fix, I can work on this.", "Really need this.

If you disable it, then a bugzilla email with a long pushloghtml link will show zoomed in, but you might actually have to zoom out or scroll a bit to read all content. \n\nIf you have the same email on Thunderbird desktop it simply has a horizontal scrollbar. So I guess this would be about changing the default for auto-fit?\n\n", "Further notes from conversation with Ryan: We should do something about images as well, otherwise they either clip or make it zoom out. Then let's see if we can change the default setting on beta with a feature flag and see how the reception is.\n\nhttps://searchfox.org/comm-central/source/mail/themes/shared/mail/messageBody.css sets max-width: 100% on images if shrinktofit is enabled, which appears to be the case by default. It also forces overflow:auto on the root node.\n\n\n(Side note it would be cool if we had a system to change defaults, so that we can migrate users without having to think about the implications every time. But that is for another issue.)", "This could be a good first bug, though requires some very targeted exploratory testing with different emails in order to find edge cases.

We need to add more to cover all the code in vllm-ascend, and there are several principles to follow:\n\n1. The overall file tree should be consistent with `vllm_ascend`\n2. The file name should be the original file name with a prefix `test_`\n3. Use `unittest` framework, make good use of mock\n4. The UTs are all running on cpu node, mock the function related to device to host\n\n### Unit tests need to add\n\n- [ ] |-- test__version.py\n- [x] |-- test_ascend_config.py\n- [ ] |-- test_attention\n- [ ] |   |-- test_attention.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_attention_v1.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_mla_v1.py\n- [ ] |-- compilation\n- [ ] |   `-- test_piecewise_backend.py\n- [ ] |-- core\n- [ ] |   |-- test_schedule_config.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_scheduler.py\n- [ ] |-- device_allocator\n- [ ] |   `-- test_camem.py\n- [ ] |-- distributed\n- [ ] |   |-- test_communicator.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_device_communicators\n- [ ] |   |   |-- test_pyhccl.py\n- [ ] |   |   `-- test_pyhccl_wrapper.py\n- [ ] |   |-- kv_transfer @Agonixiaoxiao \n- [ ] |   |   |-- test_simple_buffer.py https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1531\n- [ ] |   |   |-- test_simple_connector.py https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1531\n- [ ] |   |   |-- test_simple_pipe.py https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1531\n- [ ] |   |   `-- test_utils.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_llmdatadist_connector.py\n- [x] |   `-- test_parallel_state.py   @wangyanhui-cmss https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1460\n- [ ] |-- test_envs.py\n- [ ] |-- lora\n- [ ] |   `-- punica_wrapper @hongfugui\n- [ ] |       `-- test_punica_npu.py @hongfugui\n- [ ] |-- models\n- [ ] |   |-- test_deepseek_dbo.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_deepseek_mtp.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_deepseek_v2.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_qwen2_5_vl.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_qwen2_5_vl_without_padding.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_qwen2_vl.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_qwen3_moe.py\n- [ ] |-- multistream\n- [ ] |   |-- test_base.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_context.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_decorator.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_layers.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_metadata.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_ms_split.py\n- [ ] |-- ops\n- [ ] |   |-- test_activation.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_attention.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_cache.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_common_fused_moe.py\n- [x] |   |-- test_expert_load_balancer.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_fused_moe.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_layernorm.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_rotary_embedding.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_vocab_parallel_embedding.py\n- [ ] |-- patch\n- [ ] |   |-- platform\n- [ ] |   |   |-- patch_0_9_1\n- [ ] |   |   |-- patch_common\n- [ ] |   |   |   `-- test_test_patch_distributed.py\n- [ ] |   |   `-- patch_main\n- [ ] |   `-- worker\n- [ ] |       |-- patch_0_9_1\n- [ ] |       |-- patch_common\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_distributed.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_eagle.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_minicpm.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_multi_step_worker.py\n- [x] |       |   |-- test_patch_sampler.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_spec_decode_worker.py\n- [ ] |       |   `-- test_patch_utils.py\n- [ ] |       `-- patch_main\n- [ ] |-- test_platform.py @zhanghw0354 https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/1476\n- [ ] |-- quantization\n- [ ] |   |-- test_func_wrapper.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_quant_config.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_quantizer.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_w8a8.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_w8a8_dynamic.py\n- [ ] |-- sample\n- [ ] |   |-- ops\n- [ ] |   `-- test_rejection_sampler.py\n- [x] |-- test_utils.py\n- [ ] `-- worker \n- [ ] |-- test_cache_engine.py @machenglong2025\n- [ ] |-- test_draft_model_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_model_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_model_runner_v1.py\n- [ ]  |-- test_mtp_proposer_v1.py @machenglong2025\n- [ ] |-- test_multi_step_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_multi_step_worker.py\n- [ ] |-- test_pooling_model_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_worker.py @zhanghw0354\n- [ ] `-- test_worker_v1.py @zhanghw0354\n",

      "comments" : [ "# :wave: Important: PLEASE READ :wave:\n\nThis issue has been labeled as a **good first issue** and is available for anyone to work on.\n\nIf this is your first time contributing to an open source project, some aspects of the development process may seem unusual, arcane, or some combination of both.\n\n1.  **You cannot \"claim\" issues.** People new to open source often want to \"claim\" or be assigned an issue before beginning work. The typical rationale is that people want to avoid wasted work in the event that someone else ends up working the issue. However, this practice is not effective in open source, as it often leads to \"issue squatting\", in which an individual asks to be assigned, is granted their request, and then never ends up working on the issue. Accordingly, you are encouraged to communicate your intent to address this issue, ideally by providing a rough outline as to how you plan to address the issue or asking clarifying questions, but, at the end of the day, we will take running code and rough consensus in order to move forward quickly.\n2.  **We have a very high bar for contributions.** We have very high standards for contributions and expect all contributions—whether new features, tests, or documentation—to be rigorous, thorough, and complete. Once a pull request is merged into stdlib, that contribution immediately becomes the collective responsibility of all maintainers of stdlib. When we merge code into stdlib, we are saying that we, the maintainers, commit to reviewing subsequent changes and making bugfixes to the code. Hence, in order to ensure future maintainability, this naturally leads to a higher standard of contribution.\n\nBefore working on this issue and opening a pull request, please read the project's [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md). These guidelines and the associated [development guide](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/docs/contributing/development.md) provide important information, including links to stdlib's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), license policy, and steps for setting up your local development environment.\n\nTo reiterate, we **strongly** encourage you to refer to our contributing guides **before** beginning work on this issue. Failure to follow our guidelines significantly decreases the likelihood that you'll successfully contribute to stdlib and may result in automatic closure of a pull request without review.\n\nSetting up your local development environment is a critical first step, as doing so ensures that automated development processes for linting, license verification, and unit testing can run prior to authoring commits and pushing changes. If you would prefer to avoid manual setup, we provide pre-configured [development containers](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/tree/develop/.devcontainer) for use locally or in GitHub Codespaces.\n\nWe place a high value on consistency throughout the stdlib codebase. We encourage you to closely examine other packages in stdlib and attempt to emulate the practices and conventions found therein.\n\n-   If you are attempting to contribute a new package, sometimes the best approach is to simply copy the contents of an existing package and then modify the minimum amount necessary to implement the feature (e.g., changing descriptions, parameter names, and implementation).\n-   If you are contributing tests, find a package implementing a similar feature and emulate the tests of that package.\n-   If you are updating documentation, examine several similar packages and emulate the content, style, and prose of those packages.\n\nIn short, the more effort you put in to ensure that your contribution looks and feels like stdlib—including variables names, bracket spacing, line breaks, etc—the more likely that your contribution will be reviewed and ultimately accepted. We encourage you to closely study the codebase **before** beginning work on this issue.\n\n:sparkles: Thank you again for your interest in stdlib, and we look forward to reviewing your future contributions. :sparkles:\n" ],

My DAG configs were: retries=1000, retry_delay=5 min (300 seconds), max_retry_delay=1h (3600 seconds). My DAG failed ~1000 times and after that Scheduler broke down. After that retries exceeded 1000 and stopped on 1017 retry attempt. \n\nI did my research on this problem and found that this happened due to formula **min_backoff = math.ceil(delay.total_seconds() * (2 ** (self.try_number - 1)))** in **taskinstance.py** file. So retry_exponential_backoff has no limit of try_number and during calculations it can overflow max Float value. So even if max_retry_delay is set formula is still calculating. And during calculations on very large retry number it crashes.\n\nPlease fix bug. \n\nI also did pull request with my possible solution:\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/48057\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/48051\n\nFrom Airflow logs:\n2024-12-09 02:16:39.825\tOverflowError: cannot convert float infinity to integer\n2024-12-09 02:16:39.825\t    min_backoff = int(math.ceil(delay.total_seconds() * (2 ** (self.try_number - 2))))\n2024-12-08 09:29:14.583\t[2024-12-08T06:29:14.583+0000] {scheduler_job_runner.py:705} INFO - Executor reports execution of mydag.spark_submit run_id=manual__2024-11-02T10:19:30.618008+00:00 exited with status up_for_retry for try_number 470\n\nConfigs: \n_with DAG(\n            dag_id=DAG_ID,\n            start_date=MYDAG_START_DATE,\n            schedule_interval=\"@daily\",\n            catchup=AIRFLOW_CATCHUP,\n            default_args={\n                'depends_on_past': True,\n                \"retries\": 1000,\n                \"retry_delay\": duration(minutes=5),\n                \"retry_exponential_backoff\": True,\n                \"max_retry_delay\": duration(hours=1),\n            },\n    ) as dag:_\n\n<img width=\"947\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3307b23-0307-4b4d-b968-3e1984fbe93c\" />\n<img width=\"1050\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f161329c-155c-4d92-b3b4-cf442d6ed036\" />\n\n### What you think should happen instead?\n\nMy pull request: \nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/48057\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/48051\n\n### How to reproduce\n\nUse configs from above.

      "description" : "# \uD83C\uDF1F Open Call for Contributions: Gemma 3n Recipes \uD83D\uDC8E\n\nHello community! \uD83D\uDC4B\n\nWe got really excited last week with the full release of [Gemma 3n](https://huggingface.co/blog/gemma3n) \uD83D\uDC8E by Google DeepMind. With that, we’d like to open this call for contributions to explore the amazing recipes the community can build with it!\n\nThis project follows the same principles as our previous [Hugging Face Llama Recipes](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface-llama-recipes), which you might also want to check out. You can refer to that repository to see the previous [call for contributions](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface-llama-recipes/issues/43) and discover what the community created. You may also want to browse the [Gemma Cookbook](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemma-cookbook) for further inspiration.\n\n> Star the project to boost it! :star:\n\n## \uD83D\uDCA1 What You Could Build\n\nGemma 3n is specifically designed for low-resource (on-device) environments and is a **multimodal model** that supports text, image, video, and audio inputs — so we’d love to see projects where those capabilities shine! ✨ We highly recommend checking out the [blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/gemma3n) to better understand the possibilities and spark your creativity.\n\nYou could:\n- Showcase agentic or interactive uses of the model\n- Build recipes using `transformers`, `llama.cpp`, or `transformers.js`\n- Create fine-tuning notebooks for domain-specific tasks using any of the supported modalities\n- Or anything else that pushes the boundaries of on-device and multimodal AI! \uD83E\uDD16\n\nHave your own idea?\uD83D\uDCA1 Even better, we’d love to hear it!\n\n## \uD83D\uDCDD How to Contribute\n\n1. **Open a New Issue**\n   - If you’re interested in contributing, please [open a new issue](#) with a descriptive title.\n   - Use the issue to outline your idea and gather early feedback.\n\n2. **Let Us Know**\n   - Comment on this post to let us know you’ve opened a new issue. We’ll update the main list with a link to your idea.\n\n3. **Start Building**\n   - Once you’ve shaped your plan, go ahead and implement your idea \uD83D\uDC68‍\uD83D\uDCBB.\n\n4. **Submit a Pull Request**\n   - When you’re ready, open a Pull Request (PR) that links back to your issue.\n   - Mention the issue in your PR description so it's easy to track.\n\n5. **Update the README**\n   - Don’t forget to add a short description of your contribution to the `README.md`, so others can find and reuse it easily.\n\n## \uD83D\uDCAC For New Contributors\n\nIf you’re just starting out in open source, we recommend reading our [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface-gemma-recipes/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md). It includes helpful tips to get you up and running.\n\nWe can’t wait to see what we’ll build together! \uD83E\uDD20\n",

      "description" : "### Summary\n\nPreviously, the wasmedge-ffmpeg plugin used ffmpeg 6.0, which is already EOL. It's not possible to ask our users to install a legacy version of ffmpeg, especially since it will require users to build from the source.\n\nTo fix this, we have to decide to use the latest LTS version, 7.1, which is in active maintenance mode.\n\nI believe API changes will be between the current version, 6.0.0, and the new version (7.1.1). So, the current implementation of the wasmedge-ffmpeg plugin will also need to be modified.\n\n\n### Details\n\nThe following action items should be finished:\n\n- [ ] Update to the new ffmpeg version 7.1.1\n- [ ] Modify the implementation of wasmedge-ffmpeg\n- [ ] Ensure the CI passes for building and testing\n\n### Appendix\n\n_No response_",

This occurs in both desktop and iOS versions, but on desktop you can use \"Print to PDF\" as a workaround.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nPDFs with blob-type URLs: are typically generated upon user request (e.g., when clicking a button). My file is from an area reserved to registered users and I cannot share the URL.\n\n### Actual result\n\n- In the desktop version (I use Windows) the \"Save As\" command in context menu is disabled and CTRL+S does not work\n- On iOS, “Save to File” is missing from the share menu because the file is shared as link only.\n\n### Expected result\n\n- On desktop, the \"Save as\" command should be available, if possible. Other Chromium browsers have the same behavior as Brave, while Firefox can download the document normally.\n- On iOS, Safari can download the file because the share menu mode is “1 document and 1 link” and Save to File is available. Brave should probably implement this feature in the same way as Safari.\n\n### Reproduces how often\n\nEasily reproduced\n\n### Brave version\n\n1.78\n\n### Device/iOS version\n\niPhone, iOS 18.5\nWindows 11\n\n### Affected browser versions\n\n- [ ] latest AppStore\n- [ ] latest TestFlight\n- [ ] previous TestFlight\n\n### Reproducibility\n\n- [ ] with Brave Shields disabled\n- [ ] in the latest version of mobile Safari\n\n### Miscellaneous information\n\n_No response_",

This is the GMS change I made to make that work: https://github.com/dolthub/go-mysql-server/pull/3046, but I realized that this was breaking a bunch of tests in Dolt for reasons I didn't expect, so I reverted it shortly thereafter: https://github.com/dolthub/go-mysql-server/pull/3056\n\nChanging the output of SET by itself will break many changes test in Dolt. Unfortunately I was actually trying to fix this issue, which is about the shell printing the right updates, so that got all jumbled up which let to a deeper issue which is that the `dolt sql` shell doesn't have the right information to determine when to print the Query OK line. Specifically, mysql shell will not print any of them if it's executing statements in a batch.\n\nThis is best shown here:\n\n```\n$ echo \"create table t (i int); drop table t;\" | mysql -u root -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3306 mydb\n$ mysql -u root -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3306 mydb\nWelcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \\g.\nYour MySQL connection id is 9\nServer version: 8.0.33 Dolt\n\nCopyright (c) 2000, 2023, Oracle and/or its affiliates.\n\nOracle is a registered trademark of Oracle Corporation and/or its\naffiliates. Other names may be trademarks of their respective\nowners.\n\nType 'help;' or '\\h' for help. Type '\\c' to clear the current input statement.\n\nmysql> create table t (i int);\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> drop table t;\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql>\n```\n\nYou can see that the output of the first command is empty. MySQL client knows that you are not in an interactive terminal. `dolt sql` shell doesn't actually know this, and as a result the changes I made to the shell break lots of tests because where ever we stream in statements, we print out `Query OK` in many places that aren't expected in tests.\n\nThe equivalent dolt operations:\n```\n$ echo \"create table t (i int); drop table t;\" | dolt sql\n\n\n$ dolt sql\n# Welcome to the DoltSQL shell.\n# Statements must be terminated with ';'.\n# \"exit\" or \"quit\" (or Ctrl-D) to exit. \"\\help\" for help.\nmydb/main> create table t (i int);\nEmpty set (0.01 sec)\n\nmydb/main*>  drop table t;\nEmpty set (0.01 sec)\n\nmydb/main>\n```\n\nAs you can see, there are empty lines printed in the pipe case, and \"Empty Set\" returned in the shell case. The changes proposed by James in https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/pull/9291 and ultimately what claude tried to do don't toggle based on if the input is a pipe or interactive, and as a result will always print `Query OK` - which is not only confusing, but breaks my dolt tests which don't expect them to be there\n\nNext Steps:\n - Get `dolt sql` wise to the way it's being operated. This may require looking at the mysql shell code, or something else. One way or another we need to be aware of when printing these things makes sense.\n - Apply the SET change to GMS, and isolate it to fixing tests only in Dolt and Doltgres. Don't modify the shell output at this stage because it breaks a lot of tests and become intractable.\n -  Update the shell, in the way proposed by James, to get the right information out in the right context.\n\nIn some of these changes, we are going to want to toggle behavior with an environment flag such that we won't stop the development train with broken builds. We kind of need better options to optionally enable behaviors while also getting them in the pipeline for testing.", "Seems like our output for `INSERT` differs from mysql as well\n\nmysql\n```\nmysql> create table enum_table (i int primary key, e enum('a','b'));\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)\n\nmysql> insert into enum_table values (1, 'a'), (2, 'b');\nQuery OK, 2 rows affected (0.01 sec)\nRecords: 2  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0\n\nmysql> create table uv (u int primary key, v varchar(10));\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)\n\nmysql> insert into uv values (0, 'bug'), (1, 'ant');\nQuery OK, 2 rows affected (0.00 sec)\nRecords: 2  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0\n```\n\ndolt\n```\ntmp/main*> create table enum_table (i int primary key, e enum('a','b'));\ntmp/main*> insert into enum_table values (1, 'a'),(2,'b');\nQuery OK, 2 rows affected (0.00 sec)\ntmp/main*> create table uv (u int primary key, v varchar(10));\ntmp/main*> insert into uv values(0, 'bug'),(1,'ant');\nQuery OK, 2 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n```" ],

It seems a little unorthodox to be creating a status bar in this way (running tail on a text file).", "@samerickson Your screenshot shows exactly the issue. You should only see the last line, \"sizth line\" as the status.\r\n\r\n### What I'm trying to achieve\r\n\r\nStatus command may want to output information as soon as it's available. If shortly after that another piece of information is available, it will output another line. Normally, it works fine. Only if multiple updates happened during the bar startup, both old and new status appear together.\r\n\r\nAs an example, my program is affected. https://github.com/shibe2/sklt", "I misunderstood the issue, I thought you were having multiple status bars. Status bars will display newline characters inline. This is useful if you want something like `lsblk` to be displayed, which is normally a block of text, but in a status bar, you need that information to be in a single line. \r\n\r\nIn your case, if you are trying to only display the last line of the file, you need to change your tail command. Tail defaults to showing the last 10 lines of a file, to make it display **Only** the last line, use: `tail -n 1`. \r\n\r\nAs for getting your project to function correctly, I have created an issue https://github.com/shibe2/sklt/issues/1, as I cannot seem to make your project function. ", "You can change your bar config to link to a script containing the following:\r\n```\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\nwhile true;\r\n    printf \"%s %s\\n\" \"$(date +%D)\" \"$(date +%r)\"\r\n    sleep 1\r\ndone\r\n```\r\nAs for getting it to display the current keyboard layout, you can have a look at this project as well:\r\nhttps://gitlab.com/racy/sway-keyboard-layout/blob/master/sway-keyboard-layout. This makes your code footprint a lot smaller, but I am unsure of the resource consumption differences. \r\n", "Thanks for your prompt reply on the `sklt` issue. Everything appears to work, though for the first minute you have the time listed twice. To circumvent this, it would be best to remove the date in your project its self, rather than trying to remove it using command-line utilities such as `tail`", "> Status bars will display newline characters inline. This is useful if you want something like lsblk to be displayed, which is normally a block of text, but in a status bar, you need that information to be in a single line.\r\n\r\nThis is not useful with *line protocol*, where each line is a new status. But even if it was useful, it is currently inconsistent: if the command outputs multiple lines immediately, they appear together; but if it does after some delay, only the last line appears.\r\n\r\n> In your case, if you are trying to only display the last line of the file, you need to change your tail command.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, my `tail` example is purely for reproduction of the issue.\r\n\r\nI also have a program that only outputs time. It uses less resources and it is more precise than a simple script. I.e. the time on screen updates almost exactly when the second changes on the computer clock.\r\n\r\nAs for your suggestion about keyboard layout, it seems to use `xkblayout` command, and I can't find it in Arch Linux repositories. Also, I tried to use X protocol for getting the current keyboard layout, but the change notification did not work under Wayland. And polling requires a compromise between CPU usage and indicator lag, so I'd like to avoid it. With Sway 1.2 it is possible to get proper notifications about keyboard layout switching, which I used in my program.", "This seems like an easy fix for anyone interested; just add some logic here: https://github.com/swaywm/sway/blob/master/swaybar/status_line.c#L117 to find the last line that was read.", "@ianyfan, for testing purposes, how can I get my built (but not installed) sway branch to stop using the system `swaybar`? Doesn't seem to respect $PATH", "It should use PATH. You can also set `swaybar_command`.", "Or start it manually.

Based on what I understood from the issue and the comment above, I believe I solved the issue with the following code (starting from https://github.com/swaywm/sway/blob/master/swaybar/status_line.c#L114):\n\n```\t\t\n\t\tsway_log(SWAY_DEBUG, \"Using text protocol.\");\n\t\tstatus->protocol = PROTOCOL_TEXT;\n\t\t// Gets starting address (relative to buffer) of last line on file\n\t\tsize_t i;\n\t\tsize_t lastline = i = 0;\n\t\twhile(status->buffer[i] != '\\0' && i <= status->buffer_size) {\n\t\t\tif(status->buffer[i] == '\\n' && status->buffer[i+1] != '\\0') {\n\t\t\t\tlastline = i + 1;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\ti++;\n\t\t}\n\t\tstatus->text = status->buffer + lastline; // <== ASSIGN HERE\n\t\t// intentional fall-through\n\tcase PROTOCOL_TEXT:\n\t\twhile (true) {\n\t\t\tif (status->buffer[read_bytes - 1] == '\\n') {\n\t\t\t\tstatus->buffer[read_bytes - 1] = '\\0';\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\terrno = 0;\n\t\t\tread_bytes = getline(&status->buffer,\n\t\t\t\t\t&status->buffer_size, status->read);\n\t\t\tif (errno == EAGAIN) {\n\t\t\t\tclearerr(status->read);\n\t\t\t\treturn true;\n\t\t\t} else if (errno) {\n\t\t\t\tstatus_error(status, \"[error reading from status command]\");\n\t\t\t\treturn true;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tstatus->text = status->buffer;    // <== REASSIGN HERE\n\t\t}\n\tcase PROTOCOL_I3BAR:\n\t\tstatus->text = status->buffer;  // <== REASSIGN HERE\n\t\treturn i3bar_handle_readable(status);\n\n```\n\nNotice I had to reassign status->text three times in the code, otherwise the pointer would get stuck and the output wouldn't update correctly (obviously I would remove the comments in upper case on PR). \nI believe the logic here is correct, but is the code appropriate for merging?  And if not, how would I write the code to be more secure/appropriate to the project?\nSince this would be my first time contributing, and I didn't find any specifications on how to do so, I figured it would be better to ask than to bother anyone with phony PRs. \nThank you!" ],

      "description" : "# Migrate remaining CLI input methods to use @clack/prompts for consistency\n\n## \uD83C\uDFAF Summary\n\nCurrently, the CLI uses a mix of input libraries (`inquirer`, Bun's global `prompt()`, and `@clack/prompts`). We should standardize on `@clack/prompts` for a consistent user experience and better styling across all CLI interactions.\n\n## \uD83D\uDCCB Current State\n\nMost of the CLI already uses `@clack/prompts` properly, but there are **2 main files** still using other input methods:\n\n### 1. `src/utils/plugin-creator.ts` - Using `inquirer` \uD83D\uDCE6\n\nThis file has multiple `inquirer.prompt()` calls that need to be migrated:\n\n- **Plugin specification collection** (~line 172-290):\n  - Plugin name input\n  - Plugin description input  \n  - Plugin features input\n  - Component selection (checkbox)\n  - Action names input\n  - Provider names input\n  - Evaluator names input\n  - Service names input\n\n### 2. `scripts/generate-unit-tests.ts` - Using global `prompt()` \uD83D\uDD27\n\n- **Test generation confirmation** (~line 165):\n  ```typescript\n  const answer = prompt('Generate tests? (y/n): ');\n  ```\n\n## ✨ Benefits of Migration\n\n1. **Consistent UX** - All CLI interactions will have the same look and feel\n2. **Better styling** - Clack provides superior visual design and animations\n3. **Better error handling** - Clack has built-in cancellation handling\n4. **Reduced dependencies** - Can remove `inquirer` from package.json\n5. **Type safety** - Better TypeScript integration\n\n## \uD83D\uDD27 Implementation Examples\n\n### For `plugin-creator.ts`:\n\n**Before (inquirer):**\n```typescript\nconst answers = await inquirer.prompt([\n  {\n    type: 'input',\n    name: 'name',\n    message: 'Plugin name (without \"plugin-\" prefix):',\n    validate: (input: string) => input.length > 0 || 'Plugin name is required'\n  }\n]);\n```\n\n**After (clack):**\n```typescript\nconst name = await clack.text({\n  message: 'Plugin name (without \"plugin-\" prefix):',\n  validate: (input) => input.length > 0 ? undefined : 'Plugin name is required'\n});\n\nif (clack.isCancel(name)) {\n  clack.cancel('Operation cancelled.');\n  process.exit(0);\n}\n```\n\n### For `generate-unit-tests.ts`:\n\n**Before:**\n```typescript\nconst answer = prompt('Generate tests? (y/n): ');\n```\n\n**After:**\n```typescript\nconst answer = await clack.confirm({\n  message: 'Generate tests?',\n  initialValue: true\n});\n\nif (clack.isCancel(answer)) {\n  console.log('Cancelled.');\n  return;\n}\n```\n\n## ✅ Reference Files (Already Using Clack)\n\nThese files are already properly implemented and serve as good examples:\n- `src/commands/create/actions/creators.ts`\n- `src/commands/create/index.ts`\n- `src/commands/env/actions/edit.ts`\n- `src/commands/publish/utils/validation.ts`\n- `src/utils/cli-prompts.ts`\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Replace all `inquirer.prompt()` calls in `plugin-creator.ts` with clack equivalents\n- [ ] Replace global `prompt()` call in `generate-unit-tests.ts` with clack\n- [ ] Remove `inquirer` dependency from `package.json` if no longer used elsewhere\n- [ ] Ensure all prompts handle cancellation properly (ctrl+c)\n- [ ] Test plugin creation flow works identically to current behavior\n- [ ] Test unit test generation script works identically to current behavior\n- [ ] Maintain existing validation logic and error messages\n- [ ] Update any related TypeScript types if needed\n\n## \uD83C\uDFAF Priority\n\n**Medium** - This improves developer experience and code consistency but doesn't affect core functionality.\n\n## \uD83D\uDCA1 Implementation Notes\n\n- The `generate-unit-tests.ts` part would be a good **beginner-friendly** task\n- The `plugin-creator.ts` part is more complex due to multiple sequential prompts\n- Consider breaking this into two separate PRs if needed\n- Make sure to test the checkbox selection for component types in plugin creation\n\n---\n\n**Note**: The majority of the CLI already uses clack properly - this is just cleaning up the last few stragglers to ensure complete consistency across the entire CLI experience.",

Ensures both dates are present.\r\n2. Resulting type of `[string, string]` instead of `string[]` prevents certain type errors.\r\n3. Elements could have different types (not relevant in this example).\r\n\r\nJust an example there are obviously many others.</div>",

The second step is good because it's really independent of the lowering method, so all the IR construction logic can be shared across all lowering options.",

      "comments" : [ "Wondering if it makes sense to convert some of these. Specifically the two I added:\n- `GetStructField`: DataFusion has a similar `get_field` already we could use, but it operates by field name instead of index, so it has to find the right field by name for each batch which adds some overhead, which is some of the downside it seems to the UDFs over logical and physical expressions which can optimize these cases at analysis time. Implementing a custom ScalarUDF also doesn't really make sense because as a user you would never select a nested field by index, always by name.\n- `GetArrayStructFields`: There's no equivalent DataFusion expression AFAIK, but the same thing above applies where there's not really a use cases for using this function directly, Spark just creates this at analysis time from an `ExtractValue` operation", "@Kimahriman what you say makes sense. For `GetStructField` and `GetArrayStructFields` it may not be useful to convert to ScalarUDFImpl" ],

This can be fixed by just writing `return`. In an arrow function you cannot do this. I guess that is why the unicorn eslint plugin introduced that option I meantioned. ", "so your suggestion @atheck is to add `checkArrowFunctionBody` option thanks", "I don't feel like we've clearly established the use case that requires adding this option. Is it just so we can let users write empty functions and not conflict with `noEmptyBlockStatements`?\n\nAlso regarding return in an arrow function, you should be able to do this:\n```\n() => { return; }\n```", "I think we could make an exception for `() => undefined`. In other cases of the rules the action can simply remove `undefined`, while here it is not the case, we have to turn it into `{}`. And to avoid triggering `noEmptyBlock` this should even be `{ return; }`, `{ ; }`, or `{ /* undefined value */ }` that look hacky.", "@Conaclos I agree. ", "Actually I even wonder if we should not always allow `return undefined`. This is a bit a stretch, however I find that `retrun;` and `return undefined;` convey different meaning: the first indicates an early return in a function that doesn't return any value (`fn(): void`), while the second one indicates a function that explicitly return the `undefined` value (`fn(): something | undefined`).\nFor example cases like this looks totally fine to me:\n\n```js\nexport function literalVal(literal: Literal): LiteralVal {\n    switch (literal.type) {\n        case \"bigint\":\n            return BigInt(literal.val)\n        case \"number\":\n        case \"string\":\n            return literal.val\n        case \"false\":\n            return false\n        case \"null\":\n            return null\n        case \"true\":\n            return true\n        case \"undefined\":\n            return undefined\n    }\n}\n```\n\nHowever, this could make the rule very different from its unicorn source.\n\nAlso, `useGetterReturn` doesn't accept `return;`, only `return <something>`, including `return undefined` that got flagged by `noUselessUndefined`.", "Yes, I also agree to that. So, noUselessUndefined would only check parameters I guess. ", "will unasign myself from this\nmy personal approach on these Is to use use lodash (rxjs) etc -> noop function for such scenarios, not a fan of () => {return;} or () => {;}\nPossibly better to leave it without auto fix? and user decides how to deal with it?" ],

      "description" : "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\nWhen I initially opened Mbin on mobile (fedia) I knew my first stop was to subscribe to a bunch of communities so my feed comes to life with interesting stuff.\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/023f234c-20ac-4df1-a191-c308af1b3aae\n\n1. Clicking on search I was hoping that I would see at the top of the results a name match result for the \"Montreal\" community\n2. I realized that the term \"Magazine\" means community after clicking on it and looking at the list\n3. Went to search and typed in the name of a city to try to find that the community I know I've seen on Lemmy but the community didn't open.\n4. Searched for a string to open the community, realized there must be some over way to search for the community at this point but figured this would work\n5. The community opens and then I went on a hunt for a subscribe button, finding it in the menu on the side\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nThere are a few ways to handle this, seems like anything helps\n- [ ] (1) An exact string match for a community (less the domain) seems like it could show a \"Community Results\" box that show \"Communities matching your result\". It would contain one or two results and have a \"view more\" link at the bottom if people are in serious onboarding mode and looking to add a lot of related communities \"montreal_food\" and \"montreal_housing\" etc.\n- [ ] (2) The term Magazine has become confusing, especially now that we are federated and viewing /c/ urls for Communities in Lemmy and PieFed. It's easy to get overwhelmed/confused with fediverse software and that step of \"Oh, this is a community... I think... maybe it's a superset, maybe it's a subset, OK note to self this is probably a community\" I'm not seeing the benefit, I can definitely see and have experienced the barrier.\n- [ ] (3) The autocomplete for this is excellent, but I was hoping if a community was selected and the text field above left blank that the \"Community Result\" search box would show up with the community to \"go to the community\"\n- [ ] (4) Maybe allowing a blank search term just shows the latest posts for the community, or goes to the community if it has been selected?\n- [ ] (5) I would suggest a very compact community header that has the name, logo/background image and a subscribe/unsubscribe button and a button to \"expand\" it to show everything. It's hard to know that you are actually on a community and I really only found that I could subscribe by chance. Under the hamburger menu I just don't expect to find elements related to inline content. That's where I expect to find search tools, DMs, profile settings perhaps.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nDetailed above.\n\n** Additional Context **\nI'm a brand new user to Mbin who users Lemmy, Reddit and Piefed so I though I would just note the pain points I hit before I learn the software and stop seeing them. Hope this is helpful and not too annoying.",

Being on mobile the magazine search is not that easy to find, as the header links are hidden in the menu (what you called \"hamburger menu\"), but on desktop you'll see this: \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6dd3f84a-59c8-4031-bf71-0b20648279e0)\n\nThe box that you filled in is an additional filter for the search term, not intended to work on its own. But maybe it should be.\n\nThe magazine panel is only hidden in the menu on mobil, on desktop it looks something like this: \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8b92cc7-28ac-44cb-84ad-70fec82ed8b9)\n\nAnd the indicator that you are in a magazine gets hidden on mobile...\n\nSo things to fix this issue in my opinion:\n- [ ] Add an indicator on mobile that you are inside of a magazine. Preferably use the one already in the header and do not hide it on mobile\n- [ ] Add magazines to the results of the \"normal\" search" ],

      "description" : "### Apache Airflow Provider(s)\n\nsftp, ssh\n\n### Versions of Apache Airflow Providers\n\napache-airflow-providers-sftp==5.3.0\napache-airflow-providers-ssh==4.1.0\n\n### Apache Airflow version\n\n2.11.0\n\n### Operating System\n\nRHEL 8.8 x86_64\n\n### Deployment\n\nVirtualenv installation\n\n### Deployment details\n\nThe deployment is a standard Celery-based one, no other special configuration used.\n\n### What happened\n\nThe issue can be reproduced as follows:\n\n- define a simple DAG that uses the SFTP sensor to check if a file exists (i.e. /etc/fstab on Linux)\n- if the connection is direct, that is without any proxy in the middle, the sensor works well\n- if the connection uses a network proxy, the sensor goes in error during execution.\n\n### What you think should happen instead\n\nInvestigating further this issue, we discovered that the version of the SFTP providers used (5.3.0) is using an auto connection closing logic, that is when no software action is ongoing the SFTP and the undergoing SSH connections are closed (providers/sftp/hook/sftp.py):\n\n```\n    def get_managed_conn(self) -> Generator[SFTPClient, None, None]:\n        \"\"\"Context manager that closes the connection after use.\"\"\"\n        if self._sftp_conn is None:\n            ssh_conn: SSHClient = super().get_conn()\n            self._ssh_conn = ssh_conn\n            self._sftp_conn = ssh_conn.open_sftp()\n        self._conn_count += 1\n\n        try:\n            yield self._sftp_conn\n        finally:\n            self._conn_count -= 1\n            if self._conn_count == 0 and self._ssh_conn is not None and self._sftp_conn is not None:\n                self._sftp_conn.close()\n                self._sftp_conn = None\n                self._ssh_conn.close()\n                self._ssh_conn = None\n```\n\nThis closing action causes a drop of the active socket toward the proxy. When a new action is done within the same task, this additional action tries to recreate the connection as visible into the code above. For example, the sensor creates a list of files matching the pattern - it's the first action - then it tries to read the modification time for each of them - it's the second action. This time, because the proxy command is defined as a cached property (providers/ssh/hook/ssh.py):\n\n```\n    @cached_property\n    def host_proxy(self) -> paramiko.ProxyCommand | None:\n        cmd = self.host_proxy_cmd\n        return paramiko.ProxyCommand(cmd) if cmd else None\n```\nthe new connection tries to reuse something collected from the cache that is no more valid, because the proxy command into the cache was not invalidated. From this point on the error raises.\n\n### How to reproduce\n\nDefine a DAG having a sensor like the following:\n\n```\n\tcheck_remote_file_without_pattern = SFTPSensor(\n\t\ttask_id = 'check_remote_file_without_pattern',\n\t\tsftp_conn_id = r'sftp-via-proxy',\n\t\tpath = r'/etc/fstab',\n\t\tpoke_interval = 1,\n\t\tmode = r'poke',\n\t\tretries = 0,\n\t\ttimeout = 1,\n\t\tsilent_fail = True,\n\t\tsoft_fail = True,\n\t)\n```\n\nwhere the connection sftp-via-proxy point to an SFTP host mySftpHost using a network proxy, the following example uses the connect-proxy (from $HOME/.ssh/config):\n\n```\nHost mySftpHost\n     Hostname the-sftp.example.com\n     User airflow\n     PasswordAuthentication no\n     IdentityFile /home/mot/.ssh/id_ed25519\n     ProxyCommand=/usr/bin/connect-proxy -H 192.168.1.100:8888 %h %p\n ```\n\nThe observed error should be like the following:\n\n```\n[2025-06-25, 18:42:28 CEST] {transport.py:1944} ERROR - Exception (client): ProxyCommand(\"/usr/bin/connect-proxy -H 192.168.1.100:8888 mySftpHost 22\") returned nonzero exit status: Broken pipe\n[2025-06-25, 18:42:28 CEST] {transport.py:1942} ERROR - Traceback (most recent call last):\n[2025-06-25, 18:42:28 CEST] {transport.py:1942} ERROR -   File \"/home/mot/airflow/lib/python3.12/site-packages/paramiko/proxy.py\", line 79, in send\n[2025-06-25, 18:42:28 CEST] {transport.py:1942} ERROR -     self.process.stdin.write(content)\n[2025-06-25, 18:42:28 CEST] {transport.py:1942} ERROR - BrokenPipeError: [Errno 32] Broken pipe\n[2025-06-25, 18:42:28 CEST] {transport.py:1942} ERROR - \n[2025-06-25, 18:42:28 CEST] {transport.py:1942} ERROR - During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:\n[2025-06-25, 18:42:28 CEST] {transport.py:1942} ERROR - \n[2025-06-25, 18:42:28 CEST] {transport.py:1942} ERROR - Traceback (most recent call last):\n[2025-06-25, 18:42:28 CEST] {transport.py:1942} ERROR -   File \"/home/mot/airflow/lib/python3.12/site-packages/paramiko/transport.py\", line 2180, in run\n[2025-06-25, 18:42:28 CEST] {transport.py:1942} ERROR -     self.packetizer.write_all(b(self.local_version + \"\\r\\n\"))\n[2025-06-25, 18:42:28 CEST] {transport.py:1942} ERROR -   File \"/home/mot/airflow/lib/python3.12/site-packages/paramiko/packet.py\", line 354, in write_all\n[2025-06-25, 18:42:28 CEST] {transport.py:1942} ERROR -     n = self.__socket.send(out)\n[2025-06-25, 18:42:28 CEST] {transport.py:1942} ERROR -         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n[2025-06-25, 18:42:28 CEST] {transport.py:1942} ERROR -   File \"/home/mot/airflow/lib/python3.12/site-packages/paramiko/proxy.py\", line 85, in send\n[2025-06-25, 18:42:28 CEST] {transport.py:1942} ERROR -     raise ProxyCommandFailure(\" \".join(self.cmd), e.strerror)\n[2025-06-25, 18:42:28 CEST] {transport.py:1942} ERROR - paramiko.ssh_exception.ProxyCommandFailure: ProxyCommand(\"/usr/bin/connect-proxy -H 192.168.1.100:8888 mySftpHost 22\") returned nonzero exit status: Broken pipe\n[2025-06-25, 18:42:28 CEST] {transport.py:1942} ERROR - \n[2025-06-25, 18:42:28 CEST] {ssh.py:337} INFO - Failed to connect.

In previous versions the connection remained open.\n\nI discovered that our problem occurs with apache-airflow-providers-sftp==5.1.0. \nWith the 5.0.0 everything works fine at the moment. I suspect that it is caused by this change: https://github.com/apache/airflow/commit/a9f3cbb2fb3446173d8c120e2df39e71ad44cb10\n\nUnfortunately I haven't had time to make a detailed summary of the problem and a reproducible minimal example.\n\nI hope this helps with troubleshooting", "Hello,\nSame for me. I confirm Nimo139 comment: I have the same issue from 5.3.0 to 5.1.0 and my task works again with 5.0.0.", "@Mottimo Isn't it possible to just invadate the cache for the the command when the connection closes instead? as then the connection will not be using invalid or outdated command, I will try it now and check if it works", "Hello, @Mottimo @cinhil, I created a pr, would you mind testing that it fixed the issue? as in my lab it has fixed it, and I would like to see that it resolved the issue for you too.", "Hi @Nataneljpwd, okay, I will try your PR and let you know the result", "Hi @Nataneljpwd, the PR works in the sense that the drop of the connection is no more observed. Then, for the matter of this issue, the PR fixes it.\n\nRelated to this issue there is another observation: the continuous opening/closing of the connections, done by the latest versions of the SFTP provider, appears not so efficient.

      "comments" : [ "This looks like a **straightforward bug** that should be relatively manageable to fix. The issue has a clear, reproducible problem: the search API key gets wiped out whenever settings are saved, even when modifying unrelated configuration like LLM provider settings.\n\n**What's clear from the report:**\nThe reproduction steps are well-defined - add a search API key, change any other setting, save, and the API key disappears. This suggests a classic form handling issue where either the search API key field isn't being properly included in the save operation, or there's a state management problem where the key gets overwritten during the settings update process.\n\n**Technical factors to consider:**\nThis is likely a UI/UX issue in the settings form logic. The problem could stem from a few common patterns - maybe the form is only serializing visible or \"dirty\" fields, or there's separate state management for different setting categories that aren't being merged properly. It could also be a simple oversight where the search API key field isn't included in the save payload.\n\n**What needs investigation:**\nYou'll want to examine the settings form component and trace through the save flow. Check how form data is collected, whether all fields are being included in the request, and how the backend processes the settings update. Look at the network requests when saving to see if the API key is even being sent.\n\n**Next steps:**\nStart by reproducing the issue locally, then inspect the settings save functionality in the frontend code. Check the form serialization logic and the API call that handles settings updates. This feels like the kind of bug where the fix might be adding a single field to a form data object or ensuring proper state merging.", "I'm on it! mamoodi can [track my progress at all-hands.dev](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/cd964620c9db45c08a0a4241c0e73aa4)" ],

The easiest way to ensure that would be to reuse.\n\nImplementor: If it's possible, I'd prefer not to change the 'brand' red upvoted color as it's core UI, though that's secondary to a functional UI.

      "description" : "## Issue: KYC Modal Integration and Flow Assembly\n\nWelcome aboard. We're glad to have you contributing to **KindFi**, a Web3 crowdfunding platform for real-world impact. This issue involves assembling and connecting the full KYC verification process in the KindFi modal component. This is a key milestone before we integrate with the live KYC server.\n\n---\n\n### Background\n\nAll five components for the KYC process have been implemented individually in issues #192, #193, #194, #195, #196. However, these components are not yet connected in a seamless flow within the modal. Your task is to integrate them into a single cohesive user experience.\n\n---\n\n### Objectives\n\nConnect all the KYC verification steps within the modal and create necessary files, actions, and hooks to prepare for server integration.\n\n---\n\n### Tasks\n\n1. **Connect all KYC steps in the modal**:\n   - Uncomment and properly integrate the imports in `kyc-modal.tsx`\n   - Implement the full KYC step flow (Steps 1–5) with correct state transitions\n   - Ensure data flows correctly between steps and is maintained in modal state\n\n2. **Create necessary API integration files**:\n   - Create API client functions for communication with the KYC server\n   - Include error handling and retry logic\n   - Show appropriate loading and success/failure states to the user\n\n3. **Implement KYC hooks and centralized state management**:\n   - Develop a context or hook to manage overall KYC state\n   - Ensure state persistence through browser refreshes or navigation\n   - Validate inputs across all steps\n\n4. **Testing and Documentation**:\n   - Write comprehensive tests for each step and the full flow\n   - Document how the integration works for future contributors\n---\n\n### Contribution Checklist\n\n- [ ] Join our **Telegram community** to stay updated and connect with maintainers and contributors. The link is in the README. Ask here if you need it.\n- [ ] Provide an **initial update within 24 hours** of being assigned the issue.

Implement Efficient State Management\n- **Refactor State Handling:** Optimize how KYC steps are stored and retrieved to ensure better performance and maintainability.\n- **Context API/Zustand Integration:** Implement a centralized state management system using **Zustand** for consistent and efficient state updates across the verification flow.\n\n### 2. Cleanup and Prepare for Server Integration\n- **Modularize Verification Steps:** Break down KYC verification steps into reusable and composable components.\n- **Ensure Server-Readiness:** Structure the codebase to seamlessly integrate API responses and minimize refactoring when backend endpoints are available.\n- **Implement Loading and Error States:** Improve user feedback by adding clear loading indicators and error handling for each verification step.\n\n### 3. Improve Form Handling\n- **Validation Enhancements:** Retest and Ensure that KYC input fields are properly validated before submitting data to the server.\n- **Optimize API Calls:** Ensure efficient data submission.\n\n## Technical Implementation\n\n- **Framework:** Next.js 14 for optimal SSR and SSG support.\n- **State Management:** Zustand for efficient global state handling.\n- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui for consistent UI components.\n- **API Integration:** Prepare API handlers and types for seamless integration with the backend.\n\n## Timeline\n\nI plan to deliver a draft pull request within **48-72 hours**, covering:\n\n- Refactored state management for KYC verification steps.\n- Cleanup of existing verification flow to prepare for API integration.\n- Implementation of error handling, validation, and UI feedback improvements.\n\nFurther refinements will be made based on feedback and testing.\n\n## Availability\n\nI am ready to dedicate the necessary time and effort to ensure the successful and timely completion of this feature. I'm usually at work from 9am to 5pm (GMT+1) but my schedule is usually flexible, allowing for prompt communication and collaboration when needed.\n\n## Additional Information\n\nFor any further details or clarifications, feel free to reach out to me.

This involves updating the block registration for the `woocommerce/add-to-cart-form` block to include a transforms property that allows it to be converted to the new `woocommerce/add-to-cart-with-options` block.\n\nSince the new blockified `Add to Cart + Options` block does not currently use any of the attributes from the classic block, we don't need to pass any attributes during the transform. The transform can simply create a new instance of the blockified block with its default settings.\n\nIf this approach looks good, could you please assign the issue to me?\n\nThanks!", "It sounds good to me, I assigned the issue to you, @amitraj2203!", "@Aljullu I've raised a [PR](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/pull/59343) for this issue, please review it when time permits.\n\nThanks!" ],

Windows calls this \"High-Contrast Mode\"; Firefox exposes it in the \"Manage Colors\" modal of `about:preferences`.\r\n\r\nTesting on Firefox 100 on Linux: forced colors causes vote arrows to render as white squares. I imagine the problem also exists on Windows High Contrast Mode. Here's a screenshot for reference:\r\n\r\n![Comment thread in lobsters; the upvote arrow is a white rectangle over a dark background](https://seirdy.one/misc/lobsters_forced_colors.png).\r\n\r\nPossible solutions, in descending order of desirability from my perspective:\r\n\r\n- Render the upvote as an SVG. A simple static SVG-Tiny should do the trick.\r\n- Render the upvote as a plain old PNG\r\n- Render the upvote using icon fonts",

We can use a css \n>`filter` to change the color in dark mode.\n\nAn even better approach to adaptive coloring would be to just make the default vote arrows the foreground color (e.g. \"Canvas\") and slightly reduce their opacity. Dark mode text-color changes will then automatically carry over to arrow color changes, *and* it'll play very well with customizations ranging from forced-colors to custom userstyles. It'll also be easier to maintain by introducing one less dark-mode adjustment.\n\nAs for distinguishing the red arrows form the gray ones in a way that doesn't depend solely on color: that's a tricky one. Perhaps the icon itself could be altered or enlarged, or it could receive a visible CSS decoration.\n\nThe orange site has an interesting approach: it just hides the button but adds an \"unvote\" hyperlink to the comment's controls.\n\n-- \nSeirdy\n", "I was just reminded of this by the filing of 1641. Since the bug was filed, we changed how we draw the upvote arrows to use a unicode 25B2 rather than draw a shape with border/background colors.\n\n@Seirdy can you confirm if this is still an issue for you? I tried to reproduce and couldn't, but the Firefox settings UI has changed from what you describe so I'm not certain I'm testing the same thing." ],

Open a request\n2. Write something in the body\n3. Send request and see that body does **not** disappear\n4. Change to another tab (e.g. headers)\n5. Send request\n6. Change to body tab and see that body is gone\n\n**Expected behavior**\nIt should not matter which tab is open while sending a request. Body should not disappear.\n\n**Screenshots/Video**\n\n\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\n - OS: macOS\n - Version v0.1.0\n\n**Additional context**\nIt's possibly due to the request body `MonacoEditor` not being rendered. I think that the request body content is read before sending the request. If the editor is not mount however, there is no body content to send --> empty request body. Should be fixable if we do only save the request body when the body tab is actually currently open or when switching away from the body tab.\n",

Write a brief description of how you will approach the task (without using ChatGPT).\n3. Add your Telegram handler in your application (e.g., in OnlyDust or similar)\n4. Write ETA in your application\n\n\n\n## What should I do if I have a problem\n1. Try to google it before asking. Googling is taking major part of dev work \n2. If you couldn't find answer your question with Google, text your question to [dev](https://t.me/spotnet_dev/4) group with your question.\n3. Do not send DM to maintainer, it would be better and faster to ask other contributors in chat \n\n\n## How to prepare PR\n1. Check if your code [smell](https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/smells) good\n2.  Add `close #<issue number>` to link your issue with your PR\n3.  Do not commit changes which is not related to your task \n4. Check after you created PR, if you committed everything.\n\n\n## Task Description\n1. Implement CRUD methods to retrieve the data shown in the following diagram:\n\n   ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb26457a-78c3-4f47-bdc6-876f4b917848)\n\nIt will be calculated by summing the token amounts across all `user_pools` and multiplying them by their current prices, as defined in [this issue](https://github.com/djeck1432/spotnet/issues/909).\n\n2. Add a new endpoint `/admin/statistic/assets` in the [`admin.py`](https://github.com/djeck1432/spotnet/blob/main/margin/margin_app/app/api/admin.py) file to expose this data.\n3. Write tests for the new endpoint, covering both positive and negative scenarios.\n4. Verify that all CI workflows pass and the endpoint functions correctly.\n",

Schema Refactor (Supabase)\n- Identify all instances of `owner_id` across the Supabase schema (tables, relationships, foreign keys).\n- Rename the columns to `kinder_id`, preserving existing constraints.\n- Create a properly versioned SQL migration file using Supabase CLI and place it under `services/supabase/migrations/`.\n- Validate database consistency after the rename through Supabase CLI and dashboard tools.\n\n### 2. Backend Adjustments (`services/supabase`)\n- Refactor all code references to `owner_id` across query logic, types, and service utilities.\n- Ensure all affected endpoints and mutations behave as expected with the updated schema.\n\n### 3. Frontend Integration (`apps/web`)\n- Update Supabase queries, types, and hooks that reference `owner_id`.\n- Refactor relevant components or forms handling project ownership or user metadata.\n- Run and update any impacted unit tests or mocks accordingly.\n\n### 4. Documentation\n- Update schema diagrams, ERD references, and technical documentation under `docs/` to reflect the updated field naming and align with project terminology.\n\n###  Deliverables\n- Fully working PR with schema + code changes.\n- A Supabase CLI-compatible SQL migration script.\n- Clear changelog and commit breakdown.\n- Optional: Schema diff or notes for internal dev reference.\n\n**ETA:** I estimate 36–48 hours for full implementation, testing, and documentation updates.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to take it! \nHappy to help standardize and improve the DB structure.\n", "# Hi there, @4c1d-V \uD83D\uDC4B You've been assigned this issue.\n\nOne invite is waiting for you in your email.

Do not just delete the package / function, do some research first\n   * find where (which PR) the function was introduced and what was using it & why\n   * ideally find the PR in which that usage was removed without removing the function itself\n   * post your findings in the comments to validate with maintainers that it's ok to delete\n",

Searching for [NOT is:fork path:Appsrc/**.pkg](https://github.com/search?type=code&q=NOT+is%3Afork+path%3AAppsrc%2F**.pkg\n) narrows it down to effectively DataFlex source code files and provides 900+ results.\n\nGiven that there are so many file extensions in use, maybe a better initial approach could be to add support for DataFlex without specifying `extensions` or `filenames` to avoid conflicts. And DataFlex source repositories can use `.gitattributes` overrides for the relevant extensions instead. Obviously not ideal, but it would at least provide recognition for the DataFlex language, and that's a great starting point.\n\nI see there is some precedence for languages without specifying file extensions, such as for Elvish transcripts from PR #6302, which is mainly used inside markdown files. @lildude and @NilsSve, I can help and put up a PR for adding the DataFlex language without specifying any file extensions, would that work?\n" ],

Since ProbeRunner already stores this reference internally, this integration would be straightforward.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> SourceFile has no finalize/teardown lifecycle, we need to implement one and use in AstAnalyser (probably)\n\n## Example\n\nHere’s a snippet of code that would be moved into the initialize callback of the `isWeakCrypto` probe:\n\n```js\nthis.tracer = new VariableTracer()\n  .enableDefaultTracing()\n  // ↓↓↓ this part\n  .trace(\"crypto.createHash\", {\n    followConsecutiveAssignment: true, moduleName: \"crypto\"\n  });\n```\n\nWe don't need to trace `crypto.createHash` if the isWeakCrypto probe is not used.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e7dca6f-1881-423b-9fb1-ab8c55736a7a)",

However, it may be necessary for some coreth API functionality (as well as being generally helpful for testing). This could still be implemented relatively simply by amortizing the FFI calls to batch the key-value pairs to relatively few calls. This will still require some clever memory management to avoid copying too much data (idea: allocate a pool in Go?) and to enable 2D arrays in C to be translated into slices of slices in Go. Additionally, freeing the iterator may be difficult if using a literal Rust iterator. ",

      "description" : "## Description\nThe Forest Carbon user guide states that \"all spatial inputs must be in the same projected coordinate system and in linear meter units.\". The model requires, and validates, that the AOI and LULC inputs have the same coordinate reference system. However, the model data vector that we provide (which is still entered by the user as an input) does not have to be in that same CRS - it gets reprojected to match the user-provided CRS. Since we are reprojecting anyway, it seems like the model could support a different CRS between the AOI and LULC, and reproject one to match the other. \n\nBenefits would be handling reprojection for the user when possible; and potentially-less-confusing input data requirements.",

We should still decompress the file on the cloud VM though, so the user can use file mounts as usual.\r\n\r\nRelated to disk space cannot accommodating user files, it would be great to do some pre-checks and calculate its total disk space usage, and compare it to the configured disk size.

This means that, when executing the `createapp` command, new projects generated with this command use ESLint.\r\n\r\nBut the framework monorepo itself has not yet been migrated to ESLint. This is a technical debt that should be resolved.\r\n\r\n# Guidelines\r\n\r\n- ~If [this PR](https://github.com/FoalTS/foal/pull/1260), which updates the way dependencies are managed in monorepo, has not yet been merged, the new branch should be created from `v4-5-0`. Otherwise, it should be created from `master`. Not only will this facilitate the migration to ESLint, it will also avoid the need for additional work later on to manage ESLint dependencies with the new dependency system.~\r\n- Migration to ESLint should not change the style of the framework code (we don't want thousands of line changes to commit). A lot of work had been done at the time in [this PR](https://github.com/FoalTS/foal/pull/561) to make ESLint rules consistent with TSLint rules. There's probably a lot to be learned from this PR.\r\n- When opening the framework repository with VSCode with the ESLint plugin enabled, VSCode should correctly highlight ESLint errors and correct them when saving (if the plugin is configurer to do so).\r\n\r\n# Notes\r\n\r\n- There *might* be useful information [here](https://typescript-eslint.io/getting-started/typed-linting/monorepos/).\r\n- The files `packages/cli/src/generate/specs/app/.eslintrc.js` and `packages/cli/src/generate/templates/app/.eslintrc.js` used by `foal createapp` to generate new projects may cause problems.",

I'll let you choose what you think is the best solution.\n\nThe ideal solution where we want to go is this:\n- the method used in the monorepo framework should be the same as that used in new projects generated by `foal createapp`,\n- and the linting rules used in the monorepo framework should be the same as those used in new projects generated by `foal createapp`.\n\nIn this way, when we write documentation and copy-paste code from the framework, the examples are always correctly “linted” when users then copy-paste the same code into their projects.\n\n**Note 1:** if we have this ideal solution with the same rules and the `createapp` rules are still the same and there are linting errors that appear from the framework code, then we can fix them all. Go for it \uD83D\uDC4D \n\n**Note 2:** in tests of the directory `acceptance-tests/`, there are pieces of code that are between comments such as `======== DOCUMENTATION BEGIN =======` and `====== DOCUMENTATION END =======`. In this case, this means that these codes are present in the documentation and should be updated as well in the markdowns in case of modification. You can ignore files in `docs/versioned_docs/` and `docs/i18n/`.\n\nThank you so much, for taking care of this.

      "description" : "### What We Are Doing: Adding Timestamps to Videos\nAdding timestamps to the description section of the videos on [Data Umbrella YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/DataUmbrella). \n\n### Why We Are Adding Timestamps\nWhen timestamps are available:  \n1. It makes it easy for viewers to get to the part in the video they are interested in.  \n2. It also helps potential viewers find the video based on their search terms.\n\nYour helpful contribution is greatly appreciated!!\n\n### Instructions\n1.  Pick a video and indicate below the \"Event #\" and \"Video Name\" you will work on.  If you pick a video to work on,  please add a comment below, so two people are not working on the same video (avoid duplicating work).  \n1.  Watch the video and make a list of descriptive timestamps.\n1.  To submit your timestamps, there are two options:\n     - Open a new issue. Label the issue with the video speaker and title.  Add in the timestamps and notes (Markdown `txt` format) \n     - Create a pull request with the timestamps in the file indicated to add the timestamps.\n     - This is the format needed for timestamps. Any other format will require us to do extra work so we can copy and paste it into the YouTube video description.\n```\n00:00 Introduction\n10:00 example\n12:23 example\n``` \n1. Below is a list of videos that need timestamps. The video descriptions can be checked to see if the timestamps are there or not:  https://www.youtube.com/c/DataUmbrella\n\n### Extra\n1.  *Please* pick *one* video at a time.  \n1.  After you pick a video, please share the timestamps within two weeks, or sooner.  Thank you. \n\n### Examples\n- [Linked Lists event](https://github.com/data-umbrella/event-transcripts/blob/main/misc/48_clair_linked_lists.md)\n- [Probabilistic Programming with

[FastAPI](https://github.com/data-umbrella/event-transcripts/blob/main/2022/60-abdulazeez-fastapi.md)\n\n### Example PR Description\nExample PR:

Inside the task, references like {{ params.my_param }} or accessing context[\"params\"][\"my_param\"] remain unset. \n\nAlthough the UI shows the parameters form, these values never make it into the task context. \n\n### What you think should happen instead?\n\nWhen I trigger a backfill from the Airflow 3 UI and enter parameters in the Run Parameters or Advanced Options → Configuration JSON, these values should be passed to each DAG run created during the backfill.\n\nInside the DAG, I should be able to access them using:\n\t•\t{{ params.my_param }} in templates\n\t•\tcontext[\"params\"][\"my_param\"] in Python code\n\nThis is how it works when triggering a single DAG run from the UI, so the behavior should be the same for backfills. The parameters entered in the UI should override the defaults defined in the DAG and be available in all backfilled runs.\n\n### How to reproduce\n\n1.\tCreate the following DAG:\n\n```\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom airflow.decorators import dag, task\nfrom airflow.models.param import Param, ParamsDict\n\n@task\ndef test_backfill_with_params(params: ParamsDict):\n    assert params.get(\"id\") is not None\n\n@dag(\n    dag_id='test_backfill',\n    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),\n    schedule='@daily',\n    catchup=False,\n    default_args={'owner': 'Gery', 'retries': 0},\n    params={\n        \"id\": Param(default=None, title=\"My id\", description=\"My id\", type=[\"null\", \"string\"]),\n    }\n)\ndef test_backfill_dag():\n    test_backfill_with_params()\n\ntest_backfill_dag()\n```\n\n2.\tGo to the Airflow 3 UI.\n3.\tOpen the Backfill modal for the test_backfill DAG.\n4.\tSet a date range (e.g., start and end: 2025-06-01 00:00 and 2025-06-02 00:00).\n5.\tIn the Run Parameters section, set id = \"1234\".\n6.\tTrigger the backfill.\n\nExpected: The DAG run(s) should pass \"id\": \"1234\" to the task, and the assertion should pass.\nActual: The parameter is not passed, and the task fails due to params.get(\"id\") being None.\n\n### Operating System\n\nMac OS 14.6 (23G80)\n\n### Versions of Apache Airflow Providers\n\nNo providers\n\n### Deployment\n\nDocker-Compose\n\n### Deployment details\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Are you willing to submit PR?\n\n- [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n",

      "comments" : [ "Most plotting functions should handle empty vectors. I can't formulate a perfect rule but usually if you can draw zero or more of something, then this should work for zero. But if there's some data transformation inherent to a recipe which just doesn't make sense for zero elements, then this should fail. Like `sum(Float64[])` returns `0` but `mean(Float64[])` returns `NaN` because you can't divide by zero.\r\n\r\nOften, problems with zero elements will stem from type instabilities breaking subsequent dispatches. For example, a vector will be assembled given the input data and this ends up `Any[]` for the zero-element case because it couldn't be inferred what element type it should be. Then any following dispatch will probably fail if it expected `Point2f` or so. These are often reasonably easy to fix by type-constraining the relevant containers.", "@jkrumbiegel Yes, that is why I explicitely called concretely typed empty vectors, that avoids the dispatch problem I guess, at least partially.", "Right but this is not just about the input types, the recipes themselves will sometimes do type-unstable transformations. But those can be fixed one by one. We should definitely increase the test coverage for empty recipes. If you want to tackle that, it would already be very helpful to assess which empty cases are already tested, and which aren't, and then adding tests (that are failing) for the missing cases. Then somebody else can go in and fix those.", "@jkrumbiegel i hope I will have a bit of time for that but so far I've never contributed to make. I have to say I do not know how to dev it properly without breaking the rest of my environment. I know there is a section about contributions but I had surprises with previous attempts. Any suggestions? ", "Right, it's a little more complex than with other packages but not terribly so. I have a shared `@makie` environment that I activate when developing, because if you just activate the main `Makie` env directly, you'll not get `MakieCore`, and any of the backends dev'ed.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"448\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl/assets/22495855/9e02697d-1505-4898-8b8e-82cc55b197d5\">\r\n\r\nSo `]activate @makie` and then `dev Makie` should clone the whole Makie repo into your dev folder. Then you can `dev MakieCore` etc and it should find those in the Makie folder because they are subfolders of that.", "updated the opening post for what's not erroring. 2 to go", "On Makie `v0.24.2`/ CairoMakie `v0.15.2` there appear to be a few changes:\n```julia\nablines([],[]) # fails\narrows(Point3f[], Vec3f[]) # fails\narrows2d(Point2f[], Vec2f[]) # fails\narrows3d(Point3f[], Vec3f[]) # fails\nscatter(Point3f[]) # works\nband(Point3f[],Point3f[]) # works\nbarplot(Float64[],Float64[]) # works \nboxplot(Float64[],Float64[]) # works\nlines(Point3f[]) # works\nlinesegments(Point3f[]) # works\nmeshscatter(Point3f[]) # works\npie(Float64[]) # works\nscatterlines(Point3f[]) # works\ntriplot(Point3f[]) # fails deliberately\n```\n\nDifferencing with the previous status (July 2025 vs Aug 2024):\n- `ablines` fails with `reducing over an empty collection is not allowed`\n- `arrows` (deprecated) had worked but now fails with `Conversion failed for MeshScatter`\n- `arrows2d`/`arrows3d` have replaced `arrows` but fail in the same way\n- `band` now works\n- *(possibly the same as before)* `triplot` fails with `InsufficientPointsError`, so it's not supposed to work\n\nSo `ablines` and `arrows`/`arrows2d`/`arrows3d` are the ones remaining to fix." ],

It's meant to be incremented every time the rolling stock is edited. It has no business there, it's supposed to be internal to editoast, and its addition is not sound: if the version counter is supposed to be incremented when a rolling stock with a given ID changes, this field cannot meaningfully be read from disk. Clients also have no business knowing the current version.\r\n - `energy_sources` was added in [this change](https://github.com/osrd-project/osrd/pull/3811). This field is not read anywhere, and we don't know when it's going to be used. Sure, the design of this API is pretty good, and we're probably going to use it at some point, but we should have added the field as we needed it:\r\n   - even if this API seems appropriate now, it may have to change when it is finally used\r\n   - anyone actually using this field may be lead to believe that is actually makes a difference\r\n   - anyone using this field, through [hyrum's law](https://www.hyrumslaw.com/), constrain what we can do later on with this API\r\n\r\nBoth of these changes introduced [practical issues](https://github.com/osrd-project/osrd/issues/4663).\n\n### Acceptance criteria\n\n- [ ] Remove the `version` field from the RailJSON schema\r\n- [ ] Create an issue or documentation page with the Qualesi design work and proposed schema\r\n- [ ] Remove the `energy_sources` field from the RailJSON schema",

      "description" : "## Community contributions: Add Fast Image Processors\n\nFast image processors have been rolling out progressively for a while. Now that the [BaseImageProcessorFast](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/image_processing_utils_fast.py#L292), from which all fast image processors inherit, is in a more stable state, I'm opening this issue to encourage contributors to add fast image processors for models that still only have a \"slow\" image processor.\n\n### How to implement a Fast Image Processor\n\nThe core principle of fast image processors is to use `torch` and `torchvision` functions for image transformations instead of `PIL` or `numpy`. Among other performance benefits, this enables processing images on GPU, significantly improving inference speed.\n\nAnother key difference compared to slow image processors is that, unlike `BaseImageProcessor`, which provides only a minimal skeleton, `BaseImageProcessorFast` includes all the fundamental functionalities needed for a basic image processor. This allows optimizations made in BaseImageProcessorFast to propagate to its inherited classes. Additionally, most repetitive logic for image loading and argument handling is managed within BaseImageProcessorFast. Except in rare cases, inherited classes do not need to handle image loading, conversion, or retrieving arguments from class attributes in the call/preprocess function, this is all handled in `BaseImageProcessorFast`.\n\n#### Getting Started\n\nRun the following command:\n```bash\ntransformers-cli add-fast-image-processor --model-name model_name\n```\nwhere `model_name` is the name of the model (as found in its folder under `transformers/src/transformers/models`) for which you're adding the fast image processor.\n\nThis command will handle all necessary imports and generate a basic fast image processor, which will look similar to this example for Beit:\n\n```python\n# coding=utf-8\n# Copyright 2025 The HuggingFace Inc. team.

The class attributes, such as `resample` and `image_mean`, are automatically parsed from the slow image processor when running the script above. However, you should verify their correctness and check for any missing or incorrectly assigned values.\n\n### Customizing the Image Processor\n\nIf the image processor requires additional functionalities beyond the basic augmentations, you will need to override the `_preprocess` function in `BaseImageProcessorFast`. Check the `_preprocess` implementation in `BaseImageProcessorFast` for reference. Notably, it leverages `group_images_by_shape` and `reorder_images` to enable batch processing, significantly increasing processing speed, particularly on GPUs. If you create new image processing functions, ensure they support batch processing by utilizing `group_images_by_shape` and `reorder_images` where possible.\n\nIf your image processor requires additional kwargs not present in [`DefaultFastImageProcessorKwargs`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/image_processing_utils_fast.py#L172), you must create a `ModelNameFastImageProcessorKwargs` class that inherits from `DefaultFastImageProcessorKwargs` and defines the new kwargs. Additionally, you should document the added kwargs in the class and the `preprocess` function using `add_start_docstrings`. (This documentation process may be simplified soon, but is necessary for now to get a correct documentation).\n\nFor an example of handling custom kwargs and documentation, refer to [LlavaNextImageProcessorFast](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/models/llava_next/image_processing_llava_next_fast.py).\n\n### Important Notes\n\n- In nearly all cases, `_preprocess` is the only function in `BaseImageProcessorFast` that needs to be overridden.\n- The `_preprocess` function does not require default values for its arguments, as they are automatically derived from class attributes if not explicitly provided.\n- Even if `PIL` images or `numpy` arrays are passed to the image processor, the `images` argument in `_preprocess` will always be a list of tensors, with the channel dimension first.\n\n### Handling Edge Cases\n\n- **Nested Images:** If images are provided as nested lists (e.g., `[[image1, image2], [image3]]`), they will be flattened to `[image1, image2, image3]` by default before being passed to `_preprocess`. This behavior can be modified by overriding `_prepare_images_structure`, though flattening is generally recommended.\n- **Formatting Custom  Kwargs:** If any custom kwargs require formatting before `_preprocess`, override `_further_process_kwargs`.\n- **Validating Custom Kwargs:** If additional validation is needed for custom kwargs or existing ones, override `_validate_preprocess_kwargs`.\n\n### Testing\n\nIn the case where the model already has a `test_image_processing_model_name.py` file under `transformers/tests/models/model_name`, the script ran before should have imported the fast image processor to the file, and added it as a `fast_image_processing_class` class attribute to the `ModelNameImageProcessingTest` class.\nHowever this is not enough to get all the tests to run on the fast image processor. For all the test functions under `ModelNameImageProcessingTest`, you need to replace `image_processing = self.image_processing_class(**self.image_processor_dict)` with a loop over `self.image_processor_list`.\n\nFor example, the `test_image_processor_properties` test in `test_image_processing_beit.py` which looks like this:\n\n```python\n    def test_image_processor_properties(self):\n        image_processing = self.image_processing_class(**self.image_processor_dict)\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"do_resize\"))\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"size\"))\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"do_center_crop\"))\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"center_crop\"))\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"do_normalize\"))\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"image_mean\"))\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"image_std\"))\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"do_reduce_labels\"))\n```\nshould be changed to this:\n\n```python\n    def test_image_processor_properties(self):\n        for image_processing_class in self.image_processor_list:\n            image_processing = image_processing_class(**self.image_processor_dict)\n            self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"do_resize\"))\n            self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"size\"))\n            self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"do_center_crop\"))\n            self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"center_crop\"))\n            self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"do_normalize\"))\n            self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"image_mean\"))\n            self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"image_std\"))\n            self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"do_reduce_labels\"))\n```\n\nIn the case where no image processing test file is present, now is a great time to add one! You can have a look at the[ CLIP image processing test file](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/ad5d40de9c4d4899d5b79243f63e22c72e8b3669/tests/models/clip/test_image_processing_clip.py) to use as a simple starting point.\n\nDon't hesitate to add model-specific tests if you feel like there are some non-standard image processing techniques in the processor :).\n\nTo run the tests, use this command:\n```bash\nRUN_SLOW=1 python -m pytest tests/models/model_name/test_image_processing_model_name.py\n```\n\n\n### Choosing an Image Processor to Implement\n\nThe difficulty of implementing a fast image processor varies by model.

Good task for this week..!", "@edgarriba I love kornia! But for image processors at inference time, it might be a bit overkill since 90% of the time, we only need a mix of resizing, normalizing, padding, and cropping, combined with some model-specific logic. I’ve found that `torch`/`torchvision` functional transforms usually cover these needs well, and pipelines like kornia `ImageSequential` or torchvision `Compose` aren’t always a good fit because some models require additional processing steps or custom logic in between. We also wanted to avoid adding an extra dependency to Transformers for fast image processors.\n\nThat said, I do think kornia could be valuable down the line, especially for batch processing. I'm still exploring how to optimize batch processing performance on both GPU and CPU, and kornia likely handles this more efficiently than our current approach.", "The core of the library is pure functional -- that has been always the scope.

I know that those with a PR link in front of them, regardless of whether the box is ticked or not, have been fixed but how do I know those that have not been fixed, especially since some of them have their boxes ticked and some do not?

Review how `karma` can work with `vilte` or `rollup`\r\nb. Check if `parcel`, `vite` or `esbuild` can be used instead of `tsc` and what would be the gains\r\nc.

Forked and cloned the repository, then searched the codebase for `readline` usage to find the core input handling logic.\n2.  Identified `useKeypress.ts` (for raw keypress events) and `InputPrompt.tsx` (for input logic) as the key files.\n3.  To see what the application receives, I temporarily modified the code to log every keypress event to a `debug.log` file.\n4.  **Key Finding:** My initial debugging proved that on a default macOS Terminal, `Shift+Enter` sends the exact same sequence (`\\r`) as a regular `Enter` press, making the two indistinguishable.\n\n### Attempted Fix & The Final Discovery\n\nBased on the initial finding, I attempted a code-only fix by teaching the application to listen for a different key combination, `Shift+Down`, which often sends a unique sequence on other terminals.\n\n1. The Code I Tested\nI modified `useKeypress.ts` to listen for the `Shift+Down` sequence (`\\x1b[1;2B`) and `InputPrompt.tsx` to handle a `key.shift` flag.\n\n```typescript\n// In useKeypress.ts, I added a check:\nif (key.sequence === '\\x1b[1;2B') {\n  key.name = 'return';\n  key.shift = true;\n}\n```\n```typescript\n// In InputPrompt.tsx, I added the key.shift check:\nif (key.ctrl || key.meta || key.shift || charBefore === '\\\\' || key.paste) {\n  // ... newline logic\n}\n```\n\n2. The Result: It Also Failed\nThis proof-of-concept did not work. To understand why, I used the `cat` command to see what my terminal was actually sending when I pressed `Shift+Down`.\nFinal Proof: The terminal sent `^[[B`, which is the standard escape code for a plain Cursor Down key.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis investigation leads to a definitive conclusion: the default macOS Terminal is more limited than anticipated. It appears to strip the `Shift` modifier information from both the `Enter` key and the arrow keys, making a code-only fix for a `Shift+Key` newline combination unfeasible on this specific platform, although i think this might work on other platforms which by default register shift + down as '\\x1b[1;2B' but i cant really test it.\n\nThis might explain why `Ctrl+J` is a common suggested alternative, as it sends a universal newline character (`\\n`) that doesn't rely on modifier key parsing.\n\nAs this is my first contribution, my analysis could be wrong, and I apologize for the detailed-but-failed attempt. Given these findings, what is the desired path forward? Any information from the internal `b.corp.google.com` link about how other terminals are supported would still be very helpful.\n\nThank you for your time and guidance.", "Just to add, I personally use the Warp Terminal on Mac.

Even with publicKey bytes encrypted & shared, there's no constructor, similar to `secp256k1.PubKey` that help constructing publicKey from bytes!\n\n### Proposed Feature\n\nThis is related to #19285, seems closed as completed but I don't see any constructor to create secp256r1 public keys from exported bytes ( tecnically from pubKey.Bytes(). Is it implemented or any plan to implement, or any example to refer? Due to ecdsaPK unexported byte, its not possible to convert an `ecdsa.PubKey` to `secp256r1.pubKey`",

      "comments" : [ "## Why this happens:\n\n- The output geometry is different when the intersection of two shapes is rotated.  It's not just a visual glitch.  The second shape really has an (extremely thin) triangle protruding from it.\n- ***This happens because we are rotating (transforming) the coordinates of the shapes before we compute their intersections.*** *(Relevant code is [here](https://github.com/flexcompute/tidy3d/blob/f258832356daa01bc5a23e7f6ab5dd006a4d56ae/tidy3d/components/geometry/base.py#L2930).)*\n- Consequently, floating-point roundoff error due to rotation sometimes causes tiny distortions in the overlapping regions of the two shapes.  This prevents them from being subtracted correctly.\n- One way to solve this problem would be to switch the order: perform the shape intersection calculations *before* the rotation in the plane.\n- Unfortunately, there is no easy way to do that.  *(DETAILS:  This is because [shapely](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/shapely.difference.html) can only compute the intersection between 2D shapes (not 3D shapes).   To make each geometric shape in our simulation 2D, it must first be projected onto the image plane.  This is accomplished using [the `to_2D` array](https://github.com/flexcompute/tidy3d/blob/f258832356daa01bc5a23e7f6ab5dd006a4d56ae/tidy3d/components/geometry/base.py#L2920).  Unfortunately, this array *also* contains rotation information.  There's no way to *only* project onto the plane without *also* rotating the object.  So, if we are using shapely, then we have to apply the `to_2D` transformation (including rotations) first before computing the shape intersections.)*\n\n-------------------------------------------\n## Note to self:\n\n***FEEL FREE TO SKIP.  These are my own notes.***\n\n- When 3D volumetric shapes (eg: box, cylinder) are plotted in 2D, Tidy3D computes their intersection with the display plane (eg. YZ axes) *(using the `Geometry.intersections_plane()` function, which is invoked by `Geometry.plot()`)*.\n- The plots look different because the resulting shapes being displayed actually are different in the rotated and unrotated cases.\n\n**Unrotated case**: `(box-cylinder).plot(x=0)`\n\n- I checked the list of coordinates generated by that function (stored in the `shapes_intersect` variable).\n- In the 1st plot example (`(box-cylinder).plot(x=0)`), the `shapes_intersect` variable stores the coordinates of a simple rectangle (with only 4 unique points at the rectangle's corners).\n```\nshapely.get_coordinates(shapes_intersect[0])=array([\n       [-9.015, 15.   ],\n       [-9.005, 15.   ],\n       [-9.005,  9.   ],\n       [-9.015,  9.   ],\n       [-9.015, 15.   ]\n\n```\n\n**Rotated case:** `(box-cylinder).rotated(np.pi/2,axis = 0).plot(x=0)`\n\n- In the 2nd plot example the `shapes_intersect` variable has a couple extra vertices, including one located at `-5,-9.015,` which is responsible for the infinitely thin line we are seeing that extends to the right.\n```\nshapely.get_coordinates(shapes_intersect[0])=array([\n       [ -5.   ,  -9.015],  # <- problematic\n       [-10.   ,  -9.015],\n       [-15.   ,  -9.015],\n       [-15.   ,  -9.01 ],\n       [-15.   ,  -9.005],\n       [-10.   ,  -9.005],\n       [ -9.   ,  -9.005],\n       [ -9.   ,  -9.015],\n       [ -5.   ,  -9.015],  # <- problematic\n       [ -5.   ,  -9.015],  # <- problematic\n])\n```", "![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5d8d5ca-b045-4456-b174-6c9e439f752d)\n\nThe thin line that we don't want protruding from the object is actually a very thin triangle.\n\n### Possible Solution\nDiscard vertices on the polygon boundary if their absence does not affect the area of the polygon.\n\n### Question\nAm I allowed to do that?  Are objects allowed to be arbitrarily thin?  Is it okay to discard extremely thin triangles from shapely objects?", "Hi @jewettaijfc I believe we disallow polygons with small areas (near numerical precision). But maybe the area here was large enough to make the cut.\n\nhttps://github.com/flexcompute/tidy3d/blob/develop/tidy3d/components/geometry/polyslab.py#L49\n\n\n@momchilmm @lucas-flexcompute do you know how we should handle this?", "Hi Tyler!\nTo clarify: Discarding small polygons is not the same as discarding small triangles that are part of a larger polygon.  That's what I'm asking for permission to do.", "(In this case the width of the triangle was approximatley `1e-15`, which I suspect is pretty close to 64-bit precision.)\nThanks for your fast reply, @tylerflex !\n\nI am wondering if there is some way to represent infinitely thin charged sheets or current sheets in Tidy3D.  (?)  If so, if I start deleting thin triangles, I worry I might accidentally erase those.", "ok looks like `fp_eps` [here](https://github.com/flexcompute/tidy3d/blob/develop/tidy3d/constants.py#L62) is actually 1e-7 or so. so something else is going on. Maybe the other people can comment, it's been a while since I worked with this code.\n\n> I am wondering if there is some way to represent infinitely thin charged sheets or current sheets in Tidy3D. (?) If so, if I start deleting thin triangles, I worry I might accidentally erase those.\n\nWe do support these, but they are evaluated I think as lines in that `plot_shape` method.", "Great!  Then I will go ahead and remove those super-thin triangles from each polygon.\n\nI started a [new PR](https://github.com/flexcompute/tidy3d/pull/2581/) which uses this approach.\n(Warning: It is not yet complete.)\n\n*(Currently, I only bother to do this for clipped polygons.  In other words, polygons that were created by `ClipOperation.intersections_plane()` or `ClipOperation.intersections_tilted_plane()`.  If you want me do this consistently for all polygons that appear in plots, let me know.)*" ],

      "description" : "**Describe the bug and reproduction steps**\n   The chat window does not take up the full width but remains fixed-width instead. According to discussions, this fixed-width implementation might be a leftover behavior from before the container resize feature was reintroduced, which aimed to address a horizontal scrolling bug. However, this is reducing the usability of the chat window interface.\n\n**Potential solutions**\n   Ensure that the chat window dynamically takes up the full width of the available space while preventing any unwanted horizontal scrolling issues.\n\n**Logs, Errors, Screenshots, and Additional Context**\n   A relevant screenshot was attached in the Slack message, but it could not be uploaded successfully to S3.

      "description" : "\n# Issue: VacuumAgent.ipynb notebook broken due to missing simpleChatAgent function\n\n## Description\nThe VacuumAgent.ipynb notebook is broken because it attempts to use the `simpleChatAgent` function which does not exist in the current codebase. This function was likely renamed or modified in a previous iteration.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n1. Open the VacuumAgent.ipynb notebook\n2. Try to run the notebook\n3. Observe the error when it attempts to use the non-existent `simpleChatAgent` function\n\n## Potential Fix\nReplace the `simpleChatAgent` function call with direct use of the `AIAgent` constructor with a `chatAgentStrategy()`:\n\n```kotlin\n// Old code:\nval agent = simpleChatAgent(\n    executor = executor,\n    toolRegistry = toolRegistry,\n    llmModel = OpenAIModels.Chat.GPT4o,\n    systemPrompt = systemVacuumPrompt\n)\n\n// New code:\nval agentConfig = AIAgentConfig(\n    prompt = prompt(\"chat\", params = LLMParams(temperature = 1.0)) {\n        system(systemVacuumPrompt)\n    },\n    model = OpenAIModels.Chat.GPT4o,\n    maxAgentIterations = 50,\n)\n\nval agent = AIAgent(\n    promptExecutor = executor,\n    strategy = chatAgentStrategy(),\n    agentConfig = agentConfig,\n    toolRegistry = toolRegistry\n)\n```\n\nAlso update the imports to include:\n```kotlin\nimport ai.koog.agents.core.agent.AIAgent\nimport ai.koog.agents.core.agent.config.AIAgentConfig\nimport ai.koog.agents.ext.agent.chatAgentStrategy\nimport ai.koog.prompt.dsl.prompt\nimport ai.koog.prompt.params.LLMParams\n```\n\nAnd update the explanation text to mention using the `AIAgent` constructor with a chat strategy instead of the `simpleChatAgent` helper function.\n\n## Other smaller remarks about the VaccumAgent example\n1. The running agent does not print anything that confirms the agent is running well. A simple `print(env)` could be enough to show the state of the environment after the agent has run.\n\n2. It is also a little weird that the sense tool prints both the state of the current location as well as the world that contains the state of all locations. It would be more logical if the world only contained the list of existing locations without their state. The `toString()` method in `VacuumEnv` could be improved by replacing:\n\n```kotlin\noverride fun toString(): String = \"location=$location, dirtyA=${status['A']}, dirtyB=${status['B']}\"\n```\n\nWith a simpler implementation that only shows the available locations:\n\n```kotlin\noverride fun toString(): String = \"locations=${status.keys.toList()}\"\n```\n\nThis will display the locations in the format \"locations=[A, B]\" as requested, making the output cleaner and focusing only on what locations exist in the environment without revealing their state.",

To be honest, modules changing behavior based on the root module name sounds pretty scary to me.", "It's for building container images. We use the module name as a way to initialize the root folder (eg., `/whatever/<root>`). This helps avoiding conflicts and has some other benefits.\n\nCurrently in none bzlmod consumers are required to pass in a root name via workspace rule. The convention is to use the same name as workspace name. In bzlmod I have a tag_class with an attribute for this but it's superfluous. I can actually compute a sane default based on root module name. I have some other checks in place to ensure that `dev_dependency` is used. \n\nIt's more of a convenience.

      "description" : "## TLDR\n\nIn expressions, `foo/bar` bad, `./foo/bar` good\n\n## Is your feature request related to a problem?\n\nMost path literal expressions start with `./` in practice. (if not `../`)\nThis is a good practice because it makes it clear from the start what's the role of the text that follows.\n\nIn fact the use of path literal expressions like `foo/bar.nix` is sufficiently rare that experienced Nixers are unaware of this possibility (https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/413892)\n\nPerhaps the time has come to take this convention.\n\n## Proposed solution\n\n1. Add a setting to warn or fail when a relative path is encountered that does not start with a `.`\n2. After some time, default the setting to warn by default\n\nI'd stop there, so that we can keep evaluating old expressions without significant intervention.\nOpting out of an error may be hard when multiple hosts are involved in a deployment process that involves evaluation.\n\n## Alternative solutions\n\n**Linting**. This is far less effective. We want everyone to stop using this syntax, not just those who have the knowledge and headspace for it, and we want good coverage; not just the projects that have integrated tooling.\n\n## Additional context\n\n- Similar to https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/8738\n\n- A language redesign could parse `./foo/bar` as syntax sugar for `${.}/foo/bar` or `(.)/foo` or something. We can't do that because we want to stay compatible, and that involves parsing things like `foo/bar` directly as a path literal anyway.\n\n## Checklist\n\n<!-- make sure this issue is not redundant or obsolete -->\n\n- [ ] checked [latest Nix manual] \\([source])\n- [ ] checked [open feature issues and pull requests] for possible duplicates\n\n[latest Nix manual]: https://nixos.org/manual/nix/unstable/\n[source]: https://github.com/NixOS/nix/tree/master/doc/manual/source\n[open feature issues and pull requests]: https://github.com/NixOS/nix/labels/feature\n\n---\n\nAdd :+1: to [issues you find important](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc).\n",

Meson imposes similar rules, but they don't translate to the same rules at the Nix level, and we are forced to either use `..` or put all our expression in the repo root. Another alternative is to pass the repo root as an argument, but I don't believe that's any more clear than `..`.\nDisallowing `..` can perhaps be a good constraint on file layout and expression architecture, but then it should be a local setting (e.g. in a flake `nixConfig` or something similar). It's not necessarily confusing or wrong, but depends on circumstances and taste.", "There are many steps in between using bare paths and full-on module system, but the more modular you get the less anything but subdirectories makes sense for decomposition.

Those sets _should_ be similar, especially if your CI setup produces good coverage, but they may not be the same.", "> I suppose the module system mention is very figurative and not representative of real world use.\n\nSlight digresson (feel free to collapse this as OT) but to my knowledge there's essentially a spectrum of structuredness in Nix code that goes from bare language to exclusively modules. I don't think there are any more dimensions to that in practice. Intermediate steps are composing lots of functions, or things like [infuse](https://codeberg.org/amjoseph/infuse.nix/src/branch/trunk/default.nix). And large projects tend to benefit from fewer moving parts, opportunities for logic errors, and obviousness of hacky escape hatches, so this is why I observe a tendency for the module system to naturally encroach on growing systems. Nixpkgs has stopped that development somewhere on the lower end of the abstraction ladder for compatibility and performance reasons, I'd say, but it's arguably a strain on maintainability.", "There's some truth to that, yeah. The module system is not an obvious solution to directory layout rules _in general_, but with some assumptions, a big jump and some waving of hands, that does convey a sensible picture about the broad direction things can go, thanks.\nIf more projects using more modules can enable such a check, that's probably a good thing, but, certainly for now, we have to design for a fairly broad set of acceptable inputs, so I'll mark these two message OT as you're suggesting. \uD83D\uDC4D " ],

Verify that https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/pull/53521 has been merged already or test the issue against that PR.\n2. Install and activate the [Code Snippets](https://wordpress.org/plugins/code-snippets/) plugin.\n3. Add the following code snippet:\n```php\nadd_action(\n    'woocommerce_init',\n    function () {\n        woocommerce_register_additional_checkout_field( array(\n            'id'          => 'mynamespace/number',\n            'type'        => 'select',\n            'label'       => 'Choose number',\n            'location'    => 'address',\n            'required'    => false,\n            'options'     => array(\n                array(\n                    'value' => 1,\n                    'label' => 'One',\n                ),\n                array(\n                    'value' => 7,\n                    'label' => 'Seven',\n                ),\n            ),\n            'placeholder' => 'Hello, choose a number!',\n        ) );\n    }\n);\n\n```\n\n4. Go to `my-account/edit-address/billing/` using Firefox and Safari.\n5. See that the styles of the `Choose number` field are different than the styles of the `Country / Region` field.\n## Screenshots\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">Firefox:\n<br><br>\n<img width=\"868\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8846057-3d65-4175-8631-0f3811ce9b43\" />\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">Safari:\n<br><br>\n<img width=\"861\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45488229-4fb8-4829-9f9e-b0007e8636c7\" />\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n## Expected behavior\n\nI expect the styles of added select fields to look like the styles of existing select fields.\n\n### Browser Environment\n\n- Platform: macOS\n- Browser(s): Firefox and Safari\n\n### WordPress Environment\n\n<details><summary>System Status Report</summary>\n\n```\n### WordPress Environment ###\n\nWordPress address (URL): [Redacted]\nSite address (URL): [Redacted]\nWC Version: 9.6.0-dev\nLegacy REST API Package Version: The Legacy REST API plugin is not installed on this site.\nAction Scheduler Version: ✔ 3.9.0\nLog Directory Writable: ✔\nWP Version: 6.7.1\nWP Multisite: –\nWP Memory Limit: 512 MB\nWP Debug Mode: –\nWP Cron: ✔\nLanguage: en_US\nExternal object cache: –\n\n### Server Environment ###\n\nServer Info: nginx/1.25.4\nPHP Version: 8.2.19\nPHP Post Max Size: 512 MB\nPHP Time Limit: 30\nPHP Max Input Vars: 1000\ncURL Version: 8.8.0\n(SecureTransport) OpenSSL/3.3.0\n\nSUHOSIN Installed: –\nMySQL Version: 8.3.0\nMax Upload Size: 512 MB\nDefault Timezone is UTC: ✔\nfsockopen/cURL: ✔\nSoapClient: ✔\nDOMDocument: ✔\nGZip: ✔\nMultibyte String: ✔\nRemote Post: ✔\nRemote Get: ✔\n\n### Database ###\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n### Post Type Counts ###\n\nattachment: 25\ncustomize_changeset: 2\npage: 10\npost: 16\nproduct: 21\nproduct_variation: 2\nrevision: 56\nshop_coupon: 3\nshop_order: 6\nshop_order_placehold: 3\nshop_subscription: 2\nwp_font_face: 36\nwp_font_family: 12\nwp_global_styles: 2\nwp_navigation: 1\nwp_template: 1\n\n### Security ###\n\nSecure connection (HTTPS): ✔\nHide errors from visitors: ✔\n\n### Active Plugins (8) ###\n\nCode Snippets: by Code Snippets Pro – 3.6.6.1\nSMNTCS Nord Admin Theme: by Niels Lange – 1.4\nSMNTCS Show Active Plugins: by Niels Lange – 1.0\nSMNTCS Show Symlinked Plugins: by Niels Lange – 1.3\nSMNTCS Theme List View: by Niels Lange – 1.3\nWooCommerce Stripe Gateway: by Stripe – 9.0.0\nWooCommerce Subscriptions: by WooCommerce – 7.0.0\nWooCommerce: by Automattic – 9.6.0-dev\n\n### Inactive Plugins (0) ###\n\n\n### Settings ###\n\nLegacy API Enabled: –\nForce SSL: –\nCurrency: EUR (€)\nCurrency Position: left\nThousand Separator: .\nDecimal Separator: ,\nNumber of Decimals: 2\nTaxonomies: Product Types: external (external)\ngrouped (grouped)\nsimple (simple)\nsubscription (subscription)\nvariable (variable)\nvariable subscription (variable-subscription)\n\nTaxonomies: Product Visibility: exclude-from-catalog (exclude-from-catalog)\nexclude-from-search (exclude-from-search)\nfeatured (featured)\noutofstock (outofstock)\nrated-1 (rated-1)\nrated-2 (rated-2)\nrated-3 (rated-3)\nrated-4 (rated-4)\nrated-5 (rated-5)\n\nConnected to WooCommerce.com: –\nEnforce Approved Product Download Directories: ✔\nHPOS feature enabled: ✔\nOrder datastore: Automattic\\WooCommerce\\Internal\\DataStores\\Orders\\OrdersTableDataStore\nHPOS data sync enabled: –\n\n### Logging ###\n\nEnabled: ✔\nHandler: Automattic\\WooCommerce\\Internal\\Admin\\Logging\\LogHandlerFileV2\nRetention period: 30 days\nLevel threshold: –\nLog directory size: 151 KB\n\n### WC Pages ###\n\nShop base: #54 - /products-beta/classic-shop/\nCart: #56 - /cart/ -  Contains the woocommerce/cart block\nCheckout: #57 - /checkout/ -  Contains the woocommerce/checkout block\nMy account: #60 - /my-account/\nTerms and conditions: #61 - /terms/\n\n### Theme ###\n\nName: Storefront\nVersion: 4.6.0\nAuthor URL: https://woocommerce.com/\nChild Theme: ❌ – If you are modifying WooCommerce on a parent theme that you did not build personally we recommend using a child theme.

Historically, this documentation has been scattered over multiple wikis, various other docs sets, obscure places, or not written down at all. The goal of this effort is to fix this to enable contributors to access all of this content in one place, logically structured.\n\n## Task\n\nThe docs include a glossary of terms. Add the \"Code of Conduct\" term and its definition (the term is already included in the glossary, but it lacks a definition).\n\n## Resources\n\n- GitHub: https://github.com/ubuntu/ubuntu-project-docs\n- Docs: https://canonical-ubuntu-project.readthedocs-hosted.com/\n- Glossary\n   - file: https://github.com/ubuntu/ubuntu-project-docs/blob/main/docs/reference/glossary.md\n   - published: https://canonical-ubuntu-project.readthedocs-hosted.com/reference/glossary/\n- MyST (Markdown) glossary help: https://mystmd.org/guide/glossaries-and-terms",

Do so by adding the following lines to your Cargo.toml:\n\n\n[patch.crates-io]\negui = { git = \"https://github.com/emilk/egui\", branch = \"main\" }\n# if you're using eframe:\neframe = { git = \"https://github.com/emilk/egui\", branch = \"main\" }\n-->\n\n**Describe the bug**\nWhen trying to display an image I was having issues getting the images loaded and it turns out that adding the `install_image_loaders` call after restoring the state fails to load the images.\n\n```rust\npub fn new(cc: &eframe::CreationContext<'_>) -> Self {\n    // This is also where you can customize the look and feel of egui using\n    // `cc.egui_ctx.set_visuals` and `cc.egui_ctx.set_fonts`.\n\n    // Load previous app state (if any).\n    // Note that you must enable the `persistence` feature for this to work.\n    if let Some(storage) = cc.storage {\n        return eframe::get_value(storage, eframe::APP_KEY).unwrap_or_default();\n    }\n\n    // Adding this after the restoring the state does not work\n    egui_extras::install_image_loaders(&cc.egui_ctx);\n\n    Default::default()\n}\n```\n\nHowever moving `install_image_loaders` some lines up fixes the issue.\n\n```rust\npub fn new(cc: &eframe::CreationContext<'_>) -> Self {\n    // This is also where you can customize the look and feel of egui using\n    // `cc.egui_ctx.set_visuals` and `cc.egui_ctx.set_fonts`.\n\n    // Moving it here works\n    egui_extras::install_image_loaders(&cc.egui_ctx);\n    \n    // Load previous app state (if any).\n    // Note that you must enable the `persistence` feature for this to work.\n    if let Some(storage) = cc.storage {\n        return eframe::get_value(storage, eframe::APP_KEY).unwrap_or_default();\n    }\n\n    Default::default()\n}\n```\n\nThis might be expected behavior but it was surprising for me because I didn't see it mentioned in the docs. And this is the first time I use egui starting from the eframe_template which comes with the state restoration already configured.\n",

This feature will help users retrieve values even when there are minor typos or differences in the key strings, making the method more robust and user-friendly. Consider using a library like `fuzzywuzzy` or Python's `difflib` for the implementation. Include tests and documentation for the new fuzzy matching capability.\n\nExample. `result.get(\"Voltage (V)\")` should return a \"did you mean `\"Voltage [V]\"`.\n",

Without that it's harder to understand where these insights are coming from, or for them to be marked as “default” so it's clear that there's not a bug. \n\n## Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nLooking into the insights definitions to correlate them with a flag and see who created it, it's very inefficient, also you'd have to know this is the case or you may think it's a bug.\n\n## Additional context\nFrom: https://posthoghelp.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/31129\n\n### Debug info\n\n```shell\nKind: bug\n\nTarget area: analytics\n\nReport event: http://go/ticketByUUID/d819d44d-6738-4705-9861-c89d2685b9e4\n\nSession: https://us.posthog.com/project/sTMFPsFhdP1Ssg/replay/0196ef49-553d-7b99-8e92-a2d0a93921f7?t=2269\n\nExceptions: https://us.posthog.com/project/2/error_tracking?filterGroup=%7B%22type%22%3A%22AND%22%2C%22values%22%3A%5B%7B%22type%22%3A%22AND%22%2C%22values%22%3A%5B%7B%22key%22%3A%22%24session_id%22%2C%22value%22%3A%5B%220196ef49-553d-7b99-8e92-a2d0a93921f7%22%5D%2C%22operator%22%3A%22exact%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22event%22%7D%5D%7D%5D%7D\n\nLocation: https://us.posthog.com/project/49108/cohorts\n\nPersons-on-events mode for project: person_id_override_properties_joined\n```",

Thank you for your contribution!  It seems that your PR https://github.com/alibaba/fluss/pull/880 has not correctly understood the purpose of this issue. Currently, there are many classes in Fluss that do not reach the 70% test coverage threshold. However, Fluss has a Jacoco coverage check set at 70% during the build process. To bypass this check, we added an ignore entry in the pom.xml file: https://github.com/alibaba/fluss/blob/main/fluss-test-coverage/pom.xml#L247.\n\nOur goal is to improve the test coverage of those ignored classes to eventually remove them from the ignore list, and the purpose of increasing test coverage is to improve code stability. Therefore, when adding tests, it is important to understand the logic of the classes and code, and to add effective tests (UT or ITCase) that align with the code logic, rather than simply adding mock-based tests solely aimed at increasing coverage.\n\nA reference example can be found here: https://github.com/alibaba/fluss/pull/856.\n\nAdditionally, I will create several sub-tasks/issues.

      "description" : "### Search before asking\n\n- [x] I searched in the [issues](https://github.com/alibaba/fluss/issues) and found nothing similar.\n\n\n### Motivation\n\nThis issue aims to enhance our Flink connector by introducing support for the `$changelog` auxiliary table. This feature is essential for capturing and processing change data capture (CDC) events seamlessly within Flink streaming jobs.\n\nFluss primary key tables support change data capature to track row-level changes for updates and deletes. When streaming read the primary key table, the flink connector emit records with Flink native `RowKind` (`INSERT`, `UPDATE_BEFORE`, `UPDATE_AFTER`, `DELETE`) to enable stateful computation on changelogs. On the other hand, there are many use cases that users want to consume the plain logs without converting into Flink native `RowKind`. This feature is similar to [Paimon `$audit_log` table](https://paimon.apache.org/docs/0.8/maintenance/system-tables/#audit-log-table), and [Databricks `table_changes(..)` query](https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta/delta-change-data-feed.html#what-is-the-schema-for-the-change-data-feed). \n\n\n\n### Solution\n\n### Implementation\n\n1. `FlinkCatalog` supports `getTable` for `<table_name>$changelog` table path, and the returned table should include additional metadata columns (see following). \n2. `FlinkRecordEmitter` of `FlinkSourceReader` should have a special `FlussRowToFlinkRowConverter` that converts the Fluss `InternalRow` into Flink `RowData` with the additional metadata columns. \n3. `CoordinatorService#createTable` should add validation that whether the created table using system reserved columns (`_change_type`, `_log_offset`, `_commit_timestamp`). \n\n### Schema of the `$changelog` table\n\n| Column Name | Type | Values |\n|--------|--------|--------|\n| `_change_type` | String | `+I`, `-U`, `+U`, `-D` |\n| `_log_offset` | long | the offset of the log |\n| `_commit_timestamp` | TIMESTAMP_LTZ | the timestamp associated when the change was happended | \n\nReference: https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta/delta-change-data-feed.html#what-is-the-schema-for-the-change-data-feed\n\n### Anything else?\n\nYou can take Paimon `$audit_log` implementation as an example: https://github.com/apache/paimon/blob/release-1.0/paimon-core/src/main/java/org/apache/paimon/table/system/SystemTableLoader.java#L69\n\n### Willingness to contribute\n\n- [ ] I'm willing to submit a PR!",

You're absolutely right about the XPU support limitations. The main areas that need updates for full XPU support are:\n\n1. The [`autocast` function](https://docs.ultralytics.com/reference/utils/torch_utils/#ultralytics.utils.torch_utils.autocast) in `torch_utils.py` currently only handles CUDA and CPU devices\n2. The [`check_amp` function](https://docs.ultralytics.com/reference/utils/checks/#ultralytics.utils.checks.check_amp) returns `False` for non-CUDA devices\n3. The [`select_device` function](https://docs.ultralytics.com/reference/utils/torch_utils/#ultralytics.utils.torch_utils.select_device) needs XPU device handling for auto-batch functionality\n\nYour PR would be very welcome!

Your comprehensive XPU implementation looks very solid and the performance improvements you're seeing are impressive. The simplified autocast approach in your latest comment is much cleaner and should handle both CUDA and XPU properly.\n\nSince you've got a working implementation with all the key components (device detection, AMP support, memory handling), I'd suggest either you or @huahuadeliaoliao submit a PR with these changes. The attached files provide a great foundation - just make sure to test the device detection logic handles edge cases like `device=\"xpu:0\"` vs `device=\"xpu\"` consistently across all the modified functions.\n\nWe'd be happy to review and merge XPU support once it's submitted as a PR. Thanks for taking the initiative to get this working!", "@glenn-jocher I am sitting behind a corporate proxy that makes any outside update difficult.  If someone makes the requested changes, I can always test it out with the hardware available to me. Will have to explore internally to see if update is possible.\n\nIn the trainer.py is this a good option? If not, I am seeing a warning, but no other issues. I don't know if xpu supports GradScaler, but the code doesn't produce warning or error. The below logic can avoid a warning for XPU case, but might work in future if it is supported.\n\nLine 290\n\n        if torch.cuda.is_available():\n            self.scaler = (\n                torch.amp.GradScaler(\"cuda\", enabled=self.amp) if TORCH_2_4 else torch.cuda.amp.GradScaler(enabled=self.amp)\n            )\n        elif torch.xpu.is_available():\n            self.scaler = (torch.amp.GradScaler(self.device, enabled=self.amp))\n\nThe select_device method in torch_utils.py needs modification. The variable device is used interchangeably making it difficult. If we give device=0, what does it mean. It could be a GPU or XPU. At present I am passing device=\"xpu\" which limits its usage to one card. There are machines with more than one card.\n\nThere could be a machine with CPU, iGPU, NPU, dGPU (NVIDIA), dGPU (Intel called XPU), dGPU (AMD), and ASIC (Intel HPU) all in one machine. Checking logic like torch.cuda.is_available() or torch.xpu.is_available() or torch.cpu.is_available() will all return true because they are present in the system. This could lead to issues like user specifying device=0 which defaults to CUDA even though user might have selected XPU based on how the workload is running. If the user has done YOLO('yolov8l.pt').to(DEVICE), the DEVICE should be honored across the workflow logic. With what changes are proposed above, setting device=\"xpu\" or device=\"xpu:0\" should work. Selecting device=\"0\" on a XPU machine fails because it defaults to CUDA when it is not available. Multicard training needs further study because theoretically it should be same for CUDA or XPU.", "Thanks for the detailed analysis @azhuvath! I completely understand the corporate proxy constraints - that's a common challenge.\n\nYour GradScaler approach looks good, though I'd suggest checking `self.device.type == \"xpu\"` instead of `torch.xpu.is_available()` to ensure you're actually using an XPU device rather than just having XPU capability available.\n\nYou raise excellent points about the device selection complexity in multi-accelerator systems. The current logic in `select_device` does assume CUDA priority, which isn't ideal for XPU workflows. Your approach of explicitly passing `device=\"xpu\"` is the right pattern for now - it's clear and unambiguous.\n\nSince you're unable to submit PRs directly, perhaps @huahuadeliaoliao could incorporate your working changes into their planned PR? Your attached files provide a solid foundation and the performance results (15x over CPU, 2.5x with AMP) are compelling evidence this implementation works well.\n\nFor multi-XPU support, the pattern should indeed be similar to multi-GPU - handling device strings like `\"xpu:0,1\"` in the device parsing logic, though that can be a follow-up enhancement once basic XPU support is merged.", "@glenn-jocher I tested the changes on Intel Meteor Lake (MTL) iGPU (Integrated Graphics). It is working fine. So it should also work on Intel Lunar Lake (LNL) iGPU. Since I have already tested on Max 1100, I am more or less confident that it should work on Intel Xe graphics which came out in the last 3 years for edge, client, and data center.

      "repositoryName" : "ONEARMY/community-platform",
      "description" : "> Do you have attention to detail and would like to work on making the UI nicer? This issue is then for you! :))\n\n## Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.\n1. Comment section is still not matching the designs. The whitespace is lacking between the nested comments and the visually it looks tight, packed and overwhelming.\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6340e9d-7671-4308-acd0-10bf42bffd4b)\n\n2. Additionally the comment on mobile has spacing from the left, leaving the space not being utilised and making the text unnecessarily squeezed.\n<img width=\"361\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28e206b7-fbe6-471c-a2c4-8f09b1284eeb\" />\n\nEspecially with nested comments it becomes obvious:\n<img width=\"361\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86610c32-e365-414c-868e-02621ca54564\" />\n\n3. If the comment has some enters for new line and the the Show more button shows, it creates an awkward space. There is also gap applied.\n<img width=\"918\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a76486ea-e490-4860-940e-c49498ebeb1e\" />\n\n## Describe the solution you'd like\n\nGenerally I think this will need not only adjusting the numbers, but some minor restructuring of the divs. So, let me try to number the improvements:\n\n---\n\n1. Improving the spacings between the nested comments. In the designs there are also the useful buttons in each comment, that are not yet implemented. In the design however, the spacing occurs naturally because of the useful buttons, so I did not need to add a big margin-bottom. I will leave the solution here up to you, but account for the fact that one day in the future we will introduce the useful button for the comment.\n<img width=\"670\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00f1a492-0cfe-4a26-a6d4-a25e9f1e81d2\" />\n\nDon't be afraid to be generous with the spacings, in the devtools i tried 50px as in my designs\n<img width=\"978\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f23db889-05ba-4607-bedc-25d4a4abc321\" />\n\n---\n\n2. Mobile improvement. Here I upload a gif of the solution that I utilised in the Figma designs - it was to hide the left column with the avatar, allowing the text to stretch and then showing the avatar next to the username in 30x30px size.\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/329f7267-8bdb-4d18-a47c-73b7e44d5478)\n\nDon't forget to make sure that the author's badge is working \n<img width=\"502\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b3012c1-567c-4e5e-b781-5f81852bbe28\" />\n\n\n---\n\n3. Putting the Show More button directly under the comment, trimming the whitespaces. \n<img width=\"947\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c07017f7-60f7-4c1c-92f4-859c1267736f\" />\n\n\n---\n\n4. Decreasing the gap here to 5px from 10px\n<img width=\"404\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a1c56f9-11f3-4bd0-9e52-239948b15c2f\" />\n\n\n\n---\n\n5. As you can see, on mobile it gets quite tight. I would suggest removing the word Published from the \"Published x time ago\" information for the comments.\n<img width=\"322\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe06174a-b402-452b-a18b-eefd38b03192\" />\n\n\n---\n\n6. OPTIONAL - In case you would want to act on the point 5. above even more, I would suggest for mobile screens shortening the formulation even more, saying for example 1h ago, 3mo ago or 2yr ago. Reddit does it this way as well.\n\n<img width=\"182\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c194f4c-a4ee-42a1-9c59-dcd5c6b77e42\" />\n\n---\n\n7. OPTIONAL - In case you would still be up for a challenge, having these 2 aligned on the baseline would be a nice achievement, however I didn't manage to get the desired result, since as you can see below, the align-items:baseline does not align them.\n<img width=\"742\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27968c77-de84-400a-8d3f-22e88b37b627\" />\n\n\n\n##  Additional context - [FIGMA FILE HERE](https://www.figma.com/design/XYV3fr8UVOdkNyBmKHHR7f/CP---Comments-Useful---Mobile?node-id=48-79)\nYou can find the figma file above. You can see the components, the desktop and the mobile versions. These design include the correct answer feature or the useful buttons, which are not yet implemented, so feel free to ignore those.\n\n<img width=\"761\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/119c7345-44cf-4baa-9ef6-feed6a05d7ad\" />\n\nIf you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask. :))",

Cool to see that you are up for tackling these design improvements. \n\nJust yesterday we were talking with Ben, that this issue was in his opinion hard to follow and that the screenshots I included could be a bit confusing (some of them with the useful button, some without), so I thought about rewriting it. Is the issue clear to you though? If so, than let's keep it and if you find anything even slightly unclear you can tag me in the comments at any time and I'll be happy to give more clarification. :))\n\nAlso Ben mentioned that he does not have the capacity to prioritise this at the moment, so this would actually be really really helpful and valuable contribution from you. <3\n\nBen was also wrote yesterday that some of the points I mentioned were implemented already. After checking, it was only the point 5. - removing the word \"Published\" from the timestamp.\n\nI will ask the team about implementing the useful counter and let you know. :))", "@dalibormrska  - I think I understand it, but here let me try to summarize and let me know if I am understanding your requests correctly.\n\n\nRequest 1: Increase spacing between the nested comments.\nSolutions:\n- Long Term Solution: Add the Useful Counter to comments which will naturally add whitespace between the comments\n- Easier Solution: Manually add whitespace between the nested comments (which is the space the Useful Counter will take up later)\n\nRequest 2: When viewing comments (especially reply comments) in mobile, the comment text is extremely narrow.\nSolution: Remove the left side margin (make the comment text and profile image be on the same vertical line). Use the smaller version of the profile picture. Basically try to get to this design:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4045704-088e-4a7c-a7ff-bf3d1c5535b3)\n\nRequest 3: If a comment has alot of line breaks, there could be an awkward gap between the comment text and the 'Show more' button\nSolution: Remove line breaks from the end of the comment when hiding the rest of the comment behind the 'Show more' button\n\nRequest 4: Decrease Gap between profile/upload date line and comment body from 10px to 5px\nSolution: This is straight forward :), just decrease gap from 10px to 5px\n\nRequest 5: Remove the 'Published ... time ago' part of the upload date to save space\nSolution: Already Done :)\n\nRequest 6 (OPTIONAL): The upload date still takes alot of space on mobile\nSolution: Use time short hand in mobile. For example, use '5h ago' instead of '5 hours ago' or '4mo ago' instead of '4 months ago'\n\nRequest 7 (OPTIONAL): The user flag, user name, and upload date are not aligned\nSolution: Align the 3 on the baseline" ],

However, when I try to load the grid later, the modified cell does **not appear in the reading line**, and it is **not read aloud or included in play mode**.\n\n\n**Expected behavior:**\nThe cell should behave like any other — appear in the reading line and be included in the spoken output.\n\n**Actual behavior:**\nThe cell is excluded from the reading line and \"Play\" mode does not process it. It seems as if the cell is silently ignored.\n\n**Additional info:**\n- The grid loads without visible errors.\n- Removing the `http action` restores normal behavior.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31e8b343-aa83-49e4-b720-89b2a1bcd5f5)\n\nIs this an intentional limitation or a bug? Is there a recommended way to include HTTP actions without breaking reading/play functionality?\n\nThank you for your great work!",

      "title" : "[RF] Plotting extended pdf together with data unexpectedly scales pdf to number of events in data",
      "url" : "https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/18929",
      "repositoryName" : "root-project/root",
      "description" : "When plotting an extended pdf (i.e. a pdf that also makes a prediction for the number of events) together with a RooFit dataset, users expect that the plotted pdf is normalized to the number of predicted events, in order to see what the actual prediction is and meaningfully compare to the data.\n\nHowever, the pdf is automatically scaled to the *observed* number of events in the dataset, so there is no way to get visual feedback on whether the predicted number of events makes sense. This is useful for models that don't make any prediction on the total number of events, but misleading otherwise. See also the following forum post where this came up:\nhttps://root-forum.cern.ch/t/roofit-background-component-not-staying-constant-despite-rooconstvar-setconstant-true/63650/2\n\nUsually, this problem stays under the radar because post-fit event number predictions usually match the observed number of events. But in the case where the shape is correlated with the normalization, this is not the case, and the resulting small difference between post-fit and observed number of events can make you hesitant and open a forum post at best, or in the worst case the scaling to the observed number of events makes you believe the fit was good while it was actually not.\n\nOne can work around this by introducing additional scale factors (see the `Normalization` command argument for [RooAbsReal::plotOn()](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classRooAbsReal.html#ae26e30ce9fcf11b820a7a8e26f4aa424)), but this should not be necessary. It would be better if extended pdfs are by default normalized to the predicted number of events when plotting, not to the observed number of events.\n\nThis is a good first issue to help with RooFit development, since the required changes should be little. The challenge is mostly to figure out where the scaling to the number of events in the datasets happens, and then add a code path for the case where the RooAbsPdf makes a prediction on the expected events (i.e. the return value of [RooAbsPdf::expectedEvents()](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classRooAbsPdf.html#a2debaf3731b6d5f6027ee1ede917af01) is non-zero.\n\nReproducer:\n```c++\nRooRealVar x{\"x\", \"x\", 0, 1};\nRooRealVar n{\"n\", \"n\", 5000, 0, 20000};\n\nx.setBins(1);\n\nRooUniform pdf{\"pdf\", \"pdf\", x};\nstd::unique_ptr<RooAbsData> data{pdf.generateBinned(x, 10000)};\n\nRooExtendPdf extPdf{\"ext_pdf\", \"ext_pdf\", pdf, n};\n\nauto c1 = new TCanvas{\"c1\", \"c1\"};\n\nauto frame = x.frame();\ndata->plotOn(frame);\nextPdf.plotOn(frame);\n\n// Should be the value of n\nstd::cout << frame->getCurve()->GetY()[1] << std::endl;\n\nframe->Draw();\n\nc1->SaveAs(\"plot.png\");\n```\nThe output is:\n```\n10000\n```\nBut we expect the curve to represent the actual number of expected events, which is 5000 in this reproducer.\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3cb2ac03-c50c-4c7e-9537-e946c85461c2)",

For example if you want to place a dipole at an angle phi in the xy plane, just place two dipoles, one x-polarized with amplitude `cos(phi)`, and the other one y-polarized with amplitude `sin(phi)`. Similarly this can generalize for a polar angle `theta` in 3D. \n\nWe could still provide a convenience feature for that though, a classmethod of `PointDipole` that creates a list of these sources based on the provided angles. This is a great first issue for someone to pick up." ],

These extras are needed by the MSSQL hook, but we cannot blindly accept these will work in pymssql connections.\n\nExample connection:\n```json\n{\n  \"conn_type\": \"mssql\",\n  \"extra\": {\n    \"driver\": \"ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server\",\n    \"encrypt\": \"yes\",\n    \"sqlalchemy_scheme\": \"mssql+pyodbc\"\n  },\n    \"host\": \"xxx\",\n    \"login\": \"xxx\",\n    \"password\": \"xxx\",\n    \"port\": 1433,\n    \"schema\": \"master\"\n}\n```\n\nErrors when using an SQLQueryExecutor using the above connection:\n\n```python\nFile \"src/pymssql/_pymssql.pyx\", line 586, in pymssql._pymssql.connect\nTypeError: connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'driver'\n\nFile \"src/pymssql/_pymssql.pyx\", line 586, in pymssql._pymssql.connect\nTypeError: connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'encrypt'\n```\n\n### What you think should happen instead\n\nThese conenctions should continue working as they did in `apache-airflow-providers-microsoft-mssql==3.9.2`\n\n### How to reproduce\n\nHave MSSQL connections defined with `extra` parameters\nInstall `apache-airflow-providers-microsoft-mssql` >= 4.0.0\nTry an mssql hook using sqlalchemy\n\n### Anything else\n\n_No response_\n\n### Are you willing to submit PR?\n\n- [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n",

We avoid adding more branching logic to `MsSqlHook`.\n2. Users choose the hook that matches their driver, which is consistent with how other database providers work.\n\nWhat’s your take?

      "repositoryName" : "medplum/medplum",
      "description" : "## Description\n\nWhen using Medplum's AWS Textract integration to extract text from PDF documents, the API response contains a `NextToken` field. This token indicates that the response is paginated and that additional results are available. However, it appears that the current Medplum integration does not utilize the `NextToken` to fetch the next set of results, which causes incomplete text extraction when the document is large.\n\nI noticed that the [loadAwsConfig](https://github.com/medplum/medplum/blob/main/packages/server/src/cloud/aws/config.ts#L13) function references the `NextToken`, so I would like to confirm whether this behavior is due to a misconfiguration on my end. I tested the integration using the AWS Textract action available in the Medplum app (app.medplum.com) as well as with the [textract demo bot](https://github.com/medplum/medplum/blob/main/examples/medplum-demo-bots/src/textract-bot.ts), and encountered the same issue in both cases.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Go to https://app.medplum.com/Media/new\n2. Upload a PDF with many pages\n3. Go to its detail page\n4. Click on the `AWS Textract` action to process the PDF\n5. Once the extraction is complete, open the detail page of the resulting `Media` resource\n6. Check that the `content` only contains text from the first page of the PDF, and also check for the presence of the `NextToken` attribute indicating more pages of text are available\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc6876a1-0b3b-468f-9d7b-e5c8dfa650a5)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/189b43ae-5feb-4775-b62e-9c5d47adbab6)\n",

      "repositoryName" : "stdlib-js/stdlib",
      "description" : "## Description\n\nThis RFC proposes refactoring and adding accessor protocol support to [`@stdlib/stats/base/stdevtk`](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/tree/develop/lib/node_modules/%40stdlib/stats/base/stdevtk).\n\nFor background on the accessor protocol, see https://blog.stdlib.io/introducing-the-accessor-protocol-for-array-like-objects/.\n\nExamples of what we are looking for:\n\n- `stats/base/min`: https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/commit/fbb31fbaafbbbf233740a41a88a57f4db1cb427b ([package](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/tree/develop/lib/node_modules/%40stdlib/stats/base/min))\n- `stats/base/cumax`: https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/commit/11f1341134c5d6c7c0ecd82c99dff766e08e731a ([package](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/tree/develop/lib/node_modules/%40stdlib/stats/base/cumax))\n- `stats/base/cumin`: https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/commit/528efd8000eb7b910f64e63796a8a7c2fdfa03cd ([package](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/tree/develop/lib/node_modules/%40stdlib/stats/base/cumin))\n- `stats/base/mediansorted`: https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/commit/065f86535e3f1915160f91820f1fa0af79633b72 ([package](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/tree/develop/lib/node_modules/%40stdlib/stats/base/mediansorted))\n- `stats/base/mskmax`: https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/commit/417e65361234ec46382f58cc303a544f5bbcbf9e ([package](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/tree/develop/lib/node_modules/%40stdlib/stats/base/mskmax))\n\nWhile the changes proposed in this RFC will **not** match the implementations found in the above packages, the packages should provide a conceptual idea of what is desired. Do **not** simply copy-paste the code found in those packages without reasoning about expected behavior and API design.\n\n### Key Points\n\n#### Refactoring\n\nWhen refactoring and cleaning up existing implementations, pay special attention to the changes made in the commits referred to above. You'll need to go line-by-line in [`@stdlib/stats/base/stdevtk`](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/tree/develop/lib/node_modules/%40stdlib/stats/base/stdevtk) and compare with the changes made in the above commits.\n\nIn particular, we're interested in\n\n1. standardizing language in descriptions so that all packages in `stats/base` use similar language for describing input parameters and behavior.\n2. updating examples to align with current conventions in stdlib.\n3. simplifying examples and benchmarks to use utilities for generating random arrays.\n4. reducing code duplication by having the main package entry point delegate to the `ndarray` API.\n\n#### Accessor protocol\n\nPrior to adding accessor protocol support, check whether the implementation has any strided array dependencies. For example, for certain algorithms for computing the mean, implementations will depend on algorithms for computing the sum. Ensure that the upstream implementations have support for accessor arrays. If not, you'll need to open a separate PR adding support in the upstream dependencies before working on this package.\n\nWhen adding support for the accessor protocol, you'll need to do the following:\n\n##### Create an accessors file\n\nCreate a new `lib/accessors.js` file. This file will contain an implementation which can handle accessor arrays.\n\n##### Modify the ndarray file\n\nModify the `lib/ndarray.js` file to delegate to the accessors implementation when one (or more) of the input arrays is an accessor array.\n\n##### Update tests\n\nModify the tests to include explicit tests for accessor arrays.\n\n#### Run tests and other commands\n\nFor each of the following commands, please run them from the root stdlib repository directory (not the package folder!).\n\nTo run unit tests,\n\n```bash\nmake test TESTS_FILTER=\".*/stats/base/stdevtk/.*\"\n```\n\nTo run examples,\n\n```bash\nmake examples EXAMPLES_FILTER=\".*/stats/base/stdevtk/.*\"\n```\n\nTo run benchmarks,\n\n```bash\nmake benchmark BENCHMARKS_FILTER=\".*/stats/base/stdevtk/.*\"\n```\n\n### Create pull request\n\nProvided all tests, examples, and benchmarks successfully execute and pass and that you've updated the package's documentation, you are now ready to open a pull request!\n\n* * *\n\n## Notes\n\n- If you are interested in contributing a PR which addresses this RFC and still getting familiar with our project conventions, please do **not** submit LLM-generated code. Please consult our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md) and the associated [development guide](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/docs/development.md). Failure to respect project conventions will result in your PR being rejected without review. Thank you for understanding!\n\n### Checklist\n\n- [X] I have read and understood the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n- [X] Searched for existing issues and pull requests.\n- [X] The issue name begins with `[RFC]:`.\n",

      "comments" : [ "# :wave: Important: PLEASE READ :wave:\n\nThis issue has been labeled as a **good first issue** and is available for anyone to work on.\n\nIf this is your first time contributing to an open source project, some aspects of the development process may seem unusual, arcane, or some combination of both.\n\n1.  **You cannot \"claim\" issues.** People new to open source often want to \"claim\" or be assigned an issue before beginning work. The typical rationale is that people want to avoid wasted work in the event that someone else ends up working the issue. However, this practice is not effective in open source, as it often leads to \"issue squatting\", in which an individual asks to be assigned, is granted their request, and then never ends up working on the issue. Accordingly, you are encouraged to communicate your intent to address this issue, ideally by providing a rough outline as to how you plan to address the issue or asking clarifying questions, but, at the end of the day, we will take running code and rough consensus in order to move forward quickly.\n2.  **We have a very high bar for contributions.** We have very high standards for contributions and expect all contributions—whether new features, tests, or documentation—to be rigorous, thorough, and complete. Once a pull request is merged into stdlib, that contribution immediately becomes the collective responsibility of all maintainers of stdlib. When we merge code into stdlib, we are saying that we, the maintainers, commit to reviewing subsequent changes and making bugfixes to the code. Hence, in order to ensure future maintainability, this naturally leads to a higher standard of contribution.\n\nBefore working on this issue and opening a pull request, please read the project's [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md). These guidelines and the associated [development guide](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/docs/contributing/development.md) provide important information, including links to stdlib's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), license policy, and steps for setting up your local development environment.\n\nTo reiterate, we **strongly** encourage you to refer to our contributing guides **before** beginning work on this issue. Failure to follow our guidelines significantly decreases the likelihood that you'll successfully contribute to stdlib and may result in automatic closure of a pull request without review.\n\nSetting up your local development environment is a critical first step, as doing so ensures that automated development processes for linting, license verification, and unit testing can run prior to authoring commits and pushing changes. If you would prefer to avoid manual setup, we provide pre-configured [development containers](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/tree/develop/.devcontainer) for use locally or in GitHub Codespaces.\n\nWe place a high value on consistency throughout the stdlib codebase. We encourage you to closely examine other packages in stdlib and attempt to emulate the practices and conventions found therein.\n\n-   If you are attempting to contribute a new package, sometimes the best approach is to simply copy the contents of an existing package and then modify the minimum amount necessary to implement the feature (e.g., changing descriptions, parameter names, and implementation).\n-   If you are contributing tests, find a package implementing a similar feature and emulate the tests of that package.\n-   If you are updating documentation, examine several similar packages and emulate the content, style, and prose of those packages.\n\nIn short, the more effort you put in to ensure that your contribution looks and feels like stdlib—including variables names, bracket spacing, line breaks, etc—the more likely that your contribution will be reviewed and ultimately accepted. We encourage you to closely study the codebase **before** beginning work on this issue.\n\n:sparkles: Thank you again for your interest in stdlib, and we look forward to reviewing your future contributions. :sparkles:\n", "\nHi @kgryte \uD83D\uDC4B,\n\nI've been exploring the implementation of `@stdlib/stats/base/stdevtk` as part of this RFC, and I wanted to share my findings and seek your input before proceeding further.\n\n---\nThe current implementation of `stdevtk` is essentially a thin wrapper around:\n\n- [`@stdlib/stats/base/variancetk`](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stats/tree/develop/base/variancetk) — used to compute the variance.\n- [`@stdlib/math/base/special/sqrt`](https://github.com/stdlib-js/math/tree/develop/base/special/sqrt) — used to compute the square root of the result.\n\n```js\nfunction stdevtk( N, correction, x, stride ) {\n    return sqrt( variancetk( N, correction, x, stride ) );\n}\n```\n- The `variancetk` package already has full **accessor protocol support**.\n- The `sqrt` function is a **scalar function** applied to a single number (i.e., the result of `variancetk`), not to array elements.\n- Since `stdevtk` does not access or manipulate elements of a strided array, adding an accessor protocol has no significance here — the functionality of the code will remain `completely unchanged`.\n- Even if we added accessor support here, the array would be double-checked unnecessarily, as `variancetk` already handles it internally.\n\n---\nShould I proceed with refactoring the code and raise a PR?\nPlease let me know what you'd prefer.\n\nNote: I am new to open source, and I used LLMs to improve the above comment writing and also to better understand some of the underlying concepts of the package. However, all the above observations and conclusions are entirely my own. I hope I am adhering to the contribution guidelines.\n" ],

      "description" : "### Is there an existing issue already for this feature request/idea?\n\n- [x] I have searched for an existing issue, and could not find anything. I believe this is a new feature request to be evaluated.\n\n### What problem is this feature going to solve? Why should it be added?\n\nImporting a db with pg_dump using a single worker is slow. There is also no easy hook for the `SELECT timescaledb_pre_restore();` and `SELECT timescaledb_post_restore();` functions.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nA common pattern is to split the job into pgdumps predata, data, and postdata stages. You generally want to use a single worker when copying the schema, many workers when copying the actual data, and at least one worker when applying constraints at the end depending on how fast that is. The current extra settings flag does not give you the control to do this.\n\nI'm willing to work on this feature. Looking at the existing codebase, this does look like a good first issue assuming prior experience with pg_dump, since the import section is fairly self-contained.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nRunning a shell script by piping to kubectl exec sh). This is pretty close to what we do now, since pg_dump/pg_restore is fairly independent of how it runs.\n\nOther options would be to have a CNPG-I plugin for other restore options like pgcopydb. Another is to not bother with any optimizations but to add six lines to  detect whether timescaledb is a preloaded extension and if so to run the  `SELECT timescaledb_pre_restore();` and `SELECT timescaledb_post_restore();` functions which are required to load the backup correctly, with no API changes and only a fix to import databases with a common extension.\n\n### Additional context\n\nExposing a good API for this is tricky and this is something I'd like a maintainer opinion on. \n\n### Backport?\n\nNo\n\n### Are you willing to actively contribute to this feature?\n\nYes\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct",

      "description" : "Aside from #2597, the only advantage the `transaction_entry` command has over the `tx` command is that you can use it to query for a particular transaction in a single ledger version. Adding the standard ledger-lookup options (`ledger_index` & `ledger_hash`) to the `tx` method would make `tx`'s proper functionality a strict superset of `transaction_entry`. After doing so, we could simplify the API by removing the `transaction_entry` method.\r\n\r\nIf the request specifies a ledger with `ledger_index` / `ledger_hash` (or maybe even the deprecated `ledger` field), the `tx` command should query _only_ the specified ledger. If the requested transaction hash is not included in the specified ledger, the method should return a `txnNotFound` error.",

      "description" : "### Overview\n\nWhat is the problem we're solving? For very simple items, this can be encapsulated in the success criteria.\n\nPuerto Rico data is incorporated into EIA spreadsheets in separate tabs that mirror the ones that we already process in PUDL. In #4312, we brought the Puerto Rico data for EIA 923 into raw assets. EIA 860M also has Puerto Rico data in separate tabs, starting in `eia860m-2018-03.xlsx`. This is an important first step to bringing in Puerto Rico data for EIA 860M into PUDL.\n\n### Success Criteria\n\nHow will we know that we're done?\n\n* [ ] raw_eia860m__puerto_rico_generator_existing is extracted into a dataframe\n* [ ] raw_eia860m__puerto_rico_generator_proposed is extracted into a dataframe\n* [ ] raw_eia860m__puerto_rico_generator_retired is extracted into a dataframe\n\n### Get set up\n\n- [ ] Fork the PUDL repository and follow the steps to set up the [PUDL development environment](https://catalystcoop-pudl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/dev_setup.html)\n- [ ] Activate the pudl-dev environment: mamba activate pudl-dev\n- [ ] Grab the latest raw data for any relevant tables - in this case, EIA 860. To do so, run pudl_datastore --dataset eia860\n\n### Next steps\n\nFollowing the instructions in our [development documentation](https://catalystcoop-pudl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/existing_data_updates.html#map-the-structure-of-the-new-data) for adding new data, update the:\n* [ ] `eia860m/file_map.csv`\n* [ ] `eia860m/page_map.csv`\n* [ ] `eia860m/skip_rows.csv`\n* [ ] `eia860m/skip_footer.csv`\n* [ ] create a spreadsheet in the `eia860m/column_maps` folder for each new tab: `puerto_rico_generator_existing`, `puerto_rico_generator_proposed` and `puerto_rico_generator_retired`. These _should_ be identical to the corresponding EIA 860M pages that are already mapped, with the exception of the data only starting in 2018-03.\n* [ ] Generate the `raw_eia860m` assets, and debug as needed.\n",

But I also don't want the alert notification to be obnoxious, so that I can retain my focus.\n\nSome ideas for a better UX:\n- Make the recurring events darker (using the same colors as the events in the past). This will help prevent the problem of the user trying to make an edit in the first case.\n- Replace the regular `alert()` with a toast (use `react-toastify`, which we already use in the `SomedayEventForm`)\n\n### Use Case\n\nThis'll help users still see all their events while also making it less punitive when they naturally attempt to edit a recurring event.\n\n### Additional Context\n\nWe currently only support viewing recurring events in Compass; we do not support making a change to a recurring event (yet). \n\n\nThe current UX:\n\n<img width=\"1914\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9a8d676-f938-4881-bc71-9bfd4f4321f5\" />",

I believe it is okay to stack toast error messages in certain UX scenarios.\n\nI can sort of relate to the annoyance behind stacking repeated identical toasts for this particular UX experience (recurring events) but I don't think we should go and apply it everywhere without careful consideration.\n\nCan you please refactor the code to:\n\n- Provide a parameter like preventDuplicate to the toast function to optionally prevent duplicate messages\n- Have the prevent duplicate toast messages change apply only to recurring events for now. We can discuss preventing duplicate error messages in other places later.\n```", "On it, Thank youuuuu ", "phewww, just created a pr. might wanna check it out. Everything addressed @that-one-arab ", "Unassigning due to inactivity" ],

This will help you learn the basic handling data fetching in Solid.js.\n\n---\n***Note: You don't have ask permission to start solving the issue or get assigned, since these issues are supposed to be always open for new contributors. The actions-user bot will reset the file back to previous state for the next contributor after your commit is merged. So you can just simply start working with the issue right away!***\n\nIssue created by ***![zshaian](https://github.com/zshaian)***.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nYou can start by navigating to the folder ./task/solid/medium\n\nOnce you are on that folder you can then install the packages that you are going to need to run Solid.js framework, you can do so by running `npm i`\n\nAfter installing the dependencies you can open the src directory and App.jsx file, and start implementing your solution!\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8587e4c-021e-43c2-8bbd-772805ae9605)\n\n**All the CSS classes needed in this project has already been done for you in index.css and app.module.css.**\n\n## Requirements\n- Update the component based on the fetching status: loading, error, success.\n- Display the current quote.\n- Generate a new quote when the \"New Quote\" button is clicked.\n\nIf you can display the quote and its current state while fetching, and be able to generate a new quote, you are ready to make a pull request.\n\n---\nTo work with this issue, you need to have npm and NodeJS installed to your local machine.\nCheck out [README.md](https://github.com/fork-commit-merge/fork-commit-merge/blob/main/README.md) for more instructions of installing npm and NodeJS as well as how to make a pull request.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions here if you have some problems!\n\n**Also, kindly give this project a star to enhance its visibility for new developers!**",

      "description" : "Hi all, I finally finished adding the support of localization, and currently WGDashboard support the following languages:\r\n\r\n- Czech\r\n- Chinese (Simplified)\r\n- Chinese (Traditional)\r\n- Dutch\r\n- English\r\n- German\r\n- Italian\r\n- Polish\r\n- Spanish\r\n- Swedish\r\n- Russian\r\n- Turkish\r\n- Ukrainian\r\n\r\nIf anyone are willing to contribute, you can follow the instructions below:\r\n\r\n1. `git clone` the main branch\r\n2. Copy `language_template.json and rename them using the locale code in this list: https://www.science.co.il/language/Locale-codes.php\r\n3. Start translate! **Remember don't edit the `key`, just the value.**\r\n\r\n> You might notice there are some Regex syntax in the existing locale files. Basically, the dashboard will match the key to the texts in the UI, and replace the value using regex. So you can adjust the position of matching groups to better fit your language.\r\n> For example: `You can add up to (.*) peers` have one matching group which is matching a number between **to** and **peers**, and you can use `$1` in the value to represent the number.\r\n\r\nAfter you're done translating:\r\n\r\n1. Add your translation to `active_languages.json` by following this format\r\n\r\n```json\r\n[\r\n    {\r\n        \"lang_id\": \"zh-cn\",\r\n        \"lang_name\": \"Chinese (Simplified)\",\r\n        \"lang_name_localized\": \"中文 （简体）\"\r\n    }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Run the check script\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npython3 verify_locale_files.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt will tell you if your translation have missing translation or deprecated one, and it will insert or remove them directly for you:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npython3 verify_locale_files.py\r\n \r\n========================================================\r\n| WGDashboard Locale File Verification [by @donaldzou] |\r\n========================================================\r\n\r\nActive Languages\r\n\r\nCzech | cs\r\nGerman | de-de\r\nEnglish | en\r\nSpanish | es-es\r\nItalian | it-it\r\nDutch | nl-nl\r\nRussian | ru\r\nTurkish | tr-tr\r\nUkrainian | uk\r\nChinese (Simplified) | zh-cn\r\nChinese (Traditional) | zh-hk\r\nSwedish | sv-se\r\nPolish | pl\r\n\r\nPlease enter the language ID to verify: zh-cn\r\n\r\n\t[Missing Translations] 0 translation\r\n\t[Deprecated Translations] 0 translation\r\n\t[Note] All missing translations are added into zh-cn.json, all deprecated translations are removed from zh-cn.json\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease comment below if you have any questions \uD83D\uDE04 ",

The docs website might be a bit (or more) outdated, and we'd appreciate contributions to keep it up-to-date.\n\nWhile we still support direct deployment on the host, we recommend Docker-based deployment as the main way to install Photoview, as it gives perfect abstraction and unification across host OS and architectures. Nothing is ideal, but the Docker deployment is easier to maintain, so the direct deployment on the host is considered an advanced way for users, skilled and ready to solve some dependency and configuration issues, caused by their OS and architecture differences and nuances.", "Thanks for the quick reply, I really appreciate that you took the time to write to me in addition to volunteering to make this project a reality. I've setup \"Dockage\" partly to learn another tool, partly to speed things up by skipping some of the docker-specific commandline. Some of my issues with the timeline were simply filesystem permissions on the host as it turns out, which is a bit embarassing to overlook. However, after resolving the permissions, it also took renaming the folders to get PhotoView to re-synchronize the timeline and eliminate blank images in it. It's working as expected now! \n\nThank you again for the time and effort you put into this completely free and life improving software!\n\nTmanok", "Yes, I know that setting proper permissions for Photoview on the host FS level might not be so straightforward and clear for some of our users. I tried to describe the permission requirements as detailed as I was able to, providing alternative ways to make it work (creating a user with the same UID and GID or giving a read permission to everyone). However, I understand that this might still cause some misunderstanding.\n\n> it also took renaming the folders to get PhotoView to re-synchronize the timeline and eliminate blank images in it\n\nI didn't get this part: which folders did you have to rename? As far as I remember, if some media files fail to be scanned and appear with blank thumbnails, they should be scanned again by the following scan job run until they are successfully scanned or removed from the media library folder. So, in your case, once you fixed your host FS permissions, you just need to run the scan job again from the Settings page, and after it is finished, those files should appear with their thumbnails on the Timeline." ],

      "description" : "## Description \uD83D\uDCF9\n\n**Currently, verifying signatures on Starknet via `is_valid_signature` fails if the account is not deployed. This leads to the error: \"your wallet is not yet initialized, please make a transaction (sending ETH to yourself works) to initialize it.\" To support undeployed accounts, we propose directly verifying the signature using the public key (account address), bypassing the need to interact with the account's contract.**\n\n## Proposed Actions \uD83D\uDEE0️\n\nHere’s a checklist of actions to follow for resolving this issue:\n\n1. **Fork and Create Branch**:  \n   Fork the repository and create a new branch using the issue number:\n   \n```bash\n   git checkout -b fix-[issue-number]\n```\n\n2. **Implement Changes**:  \n- [ ] Create a utility function to verify Starknet signatures using public keys directly.\n- [ ] Integrate this function as a fallback when account is not yet deployed.\n- [ ] Detect if an account is deployed or not before calling `is_valid_signature`.\n- [ ] Add error handling and logging for both methods of verification.\n- [ ] Write unit tests for both deployed and undeployed account scenarios.\n\nExample snippet for direct signature verification:\n```python\ndef verify_signature(pubkey, message_hash, signature):\n    # Apply Starknet signature verification logic using elliptic curve math\n    return starknet_ec_verify(pubkey, message_hash, signature)\n```\n\n3. **Run Tests and Commit Changes**:  \n   Make sure your changes don't break existing functionality and commit with a clear message:\n   \n```bash\n   git commit -m \"Fix: Allow signature verification for undeployed Starknet accounts\"\n```\n\n## Required \uD83D\uDCCB\n\nTo keep our workflow smooth, please make sure you follow these guidelines:\n\n- **Assignment**: Don't create a pull request if you weren’t assigned to this issue.\n- **Timeframe**: Complete the task within **3 business days**.\n- **Closing the Issue**: In your PR description, close the issue by writing Close #[issue_id].\n- **Review Process**:\n  - Once you've submitted your PR, change the label to **\"ready for review\"**.\n  - If changes are requested, address them and then update the label back to **\"ready for review\"** once done.\n- **Testing**: Test your PR locally before pushing, and verify that tests and build are working after pushing.\n\nThank you for your contribution \uD83D\uDE4F\n\n⚠️ WARNING: Failure to follow the requirements above may result in being added to the OnlyDust blacklist, affecting your ability to receive future rewards.",

Offending code is usually references from Google APIs. One such violation that isn't currently covered is `URI`, but there may be others we should add that have slipped by.\n\n---------------\n\n_Do not alter or remove anything below. The following sections will be managed by moderators only._\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n\n* The list of acronyms that Site Kit enforces casing for is updated to include the following additional acronyms::\n  * `SDK` \n  * `EMM` \n  * `REST` \n  * `GKE` \n  * `URI`  \n  * `UX`  \n  * `OS` \n  * `GCP` \n  * `DNS`  \n  * `FCM`  \n  * `IAM` \n  * `IP` \n  * `ISO`\n\n## Implementation Brief\n\n* [x] In `packages/eslint-plugin/rules/acronym-case.js`\n  * Expand the list of Acronyms to include the items listed in AC https://github.com/google/site-kit-wp/blob/3eacb691d9d832ac0f473f17e54c1bb581205a89/packages/eslint-plugin/rules/acronym-case.js#L108\n\n\n### Test Coverage\n\n* Include few new acronyms to the list of existing tests in `packages/eslint-plugin/rules/acronym-case.test.js`\n\n## QA:Eng Brief\n\n* Run unit tests for `acronym-case.js`.\n* Confirm new acronyms (`SDK`, `EMM`, `REST`, `GKE`, `URI`, `UX`, `OS`, `GCP`, `DNS`, `FCM`, `IAM`, `IP`, `ISO`) are correctly flagged when casing is incorrect (e.g., `Sdk`).\n* Verify new acronyms pass when casing is correct (e.g., `sdk`, `SDK_CONSTANT`).\n* Ensure existing acronyms (e.g., `HTML`, `JSON`, `ID`) still behave as expected.\n* Check that ignored cases (imports, function calls, global objects) continue to be ignored.\n\n\n## Changelog entry\n\n* <!-- One sentence summarizing the PR, to be used in the changelog. -->\n",

Before I get started, could you clarify where this functionality would be used within Cake ?\n\nCurrently, `dotnet sln add/list/remove` commands are invoked directly via the CLI, so i'm not sure where parsing and serialization would come into play. Is this intended for a future feature, or is there an existing use case I might be missing ?\n\nThanks in advance" ],

I was exploring something similar, but as this is a new area for me, I'll aim to put together a basic working version of this experimentatal purpose soon.  \n\nThat said, it would be great if someone with more experience in this area could take the lead on this ticket.

I'll keep this open for someone with the right expertise to pick it.  \n\nIt also sounds like you’re looking for a **\"Copy\"** option, then I think some **JavaScript or TypeScript** knowledge would be helpful here.  \n\n**Is there anyone in-house who can take this on and help define the ACs?**  \n\n### Suggested Skill sets are (Feel free to amend the list below!):  \n- Open-Source LLM (or GPT-based text model)  \n- LangChain  \n- RAG  \n- JavaScript  \n- Python  \n\nLooking forward to any contributions!

Is it in the Python client or Javascript client? @pngwn ", "This is specifically for the javascript client. EDIT: API info for the python client will be made better in v4", "Nice, thanks @freddyaboulton ", "Hey, I would like to take this issue if it's still valid. ", "@DarhkVoyd definitely still valid! I'll add some additional details in a reply shortly!", "So I think the general idea was that it would be good to have response types typed, in order to do this we could need the client or the predict/ submit types to be generic.\r\n\r\nOriginally I was thinking that something like this would be cool:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { client } from '@gradio/client';\r\n\r\nconst app = client(...)\r\n\r\ntype Input = ['textbox', 'number', 'radio'];\r\ntype Output = ['image', 'textbox'];\r\n\r\nconst resp = await app.predict<[Input, Output]>(...)\r\n```\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> The following types are illustrative, I haven't checked to see if they are correct.\r\n\r\nthe input would be typed as:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ntype Input = [string, number, string]\r\n\r\n// type error\r\napp.predict([1, 2, 3])\r\n\r\n// correct\r\napp.predict([\"hi\", 23, \"cheese\"])\r\n```\r\n\r\nresponse data would be typed as:\r\n```ts\r\ninterface ImageData {\r\n  path: string;\r\n  name: string;\r\n  url: string;\r\n}\r\n\r\ntype TextboxData  = string;\r\n\r\ntype ResponseData = [ImageData, TextboxData];\r\n\r\n// type error\r\nresponse[2]\r\nresponse[1].key\r\nresponse[0].nsme\r\nresponse[0].name.match(..) // regex method\r\n\r\n// correct\r\nresponse[0].name\r\nresponse[0].name.toLowerCase()\r\nresponse[1].substr(...) // string method\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo essentially the input literals would become keys for specific types (that we would define somewhere) and we would map over those types to dynamically create the types for the inputs + returns values.\r\n\r\nAdditionally or optionally, I think it would be nice to be able to type the client directly, rather than needing to type every predict or submit call.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { client } from '@gradio/client';\r\n \r\ntype PredictInput = ...\r\ntype PredictOutput = ...\r\n\r\ntype OtherInput = ...\r\ntype OtherOutput = ...\r\n\r\nconst ClientResponseTypes {\r\n  \"/predict\" : [PredictInput, PredictOutput],\r\n  \"/other_endpoint\": [PredictInput, PredictOutput],\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI actually think the latter version (typing the client directly) is more universally useful, and we can also potentially generate the types via some command (we need this typing capability before we explore that though). So I would implement that first. We can always add additional stuff later.\r\n\r\nHope this is helpful. I would like to point out that we will be refactoring the client soon, it won't have enormous implications on this feature but it will result in some changes. Depending how soon you wanted to work on this, it might be better to wait until after that work has finished in order to avoid nasty conflicts. I also want to mention that this probably isn't the most straightforward of tasks, we already use generics extensively and this adds even more, they can be pretty tricky to work with for these kinds of purposes.\r\n\r\nHope this helps!", "@pngwn Hey, thank you so much for you insight. It's been a while so I just wanted to get right back. But I understand. I think I should just wait till the refactoring, I'll keep a watch. I would definitely tackle this carefully for the tricky part. Time to brush up my generics knowledge.", "Closed via https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/7646!

This also applies to the exemplars.\n\n## Actual Result\n\n\n### Collector version\n\nv0.119.0\n\n### Environment information\n\n_No response_\n\n### OpenTelemetry Collector configuration\n\n```yaml\n\n```\n\n### Log output\n\n```shell\n2025-05-12T18:45:34.719Z        warn    internal/metrics_model.go:159   DataPoint value type is unset, use 0.0 as default       {\"kind\": \"exporter\", \"data_type\": \"metrics\", \"name\": \"clickhouse\"}\n```\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

Write a brief description of how you will approach the task (without using ChatGPT).\n3. Add your Telegram handler in your application (e.g., in OnlyDust or similar)\n4. Write ETA in your application\n\n\n\n## What should I do if I have a problem\n1. Try to google it before asking. Googling is taking major part of dev work \n2. If you couldn't find answer your question with Google, text your question to [dev](https://t.me/spotnet_dev/4) group with your question.\n3. Do not send DM to maintainer, it would be better and faster to ask other contributors in chat \n\n\n## How to prepare PR\n1. Check if your code [smell](https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/smells) good\n2.  Add `close #<issue number>` to link your issue with your PR\n3.  Do not commit changes which is not related to your task \n4. Check after you created PR, if you committed everything.\n\n## Task Description\n1. Create a new `docker-compose.margin.yml` file in the [`devops`](https://github.com/djeck1432/spotnet/blob/main/devops) directory by duplicating the contents of the existing [`docker-compose.margin.back.yml`](https://github.com/djeck1432/spotnet/blob/main/devops/docker-compose.margin.back.yml).\n2. In [`docker-compose.margin.back.yml`](https://github.com/djeck1432/spotnet/blob/main/devops/docker-compose.margin.back.yml), remove the `frontend` service.",

We have labeled each network set with something like `networking.our.internal.stuff/networkset: <name>` to be able to select a single network set in our network policies. We are concerned that someone accidentally adds the same label to a pod or another resource and thus undermines our network policies.\n\n## Expected Behavior\n<!--- If you're describing a bug, tell us what should happen -->\n<!--- If you're suggesting a change/improvement, tell us how it should work -->\n\nIt would be cool if something similar to `projectcalico.org/orchestrator` exists that lets us specify the resource type we want to select. \n\n## Current Behavior\n<!--- If describing a bug, tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->\n<!--- If suggesting a change/improvement, explain the difference from current behavior -->\n\nWe can use `global()` to select across all global resources, but cannot limit this to just GlobalNetworkSets. We can use an external policy agent, like OPA or kyverno, to disallow setting our networkset labels on resources that are not network sets but this requires an additional system to be deployed.\n\n## Possible Solution\n<!--- Not obligatory, but suggest a fix/reason for the bug, -->\n<!--- or ideas how to implement the addition or change -->\n\nCalico could automatically add a new label, e.g. `projectcalico.org/kind` to each calico resource so that we can select resources by kind and their labels within the same selector. In our case, we could write a selector like `networking.our.internal.stuff/networkset == \"some-name\" && projectcalico.org/kind == \"GlobalNetworkSet\"`\n\nAnother solution would be something like a `kind(GlobalNetworkSet)` expression that does the same, but does not require an extra label.\n\n## Context\n<!--- How has this issue affected you? What are you trying to accomplish? -->\n<!--- Providing context helps us come up with a solution that is most useful in the real world -->\n\nWe want to be as strict as possible in our network policies and close any potential loophole that might exist in our setup.\n",

Their labels are not. It is possible to add the same label to two different network sets potentially allowing much more than expected. Something like `kind(GlobalNetworkSet) && name(Something)` as an expression would perfectly express what we want without allowing any potential misconfiguration.\n\nAgain, we can work around this using additional tooling (VAP/OPA/Kyverno) that verifies that the value of our `networking.our.internal.stuff/networkset` label exactly matches the name of a global network set, but built-in support for more precision when declaring network policies would be really nice!", "Hey guys,\n\nI'd love to try and work on this one.

However, We don't want to move all the configurations into the secrets, we need to carefully consider its implications for the broader user base and the project's long-term maintainability. It creates a split in where configuration parameters can originate, and users might not immediately inspect and know the specific settings.\nMoving some of the private configurations to secrets is a great suggestion though, if you guys have a better modification, feel free to discuss it with us!" ],

Instructions for that here:\nhttps://cve-bin-tool.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mismatch_data.html\n\nProbably doable by a beginner though I'll warn you, AI assistants likely won't know how to write mismatch files, so do read the instructions for that instead of letting copilot have at it.  Experienced folk, feel free to have at this one as well.  I'd rather have it fixed sooner rather than later.\n\n**Short tips for new contributors:**\n\n* [cve-bin-tool's contributor docs](https://github.com/intel/cve-bin-tool/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n* If you've contributed to open source but not this project, you might just want our [checklist for a great pull request](https://github.com/intel/cve-bin-tool/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#checklist-for-a-great-pull-request)\n* cve-bin-tool uses <https://www.conventionalcommits.org/> style for commit messages, and we have a test that checks the title of your pull request (PR).  A good potential title for this one is in the title of this issue.\n* You can make an issue auto close by including a comment \"fixes #ISSUENUMBER\" in your PR comments where ISSUENUMBER is the actual number of the issue.  This \"links\" the issue to the pull request.\n\n**Claiming issues:**\n\n* You do not need to have an issue assigned to you before you work on it.  To \"claim\" an issue either make a linked pull request or comment on the issue saying you'll be working on it.  \n* If someone else has already commented or opened a pull request, assume it is claimed and find another issue to work on.  \n* If it's been more than 1 week without progress, you can ask in a comment if the claimant is still working on it before claiming it yourself (give them at least 3 days to respond before assuming they have moved on).",

      "comments" : [ "This is documented as [anti savegame restore](https://docs.mikage.app/Anti_Savegame_Restore/). IIUC FS-HLE should write the values set by the game to the FS system save data, and then later return it. I don't think there's more to it, since the actual value checks are probably handled by the game itself?\n\nFor future compatibility with FS-LLE, it would be interesting to know what exactly the FS system save data for this looks like. Does FS create one file per game in its system save data, or does it use an internal format instead? Perhaps @ZeroSkill1 knows more?", "@neobrain I noticed some weird implementations on the FS side for secure values a while back, but I got busy so I left it unexplored until just now.\n\n- 0x865/0x866 require special permissions to use (or if the caller doesn't have them, at least the save ID set in the exheader) and read/write secure values only from the FS system save.\n- 0x86B/0x86C also require special permissions (save ID in the exheader does not suffice here) and read/write secure values directly to/from the save data DISA header and not the FS system save (the DISA header containing secure values [or hell, even gamecards being able to use secure values] is something that was previously *completely* unknown to my knowledge). (though you can force these two commands to read/write to/from the system save by setting the media type to 100, very strange)\n\n- 0x86E/0x86F read and write secure values:\n    - to/from the FS module system save data for media types SD & NAND\n    - to/from the DISA header for gamecards\n- 0x875/0x876 are identical to 0x86E/0x86F, except that instead of taking a media type and title ID, those are resolved through internal state using the given archive handle (which of course only works if the handle corresponds to a DISA).\n\nI've added the storage format for values in the DISA header to 3dbrew already.\nAs for the structure of the FS system save for secure values, this is the structure (which I will also add to 3dbrew soon):\n\n```c\ntypedef union secval_key {\n    u64 title_id;\n    struct {\n        u32 slot;\n        u32 unique_id;\n    } key_with_slot;\n} secval_key;\n\ntypedef struct secure_save {\n    u8 version;\n    u8 pads[3];\n    u32 count;\n    u32 unused[1022];\n    secval_key keys[0x3800];\n    u64 secure_values[0x3800];\n} secure_save;\n```\n\nSystem savedata ID 0x10011 is used (one of two FS module system saves, the other being SEEDDB), in which a file named just `DB` is created, consisting entirely of just the `secure_save` struct.\n", "Interesting findings, thanks so much for looking into it!\n\nI also cross-checked the [azahar sources](https://github.com/azahar-emu/azahar/blob/de7b457ee466e432047c4ee8d37fca9eae7e031e/src/core/file_sys/secure_value_backend.cpp) and it looks like they just return stub-implement these functions. Apparently this works because if you always report that no secure value has been saved yet, the game will happily initialize it and won't mind if you immediately forget it.\n\nSo to get the games running in Mikage, stubbing seems like a reasonable way forward as well. FS-LLE will eventually take care of proper emulation.\n" ],

For example, the scans in the `BackingLocatableResolverStoreTest` all return `null` instead of a real reason.\n\nIt's possible that this is a wider problem (for example, it may also apply to `BackingRecordStore`s), but I encountered this while writing tests of that store (see #3221).",

      "description" : "### \uD83E\uDDED Epic\n\n**Title:** Test Server Connectivity from Gateway UI  \n**Goal:** Help administrators debug server setup issues by interactively sending custom HTTP requests to configured MCP servers  \n**Why now:** When adding a new MCP server, it's often unclear if a given URL or endpoint is live, secure, or responding as expected. Today, users must use curl/Postman to debug. This feature allows testing any method, path, headers, or body directly from the Gateway UI.\n\n---\n\n### \uD83E\uDDED Type of Feature\n\n- [x] New functionality\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDE4B‍♂️ User Story 1\n\n**As a:** Gateway administrator  \n**I want:** to send custom HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.) to any path on the server I'm configuring  \n**So that:** I can debug connectivity, validate endpoint behavior, and inspect the actual server responses before saving\n\n#### ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n```gherkin\nScenario: Send a custom request to the server before saving\n  Given I am adding a new server in the Gateway UI\n  And I enter a server base URL\n  When I click \"Test Server\"\n  Then I should be able to:\n    - Choose an HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)\n    - Enter a relative path (e.g., /health)\n    - Provide optional headers and request body\n  When I click \"Send\"\n  Then the system sends the request to base_url + path\n  And I should see:\n    - HTTP status code\n    - Total response time (latency)\n    - Response body (pretty-printed JSON if possible)\n```\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDCD0 Design Sketch (optional)\n\n```\n+-------------------- Gateway UI ---------------------+\n| Server URL: https://api.example.com                |\n|                                                    |\n| [ Test Server ] ← opens test panel                 |\n+----------------------------------------------------+\n\n⇣ click\n\n+-------------------- Test Server --------------------+\n| Method: [GET ▼]                                     |\n| Path: /version                                      |\n| Headers (JSON): { \"Authorization\": \"Bearer xyz\" }  |\n| Body (JSON): { \"foo\": \"bar\" } (for POST, PUT...)   |\n| [ Send ]                                            |\n|                                                    |\n| ⇣ Results                                           |\n| ➤ Status: 200 OK                                    |\n| ➤ Latency: 120 ms                                   |\n| ➤ Response:                                         |\n| {                                                   |\n|   \"version\": \"1.0.0\",                               |\n|   \"status\": \"healthy\"                               |\n| }                                                   |\n+-----------------------------------------------------+\n```\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDD17 MCP Standards Check\n\n- [x] No impact on protocol or server discovery logic\n- [x] Safe, diagnostic-only feature\n- [x] Follows existing conventions for JSON and HTTP tooling\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDD04 Alternatives Considered\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons |\n|--------|------|------|\n| Predefined test list (/health, /version) | Simpler UI | Not flexible, less useful for real-world debugging |\n| Silent background ping | No UI work | Less control, can miss issues with specific headers/methods |\n| CLI-only debug tools | No frontend work | Fragments experience, not user-friendly\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDCD3 Additional Context\n\n- This is especially useful when:\n  - Testing authenticated or proxied servers\n  - Verifying custom response structures\n  - Diagnosing CORS or TLS errors from browser context\n- Future enhancements could include:\n  - Copy-as-curl button\n  - History of past test requests\n  - Auto-fill common headers like `Content-Type: application/json`\n",

This option is a type string.\r\nhttps://registry.terraform.io/providers/elastic/elasticstack/latest/docs/resources/fleet_integration\r\n\r\nQuestions are:  1) Could an value of \"latest\" or some other string be used in place of a specific numbered version to 'enable' terraform to Keep the integration(s) up to date?  2)  Could the Fleet API with 'keepPoliciesUpToDate' option be used to set/enable all integrations across the board to be kept update to date automatically?  3)  Is it advisable to try this or would there be any known or unintended consequences that might occur thereby making it something not to do or attempt?\r\n\r\nIt seems that since some of the integrations have the keep up to date feature and some do not, that there is a reason that not all integrations already have this Fleet UI toggle button.\r\n",

      "description" : "**Describe the bug**\n\n\n**To Reproduce**\n\n1. Checkout and build [Camunda Example Twitter](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/camunda-8-examples/tree/main/twitter-review-java-springboot)\n\n2. Set appropriate configuration properties to connect to your cluster/instance\n```\nzeebe.client.cloud.clusterId=...\nzeebe.client.cloud.clientId=SJqG7ve....\nzeebe.client.cloud.clientSecret=...\nzeebe.client.cloud.region=...\nzeebe.client.cloud.auth-url=...\nzeebe.client.cloud.base-url=...\n```\n\n3. Set environment variable \n```\nZEEBE_CLIENT_CONFIG_PATH=/tmp\n```\n\n4. Run the application and see some errors on the console regarding authentication issues.\n\n```\nat io.camunda.zeebe.client.impl.ZeebeClientFutureImpl.join(ZeebeClientFutureImpl.java:52) ~[zeebe-client-java-8.6.7.jar:8.6.7]\n\t... 32 common frames omitted\nCaused by: io.grpc.StatusRuntimeException: UNAUTHENTICATED: HTTP status code 401\ninvalid content-type: text/html\nheaders: Metadata(:status=401,date=Fri, 24 Jan 2025 14:49:06 GMT,content-type=text/html,www-authenticate=Bearer token_type=\"JWT\",strict-transport-security=max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains,content-length=172)\nDATA-----------------------------\n<html>\n<head><title>401 Authorization Required</title></head>\n<body>\n<center><h1>401 Authorization Required</h1></center>\n<hr><center>nginx</center>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n**Expected behavior**\n\nFor a better developer experience, the client should at least log an error to the console. But ideally should abort the bootstrapping with a useful error message mentioning which property is wrongly configured.\n\n**Log/Stacktrace**\n\n\n\uD83D\uDC40 \n**We do indeed raise an exception, when a directory is configured instead of a file (see [here](https://github.com/camunda/camunda/blob/ed8a807969f040fdb55b575a9e31fef957fd8d5e/clients/java/src/main/java/io/camunda/zeebe/client/impl/oauth/OAuthCredentialsProviderBuilder.java#L251)) and\nthe exception bubbles up to `PropertyUtil.java` (see [here](https://github.com/camunda/camunda/blob/cbef3b18134bbd4198456c293206bef2eab726f9/clients/spring-boot-starter-camunda-sdk/src/main/java/io/camunda/zeebe/spring/client/configuration/PropertyUtil.java#L98)) where the error is logged with `DEBUG` level!**\n\uD83D\uDC40 \n\nThus in order to see the message on the console the log level of the spring application needs to be changed\n(You will still see a lot of noise on the log, because the client still continues to bootstrap)\n\n```\nlogging.level.root=DEBUG\n```\n\nSee stack trace and error message below.\n\n<details><summary>Full Stacktrace</summary>\n

However, the expected value is ~10.8. Indeed, this is what we get if we set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nSince the model is being trained from initialization, the training loss at the first few steps should be around ~log(vocab_size)=10.8. However, when using 4 GPUs, the reported loss is 1/4 of that (2.7).\n\nThe reason that this is happening is that the DataParallel-wrapped model gets `num_items_in_batch` as an input kwarg in `Trainer.compute_loss`; this is equal to the number of tokens in the batch (combined across all devices). Each device gets a 1/4-size per-device batch and returns the sum of token losses divided by `num_items_in_batch` (see `transformers.loss.loss_utils.fixed_cross_entropy`). The correct way to aggregate these per-device losses is then to *sum* them. However, `Trainer.training_step` takes the mean:\nhttps://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/953196a43dae6a3c474165fba7d215fcbc7b7730/src/transformers/trainer.py#L3759\n\nA quick and dirty fix would be:\n```\nif self.args.n_gpu > 1:\n    loss = loss.mean() if num_items_in_batch is None else loss.sum()\n```\nI'm not sure if this is compatible with other workflows though.",

We only combine if you set `average_tokens_across_devices=True`. However, the default for this arg is False.\n\nDid you test both runs with the same `per_device_train_batch_size` ? You need to divide it by 4 when running with 4 gpus to be comparable. Otherwise, you are actually using a bigger global batch size. However, I don't think this is the real issue.", "@SunMarc Thanks for taking a look at this. (And apologies for the delayed reply -- somehow I didn't get a notification about your response.)\n\nI am dividing the `per_device_train_batch_size` by 4 for 4 gpus, but as you said I don't think this is the root cause.\nAlso I have the default setting `average_tokens_across_devices=False`.\n\nWhen I run my above example code, the behavior I'm observing is:\n- `Trainer.compute_loss` is called with `num_items_in_batch=(inputs['labels'] != -100).sum()`\n- Inside `compute_loss`, it runs `outputs = model(**inputs); loss = outputs[\"loss\"]`\n- In my example, `model` is a `DataParallel` object wrapping a `GPTNeoXForCausalLM`. I don't construct a `DataParallel` explicitly, so I'm guessing that `Trainer` automatically does this somewhere when it detects multiple devices?\n- `DataParallel` splits  `input_ids` into 4 chunks for the 4 gpus, **but it does not modify `num_items_in_batch`**\n- Thus `GPTNeoXForCausalLM.forward` calls `self.loss_function` using `input_ids` for just 1 gpu but `num_items_in_batch` equal to the sum across all gpus.\n\nAre you able to replicate this behavior on your end? I've provided the full example code (except imports) above.\n\nAlso, maybe I'm incorrectly using `Trainer` for multi-device training? Is there a different config that I should be using?", "I'll check !

I'm [Dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot) and I’m helping the dify team.\n\n<!-- Answer -->\nThe error happens because Dify expects the NOTION_CLIENT_ID environment variable to be set for Notion OAuth, but it's missing, empty, or set to 0 in your Docker environment. This causes Dify to send an invalid OAuth request to Notion, resulting in the error you see [\"client_id should be a string or undefined, instead was 0\"](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/blob/1a7ad195f01cd6d246860ac16ba3371826c34295/api/controllers/console/auth/data_source_oauth.py).\n\nTo fix this, set NOTION_CLIENT_ID (and NOTION_CLIENT_SECRET) in your environment. For Docker Compose, add these lines to your `.env` file or the `environment:` section of your `docker-compose.yml`:\n\n```\nNOTION_CLIENT_ID=your_notion_client_id\nNOTION_CLIENT_SECRET=your_notion_client_secret\n```\n\nAfter updating, restart your containers to apply the changes. You can verify the variables are loaded by running `docker compose exec <service> env | grep NOTION` and checking your logs for config loading.\n\nIf you still see the error, double-check for typos, whitespace, or formatting issues in your environment variables. For more details, see the relevant code and config handling [here](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/blob/1a7ad195f01cd6d246860ac16ba3371826c34295/api/configs/extra/notion_config.py) and [here](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/blob/1a7ad195f01cd6d246860ac16ba3371826c34295/api/libs/oauth_data_source.py).\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

I have setup RBAC in the gke cluster to give that iam account permissions using the method shown here https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/role-based-access-control#rolebinding. However, when running GKEStartJobOperator it seems to call the GKE cluster with the unqiue id of the service account in the impersonation chain rather than the email. This causes the RBAC to fail as it cant match the User. It works if i put the unqiue id directly as a user subject.\n\n### What you think should happen instead?\n\nThe follow error happens `User \\”<unique_id>\\” cannot create resource \\\"jobs\\\" in API group \\\"batch\\\" in the namespace \\\"airflow-jobs\\\": requires one of [\\\"container.jobs.create\\\"] permission(s).` I expected it to use the email in the impersonation chain rather than the unique id.\n\n### How to reproduce\n\n1. set up rbac as follows\n```\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nkind: Role\nmetadata:\n  namespace: airflow-jobs\n  name: job-creator\nrules:\n  - apiGroups: [ \"batch\" ]\n    resources: [ \"jobs\", ]\n    verbs: [ \"create\" , \"list\", \"get\", \"update\", \"patch\", \"delete\"]\n  - apiGroups: [ \"batch\" ]\n    resources: [ \"jobs/status\" ]\n    verbs: [ \"get\" ]\n  - apiGroups: [ \"\" ]\n    resources: [ \"pods\" ]\n    verbs: [ \"list\", \"get\"]\n---\nkind: RoleBinding\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nmetadata:\n  name: job-creator-binding\n  namespace: airflow-jobs\nsubjects:\n  - kind: User\n    name: <iam-service-account>\n    namespace: airflow-jobs\nroleRef:\n  kind: Role\n  name: job-creator\n  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io\n```\n2.  create a dag with operator configure with impersonation chain\n```\njob_task = GKEStartJobOperator(\n        task_id=\"job_task\",\n        project_id=“<project-id>,\n        location=\"europe-west1\",\n        cluster_name=“<gke-cluster-name>“,\n        namespace=\"airflow-jobs\",\n        image=\"perl:5.34.0\",\n        cmds=[\"perl\", \"-Mbignum=bpi\", \"-wle\", \"print bpi(2000)\"],\n        name=\"test-job\",\n        ttl_seconds_after_finished=60,\n        wait_until_job_complete=True,\n        deferrable=True,\n        impersonation_chain=“<iam service account>”,\n    )\n```\n\n### Operating System\n\nlinux\n\n### Versions of Apache Airflow Providers\n\napache-airflow==2.10.5+composer\napache-airflow-providers-apache-beam==6.0.4\napache-airflow-providers-celery==3.10.0\napache-airflow-providers-cncf-kubernetes==10.1.0\napache-airflow-providers-common-compat==1.6.0\napache-airflow-providers-common-io==1.5.4\napache-airflow-providers-common-sql==1.26.0\napache-airflow-providers-dbt-cloud==4.3.3\napache-airflow-providers-fab==1.5.3\napache-airflow-providers-ftp==3.12.3\napache-airflow-providers-google==15.1.0\napache-airflow-providers-hashicorp==4.1.1\napache-airflow-providers-http==5.2.2\napache-airflow-providers-imap==3.8.3\napache-airflow-providers-mysql==6.2.2\napache-airflow-providers-openlineage==2.2.0\napache-airflow-providers-postgres==6.1.3\napache-airflow-providers-redis==4.0.2\napache-airflow-providers-sendgrid==4.0.1\napache-airflow-providers-smtp==2.0.3\napache-airflow-providers-sqlite==4.0.2\napache-airflow-providers-ssh==4.0.1\napache-airflow-providers-standard==1.0.0\n\n### Deployment\n\nGoogle Cloud Composer\n\n### Deployment details\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Are you willing to submit PR?\n\n- [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n",

For `Beam` we follow the BTLx standard of defining a beam `Beam.frame` corresponds the project's coordinate system:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb47a469-7b26-4a9b-9ad6-536220832d39)\n\nfrom: https://www.design2machine.com/btlx/BTLx_2_2_0.pdf\n\nif you'd like to give it a try I invite you to create a PR and I'll be happy to review it :) let me know if you have any questions.\n " ],

Having the ability to configure the stemming language based on the language of each record individually, but without using multiple indices or duplicate fields, allows for less overhead during index creation.\r\n\r\n### What is your proposed implementation for this feature?\r\n\r\nHaving an additional parameter in the tokenizer, \"stemmer_config\", that takes a column from the table, which contains the language of each record, would be sufficient for our use case. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCALL paradedb.create_bm25(\r\n    index_name => 'reports_search_idx',\r\n    table_name => 'reports',\r\n    key_field => 'id',\r\n    text_fields => paradedb.field(\r\n        name => 'body', \r\n        paradedb.tokenizer('default', stemmer_config => 'language')\r\n    ));\r\n```\r\nOf course this field must be defined for each record that is added to the table as well.\r\n### Full Name:\r\n\r\nKonstantin Dibbern\r\n\r\n### Affiliation:\r\n\r\nN/A",

      "description" : "## Issue summary\n- While designing the statement distribution subsystem I've noticed that it needs to send messages to `Candidate Backing` subsystems, and after a look into the `Candidate Backing` it will also need to send messages to `Statement Distribution`\n\n- Currently, in Gossamer we have packages contains a filed `message.go` that contains all the messages the subsystem can receive, and other packages that contains an inner package called `messages` that holds a file called `messages.go` that contains the messages.\n\n- In a case where two subsystems should send messages to each other they need to import the receiving subsystem to be able to instantiate the message and sent, so if all the messages stay in the subsystem package this will create an cyclic import\n\n\n## Implementation details\n\n- We should use the second approach where the subsystem has an inner package called `messages` to avoid such case.\n\n## Other information and links\n<!-- Add any other context, links or screenshots about the issue here. -->\n- `Backing -> Statement Distribution`: [link to the code](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/ec69b612bfa082ada07ceb7d8115e07f943f6815/polkadot/node/core/backing/src/lib.rs#L1697)\n- `Statement Distribution -> Backing`: [link to the code](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/ec69b612bfa082ada07ceb7d8115e07f943f6815/polkadot/node/network/statement-distribution/src/v2/mod.rs#L1959)\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n<!-- Acceptance criteria establish conditions to fulfill for the item to be complete. Usually can be a list of checkboxes.\nPlease refer to DOD for general implementation issue:\n- AC should be complete so list everything that this issue suppose to have\n- 60% test coverage. No less then 60% of coverage for newly added lines\n- If applicable Regression testing. If this issue can be tested by its won mention Regression testing. \nAcceptance criteria should be added as a check boxes (eg [] Do this) \n-->\n[] Move all the messages for each subsystems to the `messages` pkg\n\n<!-- Thank you \uD83D\uDE4F -->",

      "description" : "### \uD83E\uDDED Epic\n\n**Title:** Configurable Connection-Retry Back-off for Database & Redis  \n**Goal:** Prevent gateway startup failures caused by slow-to-start services by making retry limits and intervals fully configurable. \n**Why now:** In containerised deployments Postgres (or any other SQL backend) and Redis often take several seconds to accept TCP connections. Today the gateway gives up on the first failure, crashing with `psycopg2.OperationalError: connection … refused`. Operators need a simple way—via environment variables, just like `DB_POOL_SIZE`, `CACHE_TYPE`, etc.—to tune how many times and how often the gateway retries before aborting.\n\n---\n\n### \uD83E\uDDED Type of Feature\n\n- [x] Enhancement to existing functionality\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDE4B‍♂️ User Story 1\n\n**As a:** DevOps engineer running MCP Gateway in Kubernetes  \n**I want:** to set `DB_MAX_RETRIES` and `DB_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS` for any SQLAlchemy-backed database  \n**So that:** the application patiently waits until the database container is ready, instead of crashing and restarting in a loop\n\n#### ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n```gherkin\nScenario: Database retries during startup\nGiven MCP Gateway starts with DB_MAX_RETRIES=10 and DB_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS=5000\nAnd the database is not yet ready\nWhen the first connection attempt fails\nThen the gateway should log \"DB connection failed (attempt 1/10), retrying in 5 s\"\nAnd it should retry every 5 s\nAnd after 10 failed attempts it should exit with a clear error message\n```\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDE4B‍♂️ User Story 2\n\n**As a:** Site Reliability Engineer using Redis caching  \n**I want:** analogous knobs `REDIS_MAX_RETRIES` and `REDIS_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS`  \n**So that:** the gateway’s cache layer behaves consistently with the database layer\n\n#### ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n```gherkin\nScenario: Redis retries respect custom settings\nGiven REDIS_MAX_RETRIES=15 and REDIS_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS=2000\nAnd Redis is unavailable\nWhen the cache subsystem initialises\nThen it must retry up to 15 times at 2 s intervals\nAnd surface a single aggregated error if all attempts fail\n```\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDE4B‍♂️ User Story 3\n\n**As a:** Platform administrator  \n**I want:** sensible defaults (3 retries × 2000 ms) so I don’t have to set anything for typical installs  \n**So that:** small deployments gain resilience out-of-the-box\n\n#### ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n```\n\nScenario: Defaults work when variables are unset\nGiven none of the four *_RETRIES or *_INTERVAL_MS variables are set\nWhen the gateway cannot reach the database\nThen it retries 3 times with 2 s between attempts\n\n```\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDCD0 Design Sketch (optional)\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\nsubgraph Settings\nENV[\".env / ENV vars\"]\nend\nENV --> Config[config.py load Settings]\nConfig -->|DB config| DBClient[SQLAlchemy Engine]\nConfig -->|Cache config| RedisClient[Redis Async Client]\n\nDBClient --> RetryLogic\nRedisClient --> RetryLogic\n\nRetryLogic{{\"Retry up to N timesnsleep(interval_ms)\"}}\nRetryLogic --> Logger\n```\n\n| Component | Change | Detail |\n|----------|--------|--------|\n| `config.py` | Add four `@env_settings` fields | `db_max_retries:int=3`, `db_retry_interval_ms:int=2000`, `redis_max_retries:int=3`, `redis_retry_interval_ms:int=2000` |\n| `db.py` | Wrap DB connect logic in retry loop | Use `asyncio.sleep()` for interval |\n| Redis cache init | Retry connect with same config | Applies if `CACHE_TYPE=redis` |\n| Logging | One log per retry attempt | Include attempt count and retry delay |\n| README | Add env var docs | Match style of existing DB/Redis config\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDD17 MCP Standards Check\n\n- [x] No protocol-level breaking changes\n- [x] Follows existing env var config conventions\n- [ ] Deviations: none\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDD04 Alternatives Considered\n\n| Alternative | Pros | Cons |\n|------------|------|------|\n| `docker-compose` healthcheck + `depends_on` | Simple for local dev | Doesn’t help bare-metal or k8s |\n| Exponential back-off | Faster in some cases | Adds complexity |\n| Gunicorn retry preload script | Works for some runners | Not general-purpose\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDCD3 Additional Context\n\n- Mirrors retry pattern used in `max_tool_retries`\n- Naming aligned with `DB_POOL_SIZE`, `CACHE_TYPE`, etc.\n- Ensure this is then changed in the helm chart.\n\nExample configuration:\n\n```bash\nexport DB_MAX_RETRIES=10\nexport DB_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS=5000\nexport REDIS_MAX_RETRIES=10\nexport REDIS_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS=5000\n```\n",

Upon receiving the content, `dfdaemon` writes the file to its configured storage location.\n\n### Link\n\nClient Repo: https://github.com/dragonflyoss/client",

      "description" : "### Description\n\n_This feature only needs to be implemented on the [Rust Client](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/client)._\n\nIntroduce a new `memory` storage type for Dragonfly Peers. This allows users to configure a specific capacity for an in-memory cache.\n\n**Key Requirements:**\n\n1.  **Configuration:** Add a configuration option to select `memory` as the storage type and specify its maximum capacity.\n2.  **LRU Cache(Memory):** When a Peer starts with the `memory` storage type enabled, it should automatically create cache storage with the configured capacity.\n4.  **Garbage Collection (GC):** Implement a GC mechanism specifically for the `memory` storage. This GC process should evict data based on two strategies:    *   **Time-To-Live (TTL):** Remove data that has exceeded its defined lifespan.\n    *   **Capacity:** Remove data (e.g., using an LRU or similar policy) when the storage utilization approaches its configured capacity limit.\n\nRefer to https://github.com/dragonflyoss/client/blob/main/dragonfly-client-config/src/dfdaemon.rs#L1000.\n\n4.  **Download Integration:** Modify all download entry points and processing logic within the Peer. When a download request specifies or defaults to the `memory` storage type, the downloaded data must be written to and read from the cache storage instead of the traditional disk-based storage.\n\n**Benefit:**\n\nUsing memory storage bypasses disk I/O, enabling significantly faster read and write operations for cached files, improving overall P2P distribution performance, especially for latency-sensitive workloads.\n\n### Link\n\nClient Repo: Client Repo: https://github.com/dragonflyoss/client",

I’ve been exploring CARE and love how it’s transforming healthcare management. With my background in ReactJS and Django (e.g., I optimized a React app to handle large datasets at Modern Vibe Homes), I’d love to tackle this and make those tables sing with all the data they deserve!\n\nHere’s how I’d crush it:\n\n1. **Diagnose the Limit**: Dig into the backend (likely Django) to confirm the 14-item cap—probably a pagination default in the API.\n2. **Boost the Fetch**: Update the API endpoint to support dynamic limits (e.g., `?limit=50`) or fetch all items with a single call if feasible.\n3. **Frontend Flow**: Tweak the React frontend to handle paginated or full data—maybe add a “Load More” button for smooth UX.\n4. **Test the Fix**: Verify with the example encounter ([this link](https://care.ohc.network/facility/605215bd-6215-45dd-bc20-aaeceb474ca1/patient/f3d6590d-adcd-4e0d-9eb3-a5f003dbbee8/encounter/235e330a-4924-4c1a-a871-defead90a16c/updates)) to ensure all allergies show up.\n5. **Polish It**: Optimize performance so it’s snappy even with 50+ items—because healthcare pros need speed!\n\nThis fix could unlock a seamless experience for users tracking tons of allergies or diagnoses—I’m pumped to see it through! Could I take a stab at a PR for this? I’m also eyeing GSoC 2025 with CARE—any chance to chat with the team about this or other ideas? Can’t wait to collab and boost CARE’s impact!\n\nThanks", "@nihal467  can i contribute to this issue?\n", "Hey, I'd love to work on this issue!

      "description" : "**Describe the feature you are requesting**\n\nLog entries for the load balancer controller are in JSON format and one of the fields is `level` which contains a severity level. There is a `--log-level` parameter supported as a runtime argument for the tool. However, that log level argument currently only supports setting either `info` or `debug` levels and not `warn` or `error`.\n\nA bug was raised about this in 2021: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-load-balancer-controller/issues/1820\n\nAs far as I can see, the logging remains the same in version v2.11.0 - info level messages are printed to stdout when passing `--log-level=warn`.\n\nThat previous issue describes the situation as follows:\n\n> the log-level flag currently can have only two values - info or debug. If anything else is specified, the debug level gets set on the logger. That is why you see debug logs when you specify level of error [...]\n> \n> [...] due to the limitations of the current logging packages, we won't be able to safely support multiple log levels (other than info and debug) in the short term.\n\nFour years later, I came across this ticket and wanted to ask whether there's plans to change this behavior on the roadmap.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nBeing able to configure verbosity for third party applications like the Load Balancer Controller helps users keep log aggregation costs and query times down.\n\n**Describe the proposed solution you'd like**\n\n* Configurable log levels to include `warn` and `error`\n* Documentation to clear supported log levels clearly\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\nCurrently if needed, my team filters out `info` level messages in our log aggregation tool. However, that either ends up very verbose (if we want a granular approach with per-chart log filtering) or very blunt (dropping those log levels for all applications, when we may want to collect more granular information from one application than another).\n\n**Contribution Intention (Optional)**\n\n-[ ] Yes, I am willing to contribute a PR to implement this feature\n-[x] No, I cannot work on a PR at this time\n\nI would be happy to help investigate options for this, but I don't have any background in go, so I would not be able to commit to implementing this myself.",
