However the [code](https://docs.rs/crate/object_store/0.12.0/source/src/client/retry.rs#374-403) does not implement this (if the error is not an HTTP 4xx or 5xx, it exits without retrying on L390).\n\nA typical example of a non-retried error I saw in practice is:\n```\nService(ObjectStore(Generic { store: \"S3\", source: RetryError { method: PUT, uri: Some(XXX-REDACTED-XXX), retries: 0, max_retries: 3, elapsed: 801.473??s, retry_timeout: 60s, inner: Http(HttpError { kind: Unknown, source: reqwest::Error { kind: Request, source: hyper_util::client::legacy::Error(SendRequest, hyper::Error(Io, Os { code: 104, kind: ConnectionReset, message: \"Connection reset by peer\" })) } }) } }))\n```\n\nIs there interest in making the behavior match the documentation? Otherwise it'd be good to edit the documentation to match the behavior. I prefer the former, but either way I'd be happy to chip in.",

Check that no other contributor is working on this issue. If someone is assigned to the issue or claimed to be working on it, ping the person. After one week without a response, the assignee may be changed.\n1. Leave a comment indicating that you are working on the issue, or just create a [pull request](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pulls) after following the steps below. [Mention](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) this issue in the description of the pull request.\n1. Fix the issue locally.\n1. [Run the test suite](https://llvm.org/docs/TestingGuide.html#unit-and-regression-tests) locally. Remember that the subdirectories under `test/` create fine-grained testing targets, so you can e.g. use `make check-clang-ast` to only run Clang's AST tests.\n1. Create a Git commit.\n1. Run [`git clang-format HEAD~1`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html#git-integration) to format your changes.\n1. Open a [pull request](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pulls) to the [upstream repository](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project) on GitHub. Detailed instructions can be found [in GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

I was busy in the last days, but my plan is to return to it in the coming week. Thank you for your patience!", "No problem @ionixjunior take your time there is no rush", "@FilippoZazzeroni we have our first big challenge in this issue, and I'd like to suggest an approach.\n\nThe biggest function we have is `gleanRecordEvent` from `TelemetryWrapper.swift` which currently spans 982 lines. \n\nThis function contains a large switch case statement with a lot of marks (bookmarks, reader mode, reading list, etc). So, how about to start thinking to split this large switch case statement into small functions based on their marks. Example:\n\n```swift\nstatic func gleanRecordEvent(category: EventCategory,\n                             method: EventMethod,\n                             object: EventObject,\n                             value: EventValue? = nil,\n                             extras: [String: Any]? = nil) {\n    if (handleBookmarksActions(category: category, method: method, object: object, value: value, extras: extras)) { return }\n    if (handleReaderModeActions(category: category, method: method, object: object, value: value, extras: extras)) { return }\n    // other actions here...\n    \n    recordUninstrumentedMetrics(category: category, method: method, object: object, value: value, extras: extras)\n}\n\nprivate static func handleBookmarksActions(category: EventCategory,\n                                           method: EventMethod,\n                                           object: EventObject,\n                                           value: EventValue?,\n                                           extras: [String: Any]?) -> Bool {\n    switch (category, method, object, value, extras) {\n    case (.action, .view, .bookmarksPanel, let from?, _):\n        GleanMetrics.Bookmarks.viewList[from.rawValue].add()\n        return true\n    case (.action, .add, .bookmark, let from?, _):\n        GleanMetrics.Bookmarks.add[from.rawValue].add()\n        return true\n    case(.information, .view, .mobileBookmarks, .doesHaveMobileBookmarks, _):\n        GleanMetrics.Bookmarks.hasMobileBookmarks.set(true)\n        return true\n    case(.information, .view, .mobileBookmarks, .doesNotHaveMobileBookmarks, _):\n        GleanMetrics.Bookmarks.hasMobileBookmarks.set(false)\n        return true\n    case(.information, .view, .mobileBookmarks, .mobileBookmarksCount, let extras):\n        if let quantity = extras?[EventExtraKey.mobileBookmarksQuantity.rawValue] as? Int64 {\n            GleanMetrics.Bookmarks.mobileBookmarksCount.set(quantity)\n        }\n        return true\n    default:\n        return false\n    }\n}\n\nprivate static func handleReaderModeActions(category: EventCategory,\n                                            method: EventMethod,\n                                            object: EventObject,\n                                            value: EventValue?,\n                                            extras: [String: Any]?) -> Bool {\n    switch (category, method, object, value, extras) {\n    case (.action, .tap, .readerModeOpenButton, _, _):\n        GleanMetrics.ReaderMode.open.add()\n        return true\n    case (.action, .tap, .readerModeCloseButton, _, _):\n        GleanMetrics.ReaderMode.close.add()\n        return true\n    default:\n        return false\n    }\n}\n```\n\nI believe we already discussed about some similar approach previously, but we decided to avoid it. Looking to this approach, a downside is allow duplicated switch case statements undetected by the compiler, and more complexity. What do you think?" ],

      "comments" : [ "# :wave: Important: PLEASE READ :wave:\n\nThis issue has been labeled as a **good first issue** and is available for anyone to work on.\n\nIf this is your first time contributing to an open source project, some aspects of the development process may seem unusual, arcane, or some combination of both.\n\n1.  **You cannot \"claim\" issues.** People new to open source often want to \"claim\" or be assigned an issue before beginning work. The typical rationale is that people want to avoid wasted work in the event that someone else ends up working the issue. However, this practice is not effective in open source, as it often leads to \"issue squatting\", in which an individual asks to be assigned, is granted their request, and then never ends up working on the issue. Accordingly, you are encouraged to communicate your intent to address this issue, ideally by providing a rough outline as to how you plan to address the issue or asking clarifying questions, but, at the end of the day, we will take running code and rough consensus in order to move forward quickly.\n2.  **We have a very high bar for contributions.** We have very high standards for contributions and expect all contributions???whether new features, tests, or documentation???to be rigorous, thorough, and complete. Once a pull request is merged into stdlib, that contribution immediately becomes the collective responsibility of all maintainers of stdlib. When we merge code into stdlib, we are saying that we, the maintainers, commit to reviewing subsequent changes and making bugfixes to the code. Hence, in order to ensure future maintainability, this naturally leads to a higher standard of contribution.\n\nBefore working on this issue and opening a pull request, please read the project's [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md). These guidelines and the associated [development guide](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/docs/contributing/development.md) provide important information, including links to stdlib's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), license policy, and steps for setting up your local development environment.\n\nTo reiterate, we **strongly** encourage you to refer to our contributing guides **before** beginning work on this issue. Failure to follow our guidelines significantly decreases the likelihood that you'll successfully contribute to stdlib and may result in automatic closure of a pull request without review.\n\nSetting up your local development environment is a critical first step, as doing so ensures that automated development processes for linting, license verification, and unit testing can run prior to authoring commits and pushing changes. If you would prefer to avoid manual setup, we provide pre-configured [development containers](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/tree/develop/.devcontainer) for use locally or in GitHub Codespaces.\n\nWe place a high value on consistency throughout the stdlib codebase. We encourage you to closely examine other packages in stdlib and attempt to emulate the practices and conventions found therein.\n\n-   If you are attempting to contribute a new package, sometimes the best approach is to simply copy the contents of an existing package and then modify the minimum amount necessary to implement the feature (e.g., changing descriptions, parameter names, and implementation).\n-   If you are contributing tests, find a package implementing a similar feature and emulate the tests of that package.\n-   If you are updating documentation, examine several similar packages and emulate the content, style, and prose of those packages.\n\nIn short, the more effort you put in to ensure that your contribution looks and feels like stdlib???including variables names, bracket spacing, line breaks, etc???the more likely that your contribution will be reviewed and ultimately accepted. We encourage you to closely study the codebase **before** beginning work on this issue.\n\n:sparkles: Thank you again for your interest in stdlib, and we look forward to reviewing your future contributions. :sparkles:\n" ],

I am open to anyone who wants to contribute! Feel free to comment here and I'll provide full support!", "Hey @domferr, I'd like to start working on this feature and it would be great to have a feedback from early ideas and potential implementation.\n\nBy the way I've never use TypeScript/JavaScript, but I did a lot of C/C++/Python/Rust so even if I'm ok doing this, feel free to make any comments as there may be some TypeScript-specific concepts I'm not aware of !\n\n### UI side\n\nI was thinking about:\n\n- adding a toggle between `Width` and `Border color` called `Automatic border color`\n- renaming `Border color` to `Custom border color`\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a02259c-e745-4640-8494-03849352e624)\n\nThe extension would then automatically synchronize the color with the global accent color when the toggle is activated, or use the custom border color when deactivated.\n\n### Backend side\n\nSome settings would be added/modified:\n\n- add a new setting called `WINDOW_BORDER_COLOR_AUTO` (or some other variant name if you prefer) that would hold the toggle state and would be register in the gschema\n- rename `WINDOW_BORDER_COLOR` to `WINDOW_BORDER_COLOR_CUSTOM`\n- add a new setting called `WINDOW_BORDER_COLOR` that would return `WINDOW_BORDER_COLOR_CUSTOM` or the global accent color based on `WINDOW_BORDER_COLOR_AUTO` state\n\nHere I differenciate the general color from the custom color, so the previously user-defined color isn't overwritten when auto coloring is used.\n\nLooking at [GNOME-Auto-Accent-Color implementation](https://github.com/Wartybix/GNOME-Auto-Accent-Colour/blob/10ee080c75be09038c2d13f635b75ae9e93f81e5/extension.js#L356), it looks like it's a simple call to `Gio.Settings({ schema: INTERFACE_SCHEMA }).get_string(ACCENT_COLOR)`.\nPlus some [signal management](https://github.com/Wartybix/GNOME-Auto-Accent-Colour/blob/10ee080c75be09038c2d13f635b75ae9e93f81e5/extension.js#L529) when the accent color is changed after startup.\n\nWhat do you think about this ?", "Hey, first of all, thank you so much! \n\nYour idea of changing the current WINDOW_BORDER_COLOR to return WINDOW_BORDER_COLOR_CUSTOM or the global accent color based on WINDOW_BORDER_COLOR_AUTO state is a cool idea!\n\n## How Tiling Shell stores the window border color setting\n\nWhat you see in the preferences window is a pair, the setting key and its value. The key is stored in [`Settings.KEY_WINDOW_BORDER_COLOR`](https://github.com/domferr/tilingshell/blob/c12f6eecde7279aed0bf5dd8e3631c2551afe068/src/settings/settings.ts#L81). It must match with the key specified in Tiling Shell gschema [here](https://github.com/domferr/tilingshell/blob/c12f6eecde7279aed0bf5dd8e3631c2551afe068/resources/schemas/org.gnome.shell.extensions.tilingshell.gschema.xml#L135).\n\nTo add a new setting (for example the boolean you called `WINDOW_BORDER_COLOR_AUTO`) you can follow the guide I wrote [here](https://github.com/domferr/tilingshell/blob/main/README.md#how-to-add-new-keybindings) but just the steps 1 and 2.\n\n## How Tiling Shell shows the window border color\n\nThe management of window border is in [`WindowBorderManager`](https://github.com/domferr/tilingshell/blob/c12f6eecde7279aed0bf5dd8e3631c2551afe068/src/components/windowBorderManager.ts#L382) class. [Here](https://github.com/domferr/tilingshell/blob/c12f6eecde7279aed0bf5dd8e3631c2551afe068/src/components/windowBorderManager.ts#L350) is where I set the border color according to the user setting. The class `Settings` has the goal to make extremely easy (like one line of code) to get and set the settings and listen to the user changes of the setting. It exposes a static field for each setting and its getter and setter (like [here](https://github.com/domferr/tilingshell/blob/c12f6eecde7279aed0bf5dd8e3631c2551afe068/src/settings/settings.ts#L361-L367)) gets/sets the value from/to Gio.Settings.\n\n## GNOME's accent color setting\n\nFrom your link, then, I can say that it looks like GNOME 47+ stores the accent color to the schema `org.gnome.desktop.interface`, with key `accent-color`. I don't have GNOME 47 so it might be worth to double check if you can! (using tools like dconf or getting the key value from terminal, let me know if you need help on this)\n\n## Signal management: listen to `accent-color` changes\n\nHaving that association there is awesome! In Tiling Shell there is already another example of signal management to listen to changes of `Gio.Settings` keys, have a look [here](https://github.com/domferr/tilingshell/blob/c12f6eecde7279aed0bf5dd8e3631c2551afe068/src/extension.ts#L170C9-L173)! Something like this then:\n\n```\nthis._signals.connect(\n            new Gio.Settings({ schema: 'org.gnome.desktop.interface' }),\n            'changed::accent-color',\n            (_interfaceSettings: Gio.Settings) => {\n                    ... this code here is executed when the accent-color key changes its value\n            }\n);\n```\n\n`_signals` is an object of class [`SignalHandling`](https://github.com/domferr/tilingshell/blob/main/src/utils/signalHandling.ts#L7) which I created to have a class that simplifies connecting and disconnecting to signals. You can find it already used in WindowBorderManager class.\n\n## Add a new setting in the preferences\n\nAll the code of the preferences window is in `src/prefs.ts` file.\n\n## How to react to the user enabling or disabling the use of the accent color\n\nYou need to listen via signals to changes in the settings. [Here](https://github.com/domferr/tilingshell/blob/c12f6eecde7279aed0bf5dd8e3631c2551afe068/src/components/windowBorderManager.ts#L415-L417) for example, I listen to changes the user makes to the window border color setting (e.g. from the preferences window).\n```\nthis._signals.connect(Settings, Settings.KEY_WINDOW_BORDER_COLOR, () =>\n            this._border?.updateStyle(),\n);\n```\nIn the code above I listen to changes in the Settings (e.g. changes made from Tiling Shell's preferences window). Specifically, I listen to changes of the key `KEY_WINDOW_BORDER_COLOR`. If it changes then the following function is run \n```\n() =>\n            this._border?.updateStyle(),\n)\n```\n(this is similar to C++ lambda functions!)\nYou can do a similar thing but with something like `KEY_WINDOW_BORDER_COLOR_AUTO`.", "To simplify, I can think of those steps:\n1. Add in Tiling Shell's gschema a new setting with key `window-border-color-auto` which value is a boolean and default value is false\n2. Update class Settings to introduce KEY_WINDOW_BORDER_COLOR_AUTO and getter/setter of WINDOW_BORDER_COLOR_AUTO. This returns/sets a boolean, which defaults to false in case of any error. You can follow other boolean settings in the Settings class\n3. Listen to KEY_WINDOW_BORDER_COLOR_AUTO changes in WindowBorderManager class (like we listen to changes of KEY_WINDOW_BORDER_COLOR)\n4. In WindowBorderManager class, listen to GNOME's `accent-color` changes to update the style of the border (like we listen to changes of KEY_WINDOW_BORDER_COLOR)\n5. Update `src/prefs.ts` file to add a new row in the preferences window to with your new flag `Automatic border color`\n\nReach me out for anything you may need! Feel free to open a pull request whenever you want", "Thanks for all the indications, they are really valuable and I truly appreciate them !\n\nThis doesn't seem too difficult so I think I'll come back in a few days/weeks with a working solution in a PR. \uD83D\uDE04 ", "Hey @vinchatl did you manage to implement this? I'd love to give this update to everybody, let me know if you are working on it so I don't begin the development myself \uD83D\uDE0E ", "I quickly hacked it locally with this function, but I guess it can still help you a bit x)\n```js\nfunction getGnomeAccentColor() {\n    const settings = new Gio.Settings({ schema_id: 'org.gnome.desktop.interface' });\n    const accentColorName = settings.get_string('accent-color');\n    const gnomeAccentColorMapping = {\n      \"blue\": \"#3378cc\",\n      \"teal\": \"#228293\",\n      \"green\": \"#378545\",\n      \"yellow\": \"#b27b06\",\n      \"orange\": \"#d25406\",\n      \"red\": \"#cc2c3f\",\n      \"pink\": \"#bd588b\",\n      \"purple\": \"#833d9b\",\n      \"slate\": \"#667688\"\n    }\n    return gnomeAccentColorMapping[accentColorName]\n}\n````", "It's litteraly my first time seeing a gnome's extension code, and I never contributed to a project but I could try if you don't mind the additional time it could take @domferr\nI don't really know but it seems like it might not be too hard, plus you already described how it could be done", "It ended up being pretty straight forward thanks to your indications x)" ],

I'd say this shouldn't happen since collision shapes are not part of standard visuals but rather serve to let the user know the bounds for the collisions (the collision itself is not clipped, only the collision shape).\nYou can imagine how this makes working with colliders difficult under these conditions :).\n\nDisabled\n<img width=\"1392\" height=\"1265\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f852396-2b0d-420e-9ed7-b941e70eee84\" />\n\nClip Only\n<img width=\"1392\" height=\"1261\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7825b664-02fb-410b-8123-688a2a18775c\" />\n\nClip + Draw\n<img width=\"1392\" height=\"1258\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d888adbb-9ece-4ce5-849e-4fecf0248011\" />\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Add ColorRect.\n2. Give the ColorRect a CollisionShape2D as a child.\n3. Set CircleShape2D as the Shape of the CollisionShape2D.\n4. On the ColorRect go to Visibility section in the Inspector and change Clip Children to Clip Only.\n5. Obsserve the debug shape is now limited only to the ColorRect area.\n\n(This is not ColorRect issue, I used it just as an example, other Control/Node2D nodes which have the Clip Children setting behave the same.)\n\n### Minimal reproduction project (MRP)\n\nN/A. If it's really needed I'll add a simple one but I can't do it right now, I'll be doing it later but it's simple to test if nothing else.",

Initially, verify the email address, which should proceed smoothly. \r\n- Next, attempt to verify the phone number, Despite the successful verification of the email address, the system incorrectly indicates that the user is unverified when verifying the phone number. \r\n- In an attempt to rectify this inconsistency, proceed to unverify the phone number. Unexpectedly, the system now displays an alert indicating that the user is verified, contradicting the initial indication of being unverified.\n\n### \uD83D\uDC4D Expected behavior\n\n- When the user hits **Verify Phone**, the alert should confirm that the `user is verified`.\r\n- When the user hits **Unverify Phone**, the alert should confirm that the `user is unverified`.\n\n### \uD83D\uDC4E Actual Behavior\n\nWhen attempting to **verify the phone numbe**r, an alert incorrectly states that the `user is unverified`. \r\nHowever, when attempting to **unverify the phone**, the system incorrectly indicates that the `user is verified.`\n\n### \uD83C\uDFB2 Appwrite version\n\nVersion 1.4.x\n\n### \uD83D\uDCBB Operating system\n\nWindows\n\n### \uD83E\uDDF1 Your Environment\n\n_No response_\n\n### \uD83D\uDC40 Have you spent some time to check if this issue has been raised before?\n\n- [X] I checked and didn't find similar issue\n\n### \uD83C\uDFE2 Have you read the Code of Conduct?\n\n- [X] I have read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/appwrite/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)",

We then found the condition that was causing the flaw [here](https://github.com/appwrite/console/blob/main/src/routes/(console)/project-%5Bregion%5D-%5Bproject%5D/auth/user-%5Buser%5D/updateStatus.svelte#L49)\n\nWhich was missing a bang.\n\n[stnguyen90](https://github.com/stnguyen90) mentioned the desired behavior:\n\tXYZ's email has been verified\n\tXYZ's email has been unverified\n\tXYZ's phone has been verified\n\tXYZ's phone has been unverified\nNote:\n  The \"s\" should only be there if the name does not end with s. For example, if the user's name was \"Charles\", it should be \"Charles' email has been verified\"\n\nWe implemented a solution that met these requirements by changing this [code](https://github.com/appwrite/console/blob/main/src/routes/(console)/project-%5Bregion%5D-%5Bproject%5D/auth/user-%5Buser%5D/updateStatus.svelte#L48-L50)\n\nTo this code:\n`message: ${$user.name || $user.email || $user.phone || 'The account'}${( $user.name || $user.email || $user.phone || 'The account' ).endsWith('s') ? \"'\" : \"'s\"} email has been ${!$user.emailVerification ? 'unverified' : 'verified'},`\n\nOur team then implemented the same solution to updateVerificationEmail() as well, as seen [here](https://github.com/appwrite/console/pull/2112/files)\n\nThis solution can be tested just as [gurjeetsinghvir](https://github.com/gurjeetsinghvirdee) shows in the video posted to this issue.  Under a project, select Auth. In Auth, select or create a user that has both an email and a phone number. Select the 'Verify account' option and then verify the phone number and email. The correct alerts will be displayed.\n\nHere is out PR: [fix-1392](https://github.com/appwrite/console/pull/2112)\n\nDid we approach this issue correctly?  Shoutouts to my teammate @anthonythang1", "@toukirkhan would love to get an update or status here, thank you :)\n\n@MicahHeneveld , my apologies for the misunderstanding, Toukirkhan already mentioned he's working on it (and sent me a DM about it that his team is also working on it with him to prepare a PR). I just forgot to assign it on time. If Toukirkhan cancels or does not continue, we will review your PR next.\n\nWe also updated the contributor guide to be more clear on the proper steps before putting in a PR for next time, since there were 3 people working on a PR the same time.

I really appreciate you continuing to follow up on this and for all the time you???ve put into helping. As I mentioned earlier in Discord, Toukirkhan had already asked to work on this and confirmed with me directly, (and confusion may have arose from me being late to assigning the issue to him and that there hasn't been any follow ups on progress). I???ve asked him just now (via DM) to post an update on the status here so the thread doesn???t go quiet. (We updated our contributors guide also so this situation doesnt cause conflict again to be more fair to all contributors. \n\nYour PR and feedback have still been helpful for shaping the discussion and clarifying the right approach and that impact is important. thank you!\n\nPS - We have a new idea and we are potentially going to update the contributor guide to also require a weekly checkin for people who are assigned to issues, or it will be reassigned. hopefully this makes a big difference in the whole contribution process :) So, good things are happening!", "@tessamero like I said in the dc, I wanted to see the bug removed. Appriciate that you checked with him and confirming he is still working on it. If he is improving beyond yours expectation then great news for me too." ],

I mean that, for a shared library, the files _need_ to be in a shared/common location -- why would the files for the local library be in that _same_ location?\r\nHowever, I'm sure that for the set of JabRef users, you will probably find a user/situation where file copying would not be desirable. \uD83D\uDE05 \r\n\r\nOne could ask the user on drop/paste for the desired behaviour.\r\nLet's say we drag/drop (or copy/paste) one or more entries from library A to library B:\r\n1.

Check if the file can be accessed from library **A** (according to its user/general/... directory settings) with the defined file path. \r\n    * If not, this indicates a pre-existing problem, abort and report.\r\n3. Check if the file can be accessed from library **B** (according to its user/general/... directory settings) with the defined file path. \r\n    * If yes, both libraries store to the same location, and we're done.\r\n    * If not, the file entry would be broken after copying, so we have to do something:\r\n    * Ask the user if they want to copy the file copied (default?), move the file (if desired?), or the path in the entry deleted.\r\n      *  If copy, copy the file to the destination in **B** according to the \"Download fulltext\" functionality.\r\n      *  If we allow moving, delete it in the source entry to not break _that_ entry.

We however have not been able to set it to be the default state and were looking for some help. The textfield we added is to store the shared library's directory path so we can properly copy the linked file to the right place. Our changes so far can be seen in the draft PR [https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/12854](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/12854).

JabRef has the infrastructure to check it, but it needs to be wired together.\n\nA whole bib file should be checked.\n\nThere is a Python-script \"RefChecker\" doing it, but we want to do it integrated in JabRef\n\n## Related Work\n\nSee https://github.com/markrussinovich/refchecker\n\n(LinkedIn-Post: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/markrussinovich_github-markrussinovichrefchecker-a-tool-activity-7355654490076696576-WycH?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAACCUVQBYmlu_A9exTiDRiuXB95v-LNYD4c)\n\n\n## 1. Implement logic\n\n2. If not DOI exists: DOIs are determined for entry; If not successful: Search on arXIv. If not successful, search at configured sources for paper - if not found - mark it.\n3. If DOI exists: check if dermined DOI is equal\n4. Check if entry from DOI differs from data - be a bit relaxed\n  - For comparison: convert author names into \"normal form\"\n  - Ignore case errors at title\n5. Output discrepancies\n\nFor 5: This is somewhot similar to org.jabref.logic.quality.consistency.BibliographyConsistencyCheck, but the latter is on a syntactical thing.\n\n## 2. Add test\n\nFor 1, tests need to be crafted. Think of TDD - and add tests before/while coding\n\n## 3. Wire into CLI\n\n\nA. Include `refcheck `--online`/`--offline` <file.bib>` in  `org.jabref.cli.ArgumentProcessor`\nB. Include `refcheck `--online`/`--offline` <file.pdf>` in  `org.jabref.cli.ArgumentProcessor`\n\nFor B\n\nImport references from PDF into .bib using \"New library based on references\".

      "description" : "## Guideline\n1. Carefully read the issue description before applying to ensure you have all the necessary information to start working on it.\n2. Write a brief description of how you will approach the task (without using ChatGPT).\n3. Add your Telegram handler in your application (e.g., in OnlyDust or similar)\n4. Write ETA in your application\n\n\n\n## What should I do if I have a problem\n1. Try to google it before asking. Googling is taking major part of dev work \n2. If you couldn't find answer your question with Google, text your question to [dev](https://t.me/spotnet_dev/4) group with your question.\n3. Do not send DM to maintainer, it would be better and faster to ask other contributors in chat \n\n\n## How to prepare PR\n1. Check if your code [smell](https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/smells) good\n2. Add `close #<issue number>` to link your issue with your PR\n3. Do not commit changes that are unrelated to your task\n4. Check after you created PR, if you committed everything\n\n\n## Task Description\n1. In the [handlers folder](./blob/main/margin/margin_app/app/telegram/handlers), create a new file named `admin.py`. Inside, add a handler called `/assets`. Use the [`Admin Filter` from this issue](https://github.com/djeck1432/spotnet/issues/915) to verify the user is an admin. Then, call the [`Assets statistic` method from this issue](https://github.com/djeck1432/spotnet/issues/906) to retrieve the data. Format the response using Telegram Markdown so it displays neatly.\n2. Provide a screenshot demonstrating that the handler works as expected.\n",

      "description" : "### \uD83D\uDC1B Describe the bug\n\n`torch.fx.Tracer` has a `record_stack_traces` member. It does not give the correct stack trace, starting with torch  2.4 RC.\r\n\r\nI am not sure it is part of the external API, but it was nice to have. The following is working in 2.3, but broken in 2.4RC\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport torch.fx\r\nclass M1(torch.nn.Module):\r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n        super().__init__()\r\n        self.linear = torch.nn.Linear(1, 1)\r\n    def forward(self, x):\r\n        return x + self.linear(x)\r\nclass M2(torch.nn.Module):\r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n        super().__init__()\r\n        self.m1 = M1()\r\n    def forward(self, x):\r\n        return x + self.m1(x)\r\nm = M2()\r\ntracer = torch.fx.Tracer()\r\ntracer.record_stack_traces=True\r\ngraph = tracer.trace(m)\r\nsym=torch.fx.GraphModule(m,graph)\r\nprint(sym.print_readable())\r\nassert 'code: return x + self.linear(x)' in sym.print_readable()\r\nassert 'code: return x + self.m1(x)' in sym.print_readable()\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt was broken in this PR: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/121449/ where you stopped using the find_user_frame (or an equivalent function) to filter non user stack traces.\r\n\r\nSomething along these lines can be probably used as a fix:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    def create_proxy(self, kind, target,args, kwargs, name, type_expr = None, proxy_factory_fn = None):\r\n....\r\n     if self.record_stack_traces and not proxy.node.stack_trace:\r\n            proxy.node.stack_trace = _find_user_frame2_4(''.join(CapturedTraceback.extract().format()))\r\n\r\n\r\n    def _find_user_frame2_4(self, stack_trace):\r\n        stack_trace=stack_trace.split('\\n')\r\n        if 'torch/fx/proxy.py' in stack_trace[-3]:\r\n            stack_trace=stack_trace[:-1]\r\n            while len(stack_trace)>2 and '/fx/' in stack_trace[-2]:\r\n                stack_trace=stack_trace[:-2]\r\n        return '\\n'.join(stack_trace)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- I am not sure why you don't see the effect in `torch.export.export`.\r\n- `torch.export.unflatten` looses stack trace for collapsed modules.\n\n### Versions\n\nPyTorch version: 2.4.0+cu121\r\nIs debug build: False\r\nCUDA used to build PyTorch: 12.1\r\nROCM used to build PyTorch: N/A\r\n\r\nOS:

      "description" : "### Overview\n\nWhat is the problem we're solving? For very simple items, this can be encapsulated in the success criteria.\n\nPuerto Rico data is incorporated into EIA spreadsheets in separate tabs that mirror the ones that we already process in PUDL. In #4312, we brought the Puerto Rico data for EIA 923 into raw assets. EIA 860M also has Puerto Rico data in separate tabs, starting in `eia860m-2018-03.xlsx`. This is an important first step to bringing in Puerto Rico data for EIA 860M into PUDL.\n\n### Success Criteria\n\nHow will we know that we're done?\n\n* [ ] raw_eia860m__puerto_rico_generator_existing is extracted into a dataframe\n* [ ] raw_eia860m__puerto_rico_generator_proposed is extracted into a dataframe\n* [ ] raw_eia860m__puerto_rico_generator_retired is extracted into a dataframe\n\n### Get set up\n\n- [ ] Fork the PUDL repository and follow the steps to set up the [PUDL development environment](https://catalystcoop-pudl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/dev_setup.html)\n- [ ] Activate the pudl-dev environment: mamba activate pudl-dev\n- [ ] Grab the latest raw data for any relevant tables - in this case, EIA 860. To do so, run pudl_datastore --dataset eia860\n\n### Next steps\n\nFollowing the instructions in our [development documentation](https://catalystcoop-pudl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/existing_data_updates.html#map-the-structure-of-the-new-data) for adding new data, update the:\n* [ ] `eia860m/file_map.csv`\n* [ ] `eia860m/page_map.csv`\n* [ ] `eia860m/skip_rows.csv`\n* [ ] `eia860m/skip_footer.csv`\n* [ ] create a spreadsheet in the `eia860m/column_maps` folder for each new tab: `puerto_rico_generator_existing`, `puerto_rico_generator_proposed` and `puerto_rico_generator_retired`. These _should_ be identical to the corresponding EIA 860M pages that are already mapped, with the exception of the data only starting in 2018-03.\n* [ ] Generate the `raw_eia860m` assets, and debug as needed.\n",

      "description" : "# Missing Azure MCP Server (Dataplane) Tools\n\nThe following 100+ tools should be created following the established naming convention `azmcp-<namespace>-<service>-<operation>`.   Each checkbox below contains enough details to add each tool using `VS Code CoPilot in Agent mode`:\n\n```bash\n`mcp tool name` - `mcp tool description` - Suggested prompt: `test prompt`\n```\n\nThe 68 tools shipped in [v0.3.1](https://github.com/Azure/azure-mcp/releases) have already been excluded from the to-do list.\n\n# Instructions\n1. Before starting on a tool please quickly double check for open issues and/or PRs that match the service name to avoid accidental duplicate work. \n2. Next, claim a tool from the list.  Click the `...` and select `Convert to sub-issue`.  This will remove the tool from this mega-issue and create a new sub-issue.  It'll be referenced from the very bottom of this issue conversation if you scroll down.\n3. Edit the newly created sub-issue.\n    - First, copy the issue title (`tool name`, `tool description`, `test prompt`) into the issue body and format the text.\n    - Then, shorten the title to something manageable, like just the `tool name`.\n    - Next, set the issue labels `onboarding` and the `area-` (ex: `area-storage`, `area-keyvault`, etc)    \n    - \uD83D\uDC49 Finally, assign the issue to yourself so others know who is working on it\n 4. Follow the instructions in the `CONTRIBUTING.md`.  \n     - ??????

Also double-check that an existing [ONBOARDING] issue does not already exist or is in progress before you begin work on a tool in this list.", "@joshfree @xiangyan99 In regard to the storage data movement tools, could you provide the rationale on why a separate namespace for dmlib is being planned? Would it make sense to just leverage dmlib in the main transfer entry points in each service (e.g., `azmcp-storage-files-shares-file-upload`, `azmcp-storage-blob-download`, etc.) and remove the dmlib namespace altogether? The main reasons I ask this is:\n\n* Unless the consumer of the MCP server is familiar with the Azure .NET Storage SDK, the dmlib related-tools may be difficult to know about/discover in case they are being selective on which MCP tools they allow.\n* It seems like in order to drop into a dmlib tool, it requires a prompt involving  \"optimal performance\" or involves a feature of dmlib (e.g., resumeable transfers). That being said, I'd assume that customers would want optimal performance without requiring to prompt for it in which case the default/main entry point would just leverage dmlib to get the best performance.\n\nI'm also happy to move this conversation to a new GitHub issue specific to keep this main dataplane tracking issue's conversation clean.

See the guidance below for implementing organization in the list.\n\n<img width=\"1996\" height=\"758\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b8de915-a3ad-415b-a564-22391ca644ce\" />\n<img width=\"1996\" height=\"646\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/205dc8bd-327c-4730-97b8-c744df1ab18b\" />\n<br/><br/>\n\n* The organizations which has ???deleted??? status should be listed as well, however, those organizations should be at the bottom of the list. \n* When the user is clicking to view the organization details, the user should be redirected to an empty organization detail page.\n* When the user is deleting an organization, the user should be [prompted for confirmation](http://localhost:6006/?path=/docs/ui-alertdialog--docs#delete-confirmation), then the organization should be deleted -- see the Organization Service and API for more details.\n\n_End-to-end tests are not strictly necessary, but highly welcomed as a bonus._\n\n### Example Use-cases\n\n- A user would like to check what organizations are available.\n- A user would like to check the details of an organization (if has permission)\n- A user would like to check the list of deleted organizations\n\n### Drawbacks\n\nDue to the lack of design, there is a high chance that adjustments will be needed later or in context of the PR.",

Because it seems to miss the context of what the Pressbooks imports are, and how the `source_records` field is supposed to be used.\n\nHere are some more Pressbook records that have all been imported by https://openlibrary.org/people/ImportBot:\n\n/books/OL37936309M\n/books/OL37936356M\n/books/OL37937049M\n/books/OL37937550M\n/books/OL37937876M\n/books/OL37936954M\n/books/OL37937596M\n/books/OL37937598M\n/books/OL37937784M\n/books/OL37938013M\n\nIf you look at the existing code you can see that the source record prefix is intended to be a limited and controlled set of import sources that checks for a prefix `ia:`, `amazon:`,  `bwb:` etc, and forms a safe URL using a stored bibliographic identifier.\n\nThese records appears to have been imported with arbitrary full URLs and an unrecognised new prefix `pressbooks:`\n\nThis doesn't really fit with how the `source_records` field is currently used, or the UI to display it. \n\nThe OL records already have a `providers` field with the same URL which points to an online book, which seems to be the point, eg for https://openlibrary.org/books/OL37938013M.yml \n\n```\nproviders:\n-   provider: pressbooks\n    url: https://openwa.pressbooks.pub/youthnarrativesofillness/\n```\n\nRepeating the actual book URL in a field intended for bibliographic metadata sources seems unnecessary and wrong.\n\nI think the fix here is to prevent ImportBot from incorrectly populating `source_records` for arbitrary imports and remove them from ones already imported. I don't know the background to Pressbooks importing, so maybe there is something else to consider?", "Yeah we have a bit of overlap between three separate but highly overlapping concepts: `identifiers`, `source_records`, and `providers`. We'll have to untangle them at some point, but I work with them as follows:\n\n- `identifiers` provide links to equivalent edition, work, author, language, or other records in other catalogues/data repos.\n    - Note for legacy reasons this is `remote_ids` on authors.\n- `source_records` provide a record of where/how data was imported. Similar to wikidata references. In the form `<source_name/type/kind>:<source_identifier>`\n    - This already establishes some overlap between this concept and identifiers, and in fact we do often see that `source_records` will have corresponding fields in `identifiers`.\n    - Should ideally provide enough info to \"redo\" the import\n- `providers` provides links to places on the web that provide the full text itself in some way. Similar to/inspired by OPDS acquisitions.\n    - Note under the hood, when we specify identifiers for LibriVox, Standard Ebooks, WikiSource, etc. (Trusted Book Providers), that sort of results in a dynamically created `provider` record.\n\nIn this model that I'm using, `pressbooks:<url>` seems reasonable to me. Same as `marc:<marc_subpath>` seems reasonable. These both communicate the same thing (1) data was imported into this record, (2) the importer ran using the `pressbooks`, `marc` importer logic, and (3) the input to the logic can be found at `<url>` or `<march_subpath>`. Both give enough info to \"recreate\" the import.", "@cdrini   I can't see a MARC record at the URL https://fscj.pressbooks.pub/americangovernment/  -- MARC records are a standard bibliographic metadata format which are recognised outside OpenLibrary, and are displayed with raw link at the https://openlibrary.org/show-records/ path when you click on the `record` link.\n\nCurrently all links to imported MARC records are copied and hosted on archive.org, which is effectively OpenLibrary's MARC storage. Individual MARCs are on scanned items, metadata only bulk MARCs are aggregated on items without scans. \n\nhttps://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/blob/31c1ce3eb811598065bf6455a69f3050cf322c8f/scripts/import_pressbooks.py suggests the import source is a JSON file, and the relationship between that JSON and the URL isn't clear.\n\nPerhaps it's a bit more like an `amazon:` record, where there's a recognised API to request the metadata from the source?, but it still looks to me like the linked ebook is actually the source of its own metadata, so the `source_record` isn't really a distinct bibliographic record.\n\nMy main point was that the `source_records` prefix is controlled, so to work ,`pressbooks:` needs to be recognised in https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/blob/master/openlibrary/templates/history/sources.html\n\n`openalex:` was added semi-recently: https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/commit/980a2bc7113e23b61608f5c580d1c0730194f71f  This seems like the same sort of thing.\n\n Here's an example of an OpenAlex sourced book: https://openlibrary.org/books/OL51658775M/Eusebius_Onomasticon    The source_records do something sensible there, and link to something that looks like a bib record.\n\nSome `source_records:` show something on the https://openlibrary.org/show-records/ path , OpenAlex links directly. What behaviour would be appropriate for Pressbooks?\n\nThe metadata link, such as it is, appears to be: https://fscj.pressbooks.pub/americangovernment/#block-metadata-title\n" ],

The other choice is to not allow ANY changes to a closed account, but that is probably overkill and would take more work. Probably what should happen is that adding transactions to a closed account should be blocked. So the add transaction button should be removed for closed accounts and also block any rule that is attempting to move a transaction to a closed account. A transaction could still be changed to cause the problem. Locking the account completely is probably the correct fix. Then, if someone wants to make any change, they have to unclose the account and closing it again will force the balance to zero.",

While it generally describes the situation and returns the correct 409 response, it's not the best fit since it's an Iceberg-specific exception. In some of these cases, the conflict actually originates from Polaris.\n\nWe should review where `CommitFailedException` is used and consider replacing it with a more appropriate and specific `CommitConflictException` when the conflict comes from Polaris.", "Yes, `CommitFailedException` is currently used by Polaris code to represent eventual 409 errors in the REST API. However, Polaris uses a lot of non-REST Iceberg code and `CommitFailedException` may potentially occur in other contexts, where it is not clear what the appropriate REST status code should be.\n\nIMHO, it is preferable to use `CommitConflictException`, which is owned by Polaris and is intended to clearly map to 409 at the REST level." ],

But maybe pydantic has some better approach?\n\nrelated:\n```\n???                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ???\n??? ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? locals ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????                                                                      ???\n??? ??? data = {                                                                                                                                             ???                                                                      ???\n??? ???        ???

Synchronizing dependencies between the two repos has the added benefit of preventing unwanted regressions where an issue might be fixed in Bifold but break in BC Wallet, or vice versa. It's a small amount of work for a lot of gain\n\n### Developer notes\nDeps should be aligned between the two repos so that the whichever dep is newer in either is used in both, preferably updating to the latest patch version as well. ie: if one repo has `my-dep@3.4.1` and the other has `my-dep@4.0.0` then upgrade both to `my-dep@4.0.7` (assuming 4.0.7 is the latest patch version)",

ESC is easy to generate in the terminal accidentally with different intentions than canceling the current task.  One example: `screen` uses it to enter \"copy mode\" and it is easy to mis-time the keyboard sequence and accidentally send an escape through to Gemini. Or, if you are used to https://stackoverflow.com/a/5542996 or are a vim user, ESC is never as destructive as canceling an ongoing operation.\n\n\n\n### Why is this needed?\n\nI have accidentally sent an escape into the terminal a few times, canceling an ongoing Gemini call.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

Add a staff text\r\n2. Set the Frame to rectangle in Properties\r\n3. Click the color swatch to set the flll color\r\n4. See error: no opacity control\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nAn opacity control is needed to create translucent effects, such as mimicking a yellow highlighter pen\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nThis is how it looked in MuseScore 3, and shows how the feature was commonly used by educators:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1799936/194440528-9a4a0ebb-dc2a-4e42-a88e-3b197a0bb46e.png)\r\n\r\n**Platform information**\r\n - OS: Linux\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nIn MU3, it was very annoyingly necessary to explicitly set this to 255 if you wanted to actually see the background color at all - the default was 0.  Glad to see that opening this dialog now sets the color to opaque.  But, there still needs to be a way to set it to intermediate values like 127.  And, a small complication - that value, once explicitly set, should remain set and not get arbitrarily changed to 255 every time you open the dialog.  So, whatever magic happens to force the opacity to 255 upon setting a color, should be smart enough not to do this if there is an explicit opacity value already set.\r\n",

If a user really needs to sample a lot of elements that allow duplicates, he can achieve the same purpose by calling the command multiple times.\r\n\r\n",

Write a brief description of how you will approach the task (without using ChatGPT).\n3. Add your Telegram handler in your application (e.g., in OnlyDust or similar)\n4. Write ETA in your application\n\n\n\n## What should I do if I have a problem\n1. Try to google it before asking. Googling is taking major part of dev work \n2. If you couldn't find answer your question with Google, text your question to [dev](https://t.me/spotnet_dev/4) group with your question.\n3. Do not send DM to maintainer, it would be better and faster to ask other contributors in chat \n\n\n## How to prepare PR\n1. Check if your code [smell](https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/smells) good\n2. Add `close #<issue number>` to link your issue with your PR\n3. Do not commit changes that are unrelated to your task\n4. Check after you created PR, if you committed everything\n\n\n## Task Description\n1. **Update Endpoint Behavior**  \n   Refactor the `/admin/me` endpoint to return the currently authenticated admin's data.  \n   It should:\n   - Rely on the authentication token to identify the admin\n   - Return relevant admin fields (e.g. `id`, `email`, `is_super_admin`)\n   - Exclude sensitive data such as password hashes\n\n2. **Ensure Secure Access**  \n   Make sure the route is protected and only accessible to authenticated admin users.\n\n3. **Update Response Schema**  \n   Use a clear and secure response model to structure the output.\n\n4. **Write Tests**  \n   Add tests for:\n   - Authenticated access\n   - Unauthorized access\n   - Correct data structure\n\n5. **Verify CI Workflow**  \n   Ensure all tests pass and the workflow remains green.",

      "comments" : [ "Hi @joshmedeski \n\nFirst off; thanks for providing sesh! It's been a great time saver within my workflow for some time now.\n\nI'm planning on submitting a PR for this exact feature, but I'd want to discuss a few things:\n- Should the \"namer\" only apply to i.E. zoxide items or all items? In my eyes, zoxide would benefit the most from this setting as I wouldn't want to accidentally rename any tmux or config defined sessions. Based on the decision I'd name the config field either `path_substitution` (if zoxide only) or `name_substitution` instead of `namer` (all)\n- I'd support regular expressions out of the box by trying to create a regexp based on \"find\", if it fails I'd fall back to literal substitution.\n- I'd add opt-in support for expanding env variables with `expand_env_vars = true` for portable configs (which could be useful for eg. `find = \"$HOME/.local/share/git`)\n- I'd add a `priority` field to control which substitution takes precedence (default `0`)\n\nLet me know what you thought about the feature or if you have any other recommendations/ideas \uD83D\uDE01 \n", "Hey @janbiasi! \n\nThanks for the detailed proposal and for wanting to contribute this feature! Here are my thoughts on your questions:\n\n- **Config naming**: I agree with `name_substitution` over `namer` - it's clearer about what we're doing (changing session names). I'd also prefer this to apply to **all session sources** (zoxide, config-defined) rather than just zoxide. Note that existing tmux sessions wouldn't be impacted since they already exist - this would only affect how new sessions are named when created. Let's start simple with this global application and we can add source-specific controls later if users need that level of granularity.\n\n- **Regex support**: Sounds good! Actually, we already have a substitution library in the project - check out the `replacer` package. It might be worth leveraging what's already there rather than building from scratch.\n\n- **Environment variables**: I like the idea, but let's keep the first version simpler and get a solid proof of concept working first. We can add env var expansion in a follow-up.\n\n- **Priority field**: Same thinking - let's start simple. For v1, we could just match on the first rule that applies. If multiple rules can be applied without conflicting, that's fine, but let's not overcomplicate the initial implementation.\n\nMy preference is to start with a minimal viable version that covers the core use case, then iterate based on user feedback. Does this direction align with what you were thinking?\n\nLooking forward to the PR! \uD83D\uDE80\n" ],

      "description" : "## Guideline\n1. Carefully read the issue description before applying to ensure you have all the necessary information to start working on it.\n2. Write a brief description of how you will approach the task (without using ChatGPT).\n3. Add your Telegram handler in your application (e.g., in OnlyDust or similar)\n4. Write ETA in your application\n\n\n\n## What should I do if I have a problem\n1. Try to google it before asking. Googling is taking major part of dev work \n2. If you couldn't find answer your question with Google, text your question to [dev](https://t.me/spotnet_dev/4) group with your question.\n3. Do not send DM to maintainer, it would be better and faster to ask other contributors in chat \n\n\n## How to prepare PR\n1. Check if your code [smell](https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/smells) good\n2.  Add `close #<issue number>` to link your issue with your PR\n3.  Do not commit changes which is not related to your task \n4. Check after you created PR, if you committed everything.\n\n\n## Task Description\n1. Implement CRUD methods to retrieve the data shown in the following diagram:\n\n   ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb26457a-78c3-4f47-bdc6-876f4b917848)\n\nIt will be calculated by summing the token amounts across all `user_pools` and multiplying them by their current prices, as defined in [this issue](https://github.com/djeck1432/spotnet/issues/909).\n\n2. Add a new endpoint `/admin/statistic/assets` in the [`admin.py`](https://github.com/djeck1432/spotnet/blob/main/margin/margin_app/app/api/admin.py) file to expose this data.\n3. Write tests for the new endpoint, covering both positive and negative scenarios.\n4. Verify that all CI workflows pass and the endpoint functions correctly.\n",

      "description" : "## \uD83D\uDCDB Bug Description\n\nWhen using the navbar, everything functions correctly initially. However, there???s an issue related to scroll behavior. Suppose there are five items in the navbar: **Dashboard**, **Learning Hub**, **Study Buddy**, **Tech Feed**, **Resume Builder**, and **Placement Prep**.\n\n- If I am on the **Dashboard** and I haven't scrolled at all, then navigating to any other item works perfectly.\n- BUT if I **scroll down a bit on the Dashboard**, and then **navigate to another navbar item**, that new item **also opens with the same scrolled position**. It doesn't load from the top.\n\nThis causes a poor user experience and inconsistent navigation between pages.\n\n---\n\n## \uD83D\uDCCD Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Go to the homepage (**Dashboard**).\n2. Scroll down a little (just a bit).\n3. Now click on any other item in the navbar (e.g., **Learning Hub** or **Resume Builder**).\n4. Notice that the new page is **already scrolled down**, instead of starting at the top.\n\n---\n\n## \uD83E\uDD14 Expected Behavior\n\nWhen navigating between navbar items or pages:\n- The page should always load from the top (`window.scrollTo(0, 0)`).\n- Scroll position from the previous page should **not** be retained.\n\n---\n\n## \uD83D\uDCBB Environment\n\n- **OS**: Windows 10  \n- **Browser**: Chrome 117.0.5938.62  \n- **GitHub Username**: @Aishwarya-1202  \n- **Program**: GSSoC'25 Contributor  \n\n---\n\n## \uD83C\uDFAF Screenshots / Videos \n\n*If required, I have shared a short screen recording showing the bug.*\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3156b95f-509a-49ab-83d1-8944972581e4 ",

Thanks for showing interest in improving TalkHeal, looking forward to your response!", "Hi @eccentriccoder01,\n\nThanks for getting back to me! I'm happy to clarify my plan.\n\nMy proposal focuses on making the sidebar more intuitive by grouping related items. Here's a quick breakdown of the changes I have in mind:\n\nGroup Urgent Help: I plan to place the \"Emergency Help\" button and the \"Crisis Support\" link together at the very top. This makes critical support instantly visible and accessible.\n\nCreate Clear Sections: To tidy up the list, I'll group \"Mental Health Check\" and \"Resources & Knowledge Base\" under a \"Tools\" section, and move \"About TalkHeal\" to the bottom, which is a more standard placement.\n\nTo answer your final question, these changes are purely layout and styling. My goal is to improve the existing user experience and visual consistency without altering any core functionality.\n\nI believe these adjustments will make the sidebar feel cleaner and more organized for users", "Thanks for the clarification, @KadimiJaswanth !\nYour plan to improve the sidebar's structure and flow sounds great.

After serializing `SystemTime` into the `EX1` u32 expiration parameter, and deserializing back into the type that precision is lost and an `assert_eq` failed, raising this issue, since we are storing time as `SystemTime` in many parts of the `payjoin` crate.\n\nIt seems to me that encoding this information internally as precise as the URL-serialized representation would be more accurate. For this purpose we may even use [`bitcoin::absolute::Time`](https://docs.rs/bitcoin/latest/bitcoin/absolute/struct.Time.html). Other than accuracy, changing to a u32 UnixTime abstraction gives us the advantage that u32 would work in `wasm` where `SystemTime` is not available.\n\nI think this may be a good first issue to start, but it might be tricky to get the ergonomics right to completely close this issue. We'd need to figure out what type (`u64`, `u32`, or `bitcoin::absolute::Time`?) to expose in the API arguments and across the FFI boundary even if the internal representation becomes `absolute::Time`. We may take a look at how conversion ergonomics from `SystemTime::now()` to `bitcoin::absolute::Time` (or similar functionality) are designed as inspiration.\n\n",

The structured data (structs, enums, errors, etc.) relying on `std::time::SystemTime` need to rely on `u64`, `u32`, or `bitcoin::absolute::Time` instead, since only the latter encodes the second (rather than nanosecond) precision with which the protocol is concerned. I suggest studying the difference between the types, making a suggestion, and writing up rationale for whatever decision you find most appropriate or otherwise asking specific questions about the differences between them. `bitcoin::absolute::Time` came up because it's already a dependency and makes it explicit we're talking about a concrete unix time as a seconds-precision unsigned integer under the hood, but you could argue for u64 or u32 as well.\n\nWorking around `SystemTime::now()` calls is outside of the scope of this issue. That call does have side-effects that should be eventually worked around by making the state machine methods that currently call `SystemTime::now()` take `now` in seconds as input (in the type you choose) instead. This can be done as a follow up or separate concern." ],

The specific steps are shown in the following figure:\nError flow in the same conversation:\n\n<img width=\"465\" height=\"662\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f2f73f1-4a85-472c-a987-ab015554306d\" />\n\n<img width=\"482\" height=\"567\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f349db39-f305-4f62-83b7-d61af239d6e3\" />\n\nThe correct process in the same conversation:\n\n<img width=\"475\" height=\"614\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/397384f5-ad75-4a47-9267-d9a2d3cf8cdb\" />\n\n<img width=\"478\" height=\"457\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51993cce-0975-4913-947e-aa89434cbe96\" />\n\nNode details???\n\n<img width=\"1741\" height=\"687\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/821a7820-d87d-4521-822b-210bb9e5bdae\" />\n\nI think the possible causes of this problem???\nBecause the question classifier node has a specific format for parsing, such as JSON format or others, when answering questions through the built-in prompt words of dify, it does not actually return in the required format of the prompt words\n1. It might be that the LLM large model lacks sufficient intelligence (this has been tested. deepseek-chat issues always occur, gpt-4o occasionally shows up, and gpt-4.1 basically never appears).\n2. The content of the online text is too much, confusing the LLM's understanding of the prompt words\nThe above is only for my own reference after testing\n\n### ?????? Expected Behavior\n\nAn error should not occur\n\n### ??? Actual Behavior\n\nAn error occurred",

      "comments" : [ "<!-- Answer -->\nThe error `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'content'` happens when the LLM response is missing or malformed???often because the model didn't return output in the expected JSON format. This is more common with models like deepseek-chat, less so with gpt-4o, and rarely with gpt-4.1, likely due to differences in how reliably each model follows prompt instructions.\n\nThe code for the problem classifier node (QuestionClassifierNode) expects a valid response and does not always check if the LLM's reply is None before trying to access its content, which can trigger this error if the model fails to return a proper result. This risk increases if the prompt is complex or the input is large, making it harder for the LLM to follow the required format. The codebase has some error handling for invalid JSON, but not for missing responses, so an explicit check for None before accessing `.content` would make this more robust [(source)](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/blob/7bf3d2c8bf5715305e1615fb4a5ba02c42d03643/api/core/workflow/nodes/question_classifier/question_classifier_node.py).\n\nTo reduce these errors: use models known to follow instructions well (like gpt-4.1), keep prompts and context concise, and consider adding a None check in the code before accessing `.content` to prevent unhandled exceptions. Prompt engineering???making the output format requirement very explicit and simple???can also help.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

I intend to do this, and here is my plan.\n\n### Implementation Plan for Nightly Tests Using Latest npm Package Versions\n\n**Objective:**  \nUpdate all nightly test workflows to install and test against the latest published versions of npm packages, rather than only those pinned in `package.json`.\n\n---\n\n#### 1. Identify All Nightly Workflows\n\n- Locate every GitHub Actions workflow that runs on a scheduled basis (i.e., includes a `schedule:` trigger).\n\n#### 2. Find JS Dependency Installation Steps\n\n- In each workflow, identify steps that install JavaScript dependencies (typically using `yarn install` or `npm install`).\n\n#### 3. Add Dependency Upgrade Step for Nightly Runs\n\n- Before the dependency installation step, add steps to upgrade all dependencies in `package.json` to their latest versions.\n- Use [`npm-check-updates`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates) (`ncu`) for this purpose.\n- Ensure these steps only run for scheduled (nightly) workflows using `if: github.event_name == 'schedule'`.\n\n#### 4. Apply Changes to All Relevant Subprojects\n\n- Repeat this process for every subdirectory in the repository that uses npm/yarn (e.g., `solidity-example/js`, `recursion/js`, `web-starter/web/vite`, `web-starter/web/webpack`, `web-starter/web/nextjs`, etc.).\n\n#### 5. Verify and Monitor\n\n- After implementing the changes, verify that nightly runs use the latest versions of npm dependencies by inspecting workflow logs and generated lockfiles.\n- Ensure that tests complete and that any failures are properly reported via the issue creation step.\n\n#### 6. Document the Change\n\n- Add comments to the workflow files or repository documentation to clarify that nightly runs use the latest npm package versions.\n\n\n**Outcome:**  \nNightly test runs will always use the newest versions of npm dependencies, helping to proactively catch breaking changes or incompatibilities introduced by upstream updates.\n" ],

I'm [Dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot) and I???m helping the dify team.\n\n<!-- Answer -->\nThis error is likely caused by missing null/undefined checks in the frontend code for the Question Classifier node panel. When you click the node during execution, the required state or data may not be available yet, leading to a crash if the component tries to access properties of a null object. This pattern has been seen in other Dify issues and is often resolved by adding robust null guards and error handling in the relevant React components to prevent the UI from crashing if data is missing or in transition ([example](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/16142), [example](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/16173)).\n\nRecent pull requests have improved variable validation and error handling for workflow nodes, but there???s no direct evidence this specific bug is fixed in 1.7.0. Upgrading to the latest version may help, as changes like [#21766](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/21766), [#21932](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/21932), and [#22462](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/22462) have touched related areas. If upgrading isn???t possible, a workaround is to add null checks in the Question Classifier node???s panel/component rendering logic (see `web/app/components/workflow/nodes/_base/components/workflow-panel/index.tsx`) to ensure the UI doesn???t try to access properties of a null object during rapid state changes.\n\nIf you have custom modifications, double-check that all node data is initialized before rendering, and consider adding fallback UI or error messages when required data is missing ([reference](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/20725)).\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

can click during execution without errors\n- ??? **v1.6.0 and later** (including v1.7.0): Frontend crashes with \"Cannot read properties of null (reading 'props')\" when clicking Question Classifier node during workflow execution\n\n### Testing Method:\n1.

The question is two-fold:\n- Why is the VST3 const so specific not to be in an insert?\n- Do we loose anything by changing that mapping (like: it is not being listed anymore in a analyzer category)?\n", "To me it looks to me like it's mapped to `kAnalyzer`, not `kFxAnalyzer`.

In my plug-in, if I mark it as an analyzer like so:\n\n```c++\nstatic constexpr const char * features[] = {\n    CLAP_PLUGIN_FEATURE_ANALYZER,\n    CLAP_PLUGIN_FEATURE_STEREO,\n    nullptr,\n}\n```\n\nBitwig shows \"Analysis\" for the category for the VST3 and CLAP versions, but Audacity doesn't allow it to be inserted and the VST3PluginTestHost shows \"Analyzer\" for the SubCat, but also no longer allows me to insert it into its effects list.\n\nIf I mark it like so:\n```c++\nstatic constexpr const char * features[] = {\n    CLAP_PLUGIN_FEATURE_ANALYZER,\n    CLAP_PLUGIN_FEATURE_AUDIO_EFFECT, // swapping this with the line above has no affect to the behavior\n    CLAP_PLUGIN_FEATURE_STEREO,\n    nullptr,\n}\n```\n\nBitwig shows \"Audio FX\" for the category on both VST3 and CLAP versions. The resulting SubCat is \"Analyzer|Fx\" (regardless of order). I only just now noticed that it does insert both the category and subcategory but in the wrong order. However, if that behavior was fixed the CLAP plug-in would still not show the Analyzer category.", "Hm, we will try to figure this out. In the meantime you can also implement CLAP_PLUGIN_FACTORY_INFO_VST3 where you can override all VST3 options, also the feature string.\n", "ok, the VST3 SDK lists:\n```c++\nSMTG_CONSTEXPR const CString kFxAnalyzer\t\t\t= \"Fx|Analyzer\";\t///< Scope, FFT-Display, Loudness Processing...\n//...\nSMTG_CONSTEXPR const CString kAnalyzer\t\t\t    = \"Analyzer\";\t    ///< Meter, Scope, FFT-Display, not selectable as insert plug-in\n```\n\nSo essentially, if `Fx` is missing, it shouldn't be in an insert - why ever this should be desirable.\nIn this case, I think we should map it to kFxAnalyzer. The function `clapCategoriesToVST3` must be adapted a bit since it does not support the `|`inside, it also does not sort `Fx` before `Analyzer` . It just sorts them alphabetically - which should be okay according to the VST3 SDK, but hosts.. *sigh* \n\nSo, yes, this needs a bit of tweaking.\n", "> Hm, we will try to figure this out.

      "repositoryName" : "huggingface/transformers",
      "description" : "## Community contributions: Add Fast Image Processors\n\nFast image processors have been rolling out progressively for a while. Now that the [BaseImageProcessorFast](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/image_processing_utils_fast.py#L292), from which all fast image processors inherit, is in a more stable state, I'm opening this issue to encourage contributors to add fast image processors for models that still only have a \"slow\" image processor.\n\n### How to implement a Fast Image Processor\n\nThe core principle of fast image processors is to use `torch` and `torchvision` functions for image transformations instead of `PIL` or `numpy`. Among other performance benefits, this enables processing images on GPU, significantly improving inference speed.\n\nAnother key difference compared to slow image processors is that, unlike `BaseImageProcessor`, which provides only a minimal skeleton, `BaseImageProcessorFast` includes all the fundamental functionalities needed for a basic image processor. This allows optimizations made in BaseImageProcessorFast to propagate to its inherited classes. Additionally, most repetitive logic for image loading and argument handling is managed within BaseImageProcessorFast. Except in rare cases, inherited classes do not need to handle image loading, conversion, or retrieving arguments from class attributes in the call/preprocess function, this is all handled in `BaseImageProcessorFast`.\n\n#### Getting Started\n\nRun the following command:\n```bash\ntransformers-cli add-fast-image-processor --model-name model_name\n```\nwhere `model_name` is the name of the model (as found in its folder under `transformers/src/transformers/models`) for which you're adding the fast image processor.\n\nThis command will handle all necessary imports and generate a basic fast image processor, which will look similar to this example for Beit:\n\n```python\n# coding=utf-8\n# Copyright 2025 The HuggingFace Inc. team.

The class attributes, such as `resample` and `image_mean`, are automatically parsed from the slow image processor when running the script above. However, you should verify their correctness and check for any missing or incorrectly assigned values.\n\n### Customizing the Image Processor\n\nIf the image processor requires additional functionalities beyond the basic augmentations, you will need to override the `_preprocess` function in `BaseImageProcessorFast`. Check the `_preprocess` implementation in `BaseImageProcessorFast` for reference. Notably, it leverages `group_images_by_shape` and `reorder_images` to enable batch processing, significantly increasing processing speed, particularly on GPUs. If you create new image processing functions, ensure they support batch processing by utilizing `group_images_by_shape` and `reorder_images` where possible.\n\nIf your image processor requires additional kwargs not present in [`DefaultFastImageProcessorKwargs`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/image_processing_utils_fast.py#L172), you must create a `ModelNameFastImageProcessorKwargs` class that inherits from `DefaultFastImageProcessorKwargs` and defines the new kwargs. Additionally, you should document the added kwargs in the class and the `preprocess` function using `add_start_docstrings`. (This documentation process may be simplified soon, but is necessary for now to get a correct documentation).\n\nFor an example of handling custom kwargs and documentation, refer to [LlavaNextImageProcessorFast](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/models/llava_next/image_processing_llava_next_fast.py).\n\n### Important Notes\n\n- In nearly all cases, `_preprocess` is the only function in `BaseImageProcessorFast` that needs to be overridden.\n- The `_preprocess` function does not require default values for its arguments, as they are automatically derived from class attributes if not explicitly provided.\n- Even if `PIL` images or `numpy` arrays are passed to the image processor, the `images` argument in `_preprocess` will always be a list of tensors, with the channel dimension first.\n\n### Handling Edge Cases\n\n- **Nested Images:** If images are provided as nested lists (e.g., `[[image1, image2], [image3]]`), they will be flattened to `[image1, image2, image3]` by default before being passed to `_preprocess`. This behavior can be modified by overriding `_prepare_images_structure`, though flattening is generally recommended.\n- **Formatting Custom  Kwargs:** If any custom kwargs require formatting before `_preprocess`, override `_further_process_kwargs`.\n- **Validating Custom Kwargs:** If additional validation is needed for custom kwargs or existing ones, override `_validate_preprocess_kwargs`.\n\n### Testing\n\nIn the case where the model already has a `test_image_processing_model_name.py` file under `transformers/tests/models/model_name`, the script ran before should have imported the fast image processor to the file, and added it as a `fast_image_processing_class` class attribute to the `ModelNameImageProcessingTest` class.\nHowever this is not enough to get all the tests to run on the fast image processor. For all the test functions under `ModelNameImageProcessingTest`, you need to replace `image_processing = self.image_processing_class(**self.image_processor_dict)` with a loop over `self.image_processor_list`.\n\nFor example, the `test_image_processor_properties` test in `test_image_processing_beit.py` which looks like this:\n\n```python\n    def test_image_processor_properties(self):\n        image_processing = self.image_processing_class(**self.image_processor_dict)\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"do_resize\"))\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"size\"))\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"do_center_crop\"))\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"center_crop\"))\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"do_normalize\"))\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"image_mean\"))\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"image_std\"))\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"do_reduce_labels\"))\n```\nshould be changed to this:\n\n```python\n    def test_image_processor_properties(self):\n        for image_processing_class in self.image_processor_list:\n            image_processing = image_processing_class(**self.image_processor_dict)\n            self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"do_resize\"))\n            self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"size\"))\n            self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"do_center_crop\"))\n            self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"center_crop\"))\n            self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"do_normalize\"))\n            self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"image_mean\"))\n            self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"image_std\"))\n            self.assertTrue(hasattr(image_processing, \"do_reduce_labels\"))\n```\n\nIn the case where no image processing test file is present, now is a great time to add one! You can have a look at the[ CLIP image processing test file](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/ad5d40de9c4d4899d5b79243f63e22c72e8b3669/tests/models/clip/test_image_processing_clip.py) to use as a simple starting point.\n\nDon't hesitate to add model-specific tests if you feel like there are some non-standard image processing techniques in the processor :).\n\nTo run the tests, use this command:\n```bash\nRUN_SLOW=1 python -m pytest tests/models/model_name/test_image_processing_model_name.py\n```\n\n\n### Choosing an Image Processor to Implement\n\nThe difficulty of implementing a fast image processor varies by model.

Good task for this week..!", "@edgarriba I love kornia! But for image processors at inference time, it might be a bit overkill since 90% of the time, we only need a mix of resizing, normalizing, padding, and cropping, combined with some model-specific logic. I???ve found that `torch`/`torchvision` functional transforms usually cover these needs well, and pipelines like kornia `ImageSequential` or torchvision `Compose` aren???t always a good fit because some models require additional processing steps or custom logic in between. We also wanted to avoid adding an extra dependency to Transformers for fast image processors.\n\nThat said, I do think kornia could be valuable down the line, especially for batch processing. I'm still exploring how to optimize batch processing performance on both GPU and CPU, and kornia likely handles this more efficiently than our current approach.", "The core of the library is pure functional -- that has been always the scope.

The root directory (`taskcluster`) is just a convention, so the fact that we're hardcoding it here, means any repo that has it configured in a non-standard place is going to break.\n\nThe kind name (`docker-image`) is also just a convention, so if a repo uses a different kind name for their docker-images, this will also break." ],

      "comments" : [ "Hi @mekarpeles,\r\n\r\nSuch a nice idea Mek, I???d love to work on this! Here???s my approach:\r\n\r\n->I???ll create a mockup to display the patron???s avatar, username as a link, and a Follow button. I???ll ensure the design matches the current style of the site, especially following the look of the My Books feed page, and I'll make sure to use existing CSS where possible.\r\n->I???ll update the backend to fetch public patron data (only if their reading log is public).\r\n->On the frontend, I???ll add the patron???s avatar, make the username a clickable link, and include a small \"Follow\" button. It will be  consistent with the existing follow functionality, ensuring patrons can easily follow others.\r\n\r\nAnd then for the testing, \r\n->After implementation, I???ll run tests for responsiveness, cross-browser compatibility, and edge cases like empty avatars or usernames. I???ll also check for smoothness with the follow feature.\r\n\r\nThis feature can help patrons discover more books through people they follow, and really could be the first step toward building social features on Open Library.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any feedback or suggestions! \uD83D\uDE0A", "Hi @SharkyBytes! Thanks for these details.\r\n\r\n> I???ll update the backend to fetch public patron data (only if their reading log is public).\r\n\r\nIt's _possible_ this part is done already! Or, I think we should take the approach of leaving it anonymous (if their reading log is private) and **otherwise** showing the new design. In either case, these two modes / design should hopefully be fairly consistent with each other.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to seeing your designs and we can bring them for feedback to either our Tuesday or Friday community calls!", "Here's one design that standardizes the `Catalog Card` from the search results page with `Events` that might appear on the `Feed` or `Trending Now` page(s)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"766\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-01-01 at 1 07 20???PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33281437-2303-46b7-b394-2424c6e478b5\" />\r\n\r\nIt proposes creating an augmented, extended version of the `Catalog Card` called a `Catalog Card Event`.\r\n\r\nThis would replace the current Trending Now card and make things a bit more standardized.\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4308be87-6d53-410a-9d90-51b20fddca6c)\r\n\r\nIt's at least something we can work towards in the meantime (and then discuss designs further).\r\n\r\nI think it will be important to develop things modularly such that the `Event` section can be reused in multiple contexts and that a `Catalog Card Event` component can be composed (as a template) by rendering a top `Event` section and then a `Catalog Card` (i.e. macro/SearchResultWork) below it.", "@SharkyBytes are you still working on this?", "Yeah, @ananyakaligal, I???m working on this. It???s almost done. I just need to check it with Mek now.", "Happy to provide a review when it's ready, thanks for working on this. Thanks for the offer to help @ananyakaligal! I'll followup on slack and see if we can work together to find a themed set of high impact issues to tackle together.", "Hi @mekarpeles,\r\n\r\nI???m currently working on this issue and am excited to start my contribution journey. I wanted to share an update with you and seek your advice.\r\n\r\nHere???s what I???ve accomplished so far:\r\n\r\n1. Successfully fetched the patron data.\r\n2. Added the follow button.\r\n3. Updated the underlined username link to redirect to the patron???s profile.\r\n4. Ensured the \"Want to Read\" link navigates correctly to the patron???s \"Want to Read\" section.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you???d like any adjustments to these features!\r\n\r\nThat said, I???m currently facing an issue with implementing the follow functionality (so the follow button works as expected). I???m actively working on resolving this, but if you have any suggestions, resources, or pointers that could save me from searching through the full codebase, it would be a huge help.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your guidance!\r\n\r\nCurrent Implementation :-\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cdcd0ca5-b777-4744-b059-803bcac9e393)\r\n", "@SharkyBytes great work so far:\r\n* Let's try to make the follow button follow the same type of style and classes as the rest of our buttons (e.g. consistent color and border-radius).\r\n* For the follow button, you may wish to consult the **Feed** https://openlibrary.org/people/mekBot/books/feed referenced in the original post, which uses the `Follow` macro: https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/blob/master/openlibrary/macros/Follow.html\r\n\r\n\r\n## What to do if a patron is not logged in?\r\n\r\nThis case is actually almost completely handled for us already by the `Follow` macro.\r\n\r\nIf a visitor navigates to the `/trending/now` page, the `Follow` macro will **already** show a real `Follow` button if they're logged in:\r\nhttps://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/pull/8607/files#diff-f8a08ee2ccd19673120d20e7bb9a9bb0522f49eed20aa98edd0007787058c302R7\r\n\r\nAnd if they're not logged in, an `else` condition will ensure the visitor get a `Follow` button that routes the visitor to login: \r\nhttps://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/pull/8607/files#diff-f8a08ee2ccd19673120d20e7bb9a9bb0522f49eed20aa98edd0007787058c302R16-R17\r\n\r\nThe `Follow` macro is built so that in this login case, a special request variable `ctx.path` (i.e. the current url of the page we're rendering) is computed, so that whatever page calls it can be  preserved by passing it along to the login endpoint request as a URL parameter called `?redir_url`, so after the patron logs in, they can be redirected back to the page they came from. In this case, `ctx.path` would know we're on the `/trending` page and so the login redirect will happen for us automatically.\r\n\r\n## Opportunity\r\n\r\nOne caveat of this flow is, by logging in, we're not actually completing the `Follow` the patron requested! They have to click `Follow`, login, go back to `/trending` and figure out that they have to click `Follow` again, which is both non-intuitive and may be difficult as the `/trending` page changes from moment to moment and so the person they were trying to follow may not be on the page anymore! \uD83E\uDD26 \r\n\r\nI'm considering this a **separate**, followup issue tracked here (which has a volunteer: @ShilpThapak):\r\n* #10338\r\n", "Hey @mekarpeles,\n\nI'm encountering an issue with the local instance of Open Library. I???ve set all reading activity to private, as shown in the image below. However, when I add books to the \"Want to Read\" section from my personal account, the system still displays my name and the section I added the book to. While the \"Want to Read\" link itself is protected (I can't view the detailed logs), it still reveals who added the book and where.\n\nAs we discussed earlier, the expected behavior should be to display something like \"Someone added to Want to Read\" instead of showing the user's name and activity details. Am I right?\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe39d381-a8dd-40c2-9348-c27a164d98b2)\n\nI???ve also tried debugging the entry, but I???m unsure which field determines whether the reading logs are private. In the entry, I noticed that both openlibrary and personal show None for the private field, which seems to indicate no restrictions. Could you clarify which field controls this behavior and if there's a potential issue with the logic handling privacy settings?\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/046cebfd-d268-40fd-bf14-584a9c471342)", "Also, @mekarpeles, I noticed another issue regarding avatars. As shown in the image below, the avatar isn???t displaying because the ` /people/test_username/avatar` redirects to the main archive site and shows \"Item not available.\"\n\nI had a detailed discussion about this with @scottbarnes, who was incredibly helpful. However, we???re now uncertain whether we should display a default avatar when no profile picture is available or if we should simply leave the avatar blank.\n\nWould love your thoughts on this!", "You'll need to fetch the patrons privacy value from their account setting object (you should be able to perform a get_many on all the patrons in one page) and conditionally load their name / follow buttons, etc. there may also be a private book on the reading log entry\n\nWe should use a default avatar if private \n\nWe can do the following to get a mapping of patrons to their privacy:\n```\nusernames = ['mekBot', 'ScarTissue', 'seabelis', 'brewster', 'jachamp']\nuser_prefs = web.ctx.site.get_many([f'/people/{username}/preferences' for username in usernames])\nfollowable = dict((user.key.split('/')[2], user.notifications.public_readlog == 'yes') for user in user_prefs)\n```", "@SharkyBytes are you still working on this?\n\nIf not, @mekarpeles Can I work on this?", "Hi, I'd love to work on this issue!", "@SharkyBytes, it seems like you've done a bit of work on this issue. Do you still plan to work on it? Otherwise, do you think you can push up the code you've worked on so far so others can help take the feature over the finish line and your commits still get included in the final result?", "@ragipidavid would you like to try this one? :) " ],

We ran into a few issues importing a forked version of the  repository into Eclipse IDE for committers and have provided some of the errors we encountered in the Q&A Discussion: https://github.com/eclipse-pde/eclipse.pde/discussions/1878. We would be happy to open a Pull Request soon to share our current state of work. So far, we have been reviewing the codebase and creating a plan for how we are going to add the missing package versions to exports.\n\nTo make sure we are on the right track, we would like to verify with you a plan we created based on our understanding of the codebase. We plan on: \n\n1. Adding a checkbox button to the **Organize Manifests Wizard Page.java** file that says \"add missing package versions on exports\" and two check box options to either ???use a fixed version (defaults to 1.0.0)??? or ???using the current bundle version???. \n2. Editing the **Organize_Manifests.html** file to specify the options we added to the Organize Manifests Wizard Page.\n3. Editing code in the **Organize Manifest Settings.java** file to add our new ???add missing version packages to exports??? as an available setting. \n4. Editing code in **Organize Manifests Processor.java file** to add an if statement case to check if the file being exported is missing a package version. We can use a Boolean value in case there are no missing package versions. \n5. Editing code in the **Organize Manifest.java** file to write a function that adds the missing package version for exports based on whether the user checked that they wanted a fixed version or a current bundle version. In the code we can reference from **ExportPackageObject.java** and use the versionAttribute or a custom object to assign the packages with the correct versions. Otherwise we assign a default version. \n\n\nWizard Preview: This is a preview of what the **Organize Manifest Wizard** may look like with the options to add missing package versions to exports; it will have separate options where the user can choose adding ???fixed versions to exported packages??? or using the ???current bundle version???. We referred to the documentation of the organize manifest wizard from the Eclipse PDE page so that the options we add match the exact design of the Organize Manifest Wizard: https://help.eclipse.org/latest/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.pde.doc.user%2Fguide%2Ftools%2Fpde_actions%2Forganize_manifests.htm\n\n<img width=\"720\" height=\"540\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5122d99a-41d6-4455-a1c2-bd8c56f3f031\" />\n\nBased on the current codebase for the organized manifest wizard, is our current plan for adding missing package versions on exports on the right track? Also, how may we include the tycho-cleancode:manifest to adding the correct versions of exported packages within the Organize Manifest Settings.java file? \n\nThank you for allowing us to work on this issue. We are working hard to add the options you suggested. Have a wonderful day. \n", "Your plan generally sounds good.\n\n> 1. Adding a checkbox button to the **Organize Manifests Wizard Page.java** file that says \"add missing package versions on exports\" and two check box options to either ???use a fixed version (defaults to 1.0.0)??? or ???using the current bundle version???.\n\nIn case a the fixed-version option is selected, you should probably also enable a text-box so that one can enter another version than the default.\n\n> We would be happy to open a Pull Request soon to share our current state of work.\n\nYes, please do so. You can also open a PR as draft if it's not yet fully completed. It's often easier to discuss implementations with some (preliminary) code-changes than just abstractly in an issue.\n\n\n> Also, how may we include the tycho-cleancode:manifest to adding the correct versions of exported packages within the Organize Manifest Settings.java file?\n\nYou don't have to worry about that part, that's another tool (i.e. a Plugin for Maven)\n\n" ],

", "Hi Everyone,\n\nI was able to reproduce the behavior that the original author reported with my team (@Dtran048,@kujoon226), PDE ignores the -osgi.splashLocation argument when launching. Here???s a high-level summary of what I did and how I worked around it:\n\n**Environment setup**\n- Installed Eclipse PDE and verified all plug-in dependencies resolve correctly.\n- Created a simple plug-in project named \"test\" and added a custom splash image at test/splash2.bmp.\n- Verified the issue\n- Launched with arguments:\n-os ${target.os} -ws ${target.ws} -arch ${target.arch} -nl ${target.nl}\n-consoleLog -clearPersistedState\n-osgi.splashLocation=platform:/plugin/test/splash2.bmp\nConfirmed that -showSplash 600 was honored but the splash image location was ignored.\n\n**I found a Workaround via .product file** to be able to display my custom splash screen.\n- Created test.product in the plug-in project and configured:\n- Product ID: test.product\n- Defining plug-in: test\n- Application: org.eclipse.ui.ide.workbench\n- Contents: added test\n- Splash tab: added plug-in test\n- Discovered PDE only recognizes a file named splash.bmp at the root of the selected plug-in, it won???t let you choose a different filename or path. (if you attempt splash2.bmp it'll not show any splash screen, not even default).\n\nFix for **workaround**:\n- Renamed splash2.bmp ??? splash.bmp in the root of the test plug-in.\n- Launched again and my custom splash now displays as expected.\n\nAssumption: Eclipse???s product???branding UI only ever looks for a file called???splash.bmp in the plug???in you point it at. It doesn???t let you pick an arbitrary filename, everything is hard???wired to the ???splash.bmp??? convention. That???s why renaming your image to splash2.bmp won???t work through the PDE product editor.\n\n<img width=\"474\" height=\"312\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a86b71a-8d99-4ea4-ade4-e1042a9f68b3\" />", "# Debugging PDE???s `EclipseApplicationLaunchConfiguration` to honor `-osgi.splashLocation`\n\nI???m trying to debug and modify the PDE ???launching??? plugin, specifically:\n\n[EclipseApplicationLaunchConfiguration.java](https://github.com/xsu0131/eclipse.pde/blob/master/ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/launching/EclipseApplicationLaunchConfiguration.java)  \n\n- so that it will read the `-osgi.splashLocation` argument at startup. My end goal is to pass in a splash???image path via command-line args (the way OSGi allows), rather than using the `.product` based workaround that forces me to rename my file to `splash.bmp`.\n\n### What I???ve tried\n\n1. **Importing the source**  \n   - Cloned `org.eclipse.pde.launching` into my workspace.  \n   - Confirmed it builds cleanly with my changes.\n\n2. **Setting breakpoints & debug prints**  \n   - Breakpoints at the top of `launch(...)` and `getArguments()`.  \n   - Added `System.out.println(\"DEBUG\");` statements.\n\n3. **Launching a debug instance**  \n   - Right-click ??? **Run As ??? Eclipse Application** on the PDE launching project.  \n   - In the runtime workbench I launch my test product with:\n\n-os ${target.os} -ws ${target.ws} -arch ${target.arch} -nl ${target.nl} -consoleLog -clearPersistedState-osgi.splashLocation=platform:/plugin/test/splash2.bmp\n\n- No breakpoints ever fire and no print output appears.\n\n4. **Drop-in export**  \n   - Exported my patched `org.eclipse.pde.launching` to a .jar file\n   - Placed it in the target platform???s `dropins/` folder.  \n   - Verified the version restarted the PDE, and cleaned the project.

And in that secondary Eclipse (workspace) you have to create yet another launch config for an Eclipse App/Product launch (similar as before, but you can probably just create a new one and include the default set of Plugin: `All workspace and enabled target Plug-ins`).

      "repositoryName" : "swiftlang/swift-docc",
      "description" : "### Feature Name\n\nSupport documenting tuple return value elements individually\n\n### Description\n\nCurrently, return value documentation in DocC applies to the entire return value as a whole. This makes sense for functions and methods that return a single value but for functions and methods that return tuples (especially tuples with named elements) it mean that the same paragraph has to describe both values and describe the tuple structure in the content. \n\nFor example, [the `quotientAndRemainder(dividingBy:)` method in Swift](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/int/quotientandremainder(dividingby:)) documents its return value as:\n\n> A tuple containing the quotient and remainder of this value divided by `rhs`. The remainder has the same sign as `lhs`.\n\nSimilarly, code in DocC itself uses the \"a pair of ...\" phrase to describe tuple return values:\n\n```swift\n/// ...\n/// - Returns: A pair of the parsed path components and a flag that indicate if the documentation link is absolute or not.\nstatic func parse(path: String) -> (components: [PathComponent], isAbsolute: Bool) \n\n/// ...\n/// - Returns: A pair of the matching elements and the remaining elements, that didn't match.\nfunc categorize<Result>(where matches: (Element) -> Result?) -> (matching: [Result], remainder: [Element]) \n```\n\nIn cases like this it could be helpful to be able to document each element of the tuple return value individually using a syntax similar to the way parameters are documented. For example:\n\n```swift\n/// ...\n/// - Returns:\n///   - quotient: the quotient of this value divided by `rhs`.\n///   - remainder: the remainder of this value divided by `rhs` with the same sign as the original value.\nfunc quotientAndRemainder(dividingBy rhs: Self) -> (quotient: Self, remainder: Self)\n\n/// ...\n/// - Returns:\n///   - component: the parsed path components.\n///   - isAbsolute: a flag that indicate if the documentation link is absolute or not.\nstatic func parse(path: String) -> (components: [PathComponent], isAbsolute: Bool) \n\n/// ...\n/// - Returns: \n///   - matching: the elements that match the predicate.\n///   - remainder: the elements that don't match the predicate.\nfunc categorize<Result>(where matches: (Element) -> Result?) -> (matching: [Result], remainder: [Element]) \n```\n\nNote: It's possible to write documentation markup like this today but the list items in the return value aren't presented the same as the items for the parameter documentation: \n\n<img width=\"649\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/000b7210-b17c-4380-af7e-91b76922eff0\" />\n\n-----\n\nDocC already knows how many elements the tuple return value contains, so it should be possible to raise warnings if the return value documentation describes too many or too few individual return values.\n\nIt's important that this is an additive change so that existing documentation for tuple return value don't change behavior or result in warnings. \n\nIn some cases the developer might also prefer to continue to document all tuple elements of the return value together. That should continue to be supported. \n\n\n### Motivation\n\nSee the description above for example use cases of documenting tuple return value elements individually.\n\n### Importance\n\nThis is a fairly unimportant enhancement. It doesn't enable any new use-cases and the markup for this is already supported but it doesn't render as well as it could on the page.\n\n### Alternatives Considered\n\n_No response_",

Here are a few places to start with:\n\n- [`TaggedListItemExtractor.visitListItem(_:)`][tag] is where DocC parses the markup in to a list of [`Return`][ret] structures, as well as all the other list items like parameters, throws, etc.\n\n- [`ReturnsSectionTranslator`][render] is where DocC creates JSON data for the renderer for each return sections. It's possible that we'd need [a new type of render section][spec] to display this. Maybe it's possible to unify some of the render sections. It looks to me like `ParametersRenderSection` and `PossibleValuesSection` are very similar already.\n\n  Maybe it's possible to define a more abstract render section kind that includes the section title which could be used for all 3 (parameters, possible values, and _named_ tuple return value elements).\n  /cc @mportiz08\n\n- [`ParametersAndReturnValidator.makeReturnsSectionVariants(_:_:documentedSymbolKind:swiftSymbolKind:hasDocumentedParameters:)`][validate] is where DocC checks the documented return value and warns if there's return value documentation for a function that only returns void. This code also creates specialized return value sections for each (programming) language if the symbol has different return values in different language representations (for example `Void` in Swift but `BOOL` in Objective-C).\n\nIn each of these places it could be good to compare the return value structures and processing to the parameters processing since parameter documentation already has individual named elements.\n\n[tag]: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-docc/blob/main/Sources/SwiftDocC/Utility/MarkupExtensions/ListItemExtractor.swift#L113\n[ret]: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-docc/blob/main/Sources/SwiftDocC/Model/Semantics/Return.swift#L14\n\n[render]: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-docc/blob/main/Sources/SwiftDocC/Model/Rendering/RenderSectionTranslator/ReturnsSectionTranslator.swift\n[spec]: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-docc/blob/main/Sources/SwiftDocC/SwiftDocC.docc/Resources/RenderNode.spec.json#L2460-L2499\n\n[validate]: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-docc/blob/main/Sources/SwiftDocC/Model/ParametersAndReturnValidator.swift#L287-L293\n", "Some of this code is `public` API. We don't want to break that unless it's necessary (see [Introducing source breaking changes][1] in CONTRIBUTING.md). \n\nIt's something to be aware of but you don't need to worry too much about it up front. We can iterate together in the PR to add deprecations and compatibility wrappers to avoid any source breaking changes, if there are any.\n\n[1]: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-docc/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#introducing-source-breaking-changes", "hey @d-ronnqvist i was trying to work on this, this is my first time trying to contribute, i was just wondering how could i test locally if my implementation works, i would appreciate any guidance you could give", "How I'd go about testing this would depend on which part I'm working on. If you're asking about visually verifying the results end-to-end then I that would probably involve:\n- defining a public function with a tuple return type in a new package\n- writing a documentation comment for that function that documents each tuple element\n- building documentation for that package to get the symbol graph output\n- passing that symbol graph output to the preview command of your locally built `docc` executable\n- navigating to the rendered preview page to see how the return value documentation looks on the page.\n\nThat said, if you're just getting started working on this, it will probably be easier to work on and verify a smaller piece before trying to verify the end-to-end result. \n\nOne place to start could be in [`ReturnsSectionTranslator`](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-docc/blob/main/Sources/SwiftDocC/Model/Rendering/RenderSectionTranslator/ReturnsSectionTranslator.swift) where you could hardcode some structure (which doesn't yet come from the documentation markup) to see if it's possible to render the name and documentation for each individual return value or if that requires [a new type or render section](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-docc/blob/main/Sources/SwiftDocC/SwiftDocC.docc/Resources/RenderNode.spec.json#L2460-L2499). Once you know what data the `ReturnsSectionTranslator` needs to output you can write an automated test for that. For here you could either:\n- gradually work your way backwards to [TaggedListItemExtractor.visitListItem(_:)](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-docc/blob/main/Sources/SwiftDocC/Utility/MarkupExtensions/ListItemExtractor.swift#L113) where the markup for return value sections is parsed\n- jump to [TaggedListItemExtractor.visitListItem(_:)](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-docc/blob/main/Sources/SwiftDocC/Utility/MarkupExtensions/ListItemExtractor.swift#L113) (where the markup for return value sections is parsed) and gradually work your way forward until you reach the [`ReturnsSectionTranslator`](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-docc/blob/main/Sources/SwiftDocC/Model/Rendering/RenderSectionTranslator/ReturnsSectionTranslator.swift) again.\n\nOnce you have you've connected the updated markup parsing code with the updated rendering code you'll be able to verify the happy case end-to-end. That's what some jokingly say is the first 90% done with an additional 90% remaining. \n\nWe would want to raise warnings if the developer documented a tuple return value for a function that doesn't return a tuple or documented three tuple elements when the function only returns a tuple with two elements. DocC does this sort of validation and warnings in [`ParametersAndReturnValidator.makeReturnsSectionVariants(_:_:documentedSymbolKind:swiftSymbolKind:hasDocumentedParameters:)`](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-docc/blob/main/Sources/SwiftDocC/Model/ParametersAndReturnValidator.swift#L287-L293).", "understood, will try working through this issue, with the points you have put, thank you!", "Hey @d-ronnqvist, \nSince there hasn't been recent activity, would it be okay if I start working on this? I'd really appreciate any guidance or tips you could share to get me started! \n\nAlso @GunjanRawat26 and @thisismanan, I saw you were involved earlier. If you have any progress or updates, I'd be glad to hear them so I can decide whether to pick this up. If you're struggling with any part, maybe we could try a collaborative approach to move it forward. Any advice would also be appreciated!\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you all.

Below is my understanding and proposed approach???please let me know if I???ve missed anything or made any incorrect assumptions. Thanks!\n\n1. **Issue interpretation:** A pod which is fully isolated for ingress must never receive any north/south traffic, even when fronted by a LoadBalancer or NodePort, unless that traffic is SNAT'd to the node IP (which, based on the discussion above, appears to be an expected and accepted exception). Becasue SNAT can occur before or after NetworkPolicy evaluation, the policy may be non-deterministically bypassed depending on the network plugin, cloud provider, or service implementation.\n \n2. **Goal interpretation:** Add a deterministic E2E test that verifies a fully isolated ingress policy blocks all traffic.\n\n3. **Proposed approach:** A test in `/kubernetes/test/e2e/network/loadbalancer.go` that:\n\t1. Deploys a simple HTTP echo-server Pod.\n\t2. Apply a NetworkPolicy with no ingress rules.\n\t3. Create a Service of  type `LoadBalancer` with `externalTrafficPolicy: Local` (to preserve client IP and avoid kube-proxy SNAT/cross-node proxying)\n\t4. From e2e host, attempt to  curl the LoadBalancer IP (and the NodePort on that node).\n\t\t- Pass if connection times out/refuses\n\t\t- Fail if it succeeds\n\n4. **Questions / Considerations:**\n\t- **Test Location**: Should this live under `/kubernetes/test/e2e/network/netpol/network_policy.go` (to keep all NP tests together), or is `network/loadbalancer.go` more appropriate given the LB focus and fact that the current tests in `netpol/network_policy.go` test pod -> pod, while this test requires external -> pod via LB/NodePort.\n\t- **NodePort coverage:** Is an additional test needed for pod ??? Service(NodePort) traffic, since this can also involve SNAT and might expose similar bypass behavior?\n\t- **Underlying non-determinism:** Even with `externalTrafficPolicy: Local` or host-based testing, the root cause, SNAT ordering vs. policy enforcement, remains unpredictable. Can/does this underlying issue need to be addressed?", "> * **Test Location**\n\nProbably `tests/e2e/network/netpol/network_policy.go` should be moved up a level to `test/e2e/network/network_policy.go` (based on the comments in that file, it seems like maybe that was the original plan?), and `netpol/` should only contain the helpers, not the actual e2e tests themselves. And then the new test can be added to `test/e2e/network/network_policy.go`?\n\nNote that wherever it ends up, the test will need both `feature.NetworkPolicy` and `feature.LoadBalancer`.\n\n> * **NodePort coverage**\n\nThe non-`externalTrafficPolicy: Local` case is expected to do SNAT and the `externalTrafficPolicy: Local` case for NodePort is not interestingly different from the LoadBalancer IP case, so there's probably no point in testing this separately.\n\n> * **Underlying non-determinism**\n\nIt's not really \"non-determinism\"; any given environment is deterministic. And some people will run the e2e suite in environments that will fail the test due to SNAT. So I think the result should be:\n- connection is blocked: **Pass**\n- connection is accepted with original source IP preserved: **Fail**\n- connection is accepted with source IP changed: **Skip**\n\nI think having the test skip itself when it detects SNAT is preferable to just telling people \"you should skip this test if your environment doesn't support it\", because you're only supposed to skip it if the connection gets through because your load balancer did the \"wrong\" thing, _not_ if the connection gets through because your _network plugin_ does the wrong thing.", "/assign", "Hey @Yash-xoxo, I've still been working on this and plan to push a PR this week! ", "@danwinship, sorry for the slow progress on this one.  I wrote the new e2e test and moved the netpol tests one level up as you suggested in your above comment. \n\nTo validate the  \"connection is accepted with source IP changed: Skip\" path however, I've spend quite a while (attempting) to reproduce, on KIND, the the scenario where SNAT lets traffic bypass the default-deny network policy (Using eTP: Cluster, as I'll touch on below).\n\nAs I was having difficultly I took a step back, and started to wonder if this branch is even needed for the following reasons:\n\n- With eTP = Local, client IP preservation is mandatory (mentioned [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/4632#discussion_r1603346835)), so any SNAT would already violate the eTP = Local contract.\n- The test, as I implemented it, is \"should enforce default-deny ingress policy against LoadBalancer traffic with ExternalTrafficPolicy: Local\". Based on this if the connection is accepted, then either:\n  1. The NetPol was bypasssed\n  2. eTP = Local didnt preserve the client IP (SNAT)\n\nIn both scenarios I would think the test should simply fail, rather than requiring special \"SNAT detection\" logic. I was wondering however if this matches what you had in mind or if I am misunderstanding something/ overlooking an edge case." ],

That function pulls all application extensions using `findExtensions(\"org.eclipse.core.runtime.applications\", true)`. Looking into `findExtensions()`, we noticed that it does not currently check whether the extension is available based on the product's dependencies.\n\nCan you please help us check our understanding?

This method ultimately calls `PDECore.getDefault().getExtensionsRegistry().findExtensions(\"org.eclipse.core.runtime.applications\", true)`. \n\n<img width=\"1055\" height=\"792\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81254760-8ee1-4dd7-90da-455226085b1e\" />\n\nAs you can see from this screenshot, we've confirmed this displays many applications. \n\nWhat we've tried so far:\n\n- We've reviewed the implementation of `findExtensions` in `PDEExtensionRegistry.java` and noticed that when `activeOnly` is set to true, it filters using `PluginRegistry.getActiveModels()`.\n- We've also tried modifying the logic in the `else` block of `findExtensions` to change how extensions are gathered, but this had no impact on what was shown in the application dropdown list in the .product UI, which led us to wonder whether the filtering of applications needs to happen earlier or somewhere else. \n\n<img width=\"1041\" height=\"793\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6fa68b6-6488-41f2-b5d3-1775b7266086\" />\n\n\nOur current hypothesis is that the list of applications should be filtered down to only include those contributed by plugins that the current project explicitly needs, and therefore, we may need to update the UI logic to filter these based on what plugins are currently selected or included. \n\n\nCould you please confirm if our understanding is correct? Should the application dropdown ideally be filtered based on the current plugin???s dependencies? And if so, is there a separate step or location in the codebase where this filtering is intended to happen? Any insight/clarification would be very helpful! Thank you very much. ", "> Our assumption is that the missing SDK and/or dependencies are why the selected application cannot be found in the registry.\n> \n> To investigate deeper, we added debug changes in the `getApplicationNameSet()` method, which controls the dropdown list of available applications in the .product file UI. That function pulls all application extensions using `findExtensions(\"org.eclipse.core.runtime.applications\", true)`. Looking into `findExtensions()`, we noticed that it does not currently check whether the extension is available based on the product's dependencies.\n> \n> Can you please help us check our understanding? Does our understanding of how the .product file and application registration work seem correct?\n\nYes that's absolutely correct and the root cause of the problem.\n\n> Our current hypothesis is that the list of applications should be filtered down to only include those contributed by plugins that the current project explicitly needs, and therefore, we may need to update the UI logic to filter these based on what plugins are currently selected or included.\n\nYes the list should be filtered to only include the applications provided by plugins included into the launch. You can obtain the provider's name easily using:\n`String name = elements[0].getContributor().getName();`\n\nSo the only missing part is to obtain the list of bundles/plugins included into a product and then that list/set should be passed to the `getApplicationNameSet()` (probably only the internal method). But for the former no trivial solution exists yet.\nNevertheless the building blocks exists, but have to be assembled.\n\nThe computation of all Plugins included in a launch can be done using (using `osgi=false`):\nhttps://github.com/eclipse-pde/eclipse.pde/blob/260640d9827f44452bd0e03d1baea7efe3ab191b/ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/launching/launcher/BundleLauncherHelper.java#L110\n\nUnfortunately this methods requires a launch configuration as input, so I suggest to create a temporary (hidden) one on the fly to call that method with. To do that you can create a new `org.eclipse.pde.internal.ui.launcher.LaunchAction` for the current product and call `findLaunchConfiguration()`. Maybe we should introduce a new method that always creates a new config and never saves it to prevent it from becoming visible in the UI. \n", "\n> The computation of all Plugins included in a launch can be done using (using `osgi=false`):\n> \n> [eclipse.pde/ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/launching/launcher/BundleLauncherHelper.java](https://github.com/eclipse-pde/eclipse.pde/blob/260640d9827f44452bd0e03d1baea7efe3ab191b/ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/launching/launcher/BundleLauncherHelper.java#L110)\n> \n> Unfortunately this methods requires a launch configuration as input, so I suggest to create a temporary (hidden) one on the fly to call that method with.

There is already a method for exactly that purpose:\nhttps://github.com/eclipse-pde/eclipse.pde/blob/260640d9827f44452bd0e03d1baea7efe3ab191b/ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/launcher/LaunchAction.java#L98-L104\n\nFrom the returned set you can get the symbolic-names from all bundles in the launch (and if you want to be very exact, also their IDs)." ],

Do we want to group safety with intersections or with transportation? Arguably the intersections are a type of safety callout, but perhaps the point of separating the intersection callout toggle is to allow everything except intersections to continue being called out.", "That's a great point :-) Perhaps we split out all 3 separately? All the other Callout options are quite binary whereas this one currently incorporates 3 different types...so splitting them out will allow a person to fine-tune the information they wish to hear. It will increase the panel and require more scrolling for the page...but I think it's worth doing. ", "\nI could also argue that the safety spots callout should remain on unless the user decides to turn all callouts off. In the early days of Microsoft Soundscape, there used to be a toggle switch for the Location Updates callout, but starting around the early 2020's,the Location Updates callout became permanently turned on and cannot directly be configured by the user. My argument to leave safety spots on is so that the user is always aware of anything hazardous while walking around. That way the \"Manage Callouts\" menu wouldn't be cluttered with too many configurations. If we decide to go ahead with my solution, I also wrote a revision to the help documentation explaining \"Note: some callouts essential for safe navigation do not have their own toggle switch and can only be disabled with the \"Allow Callouts\" button.\" Anyway, having all three callouts in this section or just Transportation and Intersections will be an improvement, even for sighted users. The term Mobility isn't as intuitive for the average user.", "I can look into this ", "Do we know which files in the backend are connected to the different toggles that we want from the Mobility section? ", "The code where the single toggle is changing three separate settings is here: https://github.com/soundscape-community/soundscape/blob/6a84924d63fc0a2542abac51d8c823832f0330d7/apps/ios/GuideDogs/Code/Visual%20UI/Controls/Settings/CalloutSettingsCellView.swift#L84-L90\n\nThe visual design for the toggle is in a storyboard: https://github.com/soundscape-community/soundscape/blob/6a84924d63fc0a2542abac51d8c823832f0330d7/apps/ios/GuideDogs/Code/Visual%20UI/Views/Settings.storyboard#L270-L317\n\nThat's all you should really need to tweak for this feature. You don't need to dive into how those settings are used by the `AutoCalloutGenerator` to filter the announcements.", "Just for clarification, I separated Transportation and Intersection into 2 different toggles. Before I make a pull request I want to confirm that we get rid of the Mobility toggle altogether and it just be the 2 new toggles?", "Based on your description, it looks like you are using my suggestion of leaving the safety callouts on permanently without a toggle switch. It might be a good idea to look at the advantages and drawbacks of the two suggestions. Would we rather have fewer toggle switches or a more customizable UI? My own suggestion has the safety callouts to not have a toggle switch so that the user is always aware of them in order to stay safe while walking. This may be good with cane or guide dog travel or for those individuals who are less experienced with O&M because a mobility device alone may not catch some safety spots. This solution also produces a less cluttered UI. You could argue in favor of the previous suggestion from Jchudge that having a toggle for safety callouts so the user turns off everything except for intersections may produce a more streamlined listening experience. That solution could be great for very experienced cane travelers who don't need that much guidance from Soundscape's callouts. The drawback is that the list of toggle switches looks a bit too long and overwhelming for beginners. Should we take a vote or something? Thanks.", "Mmm, I don't think we should make safety callouts permanently on.  There's a valid use case for the app  for low-vision non-cane users who don't need assistance finding steps and crosswalks but just want to hear road and shop signs they can't read.\n\nI'd suggest making three toggles, for mobility, transportation, and intersections. This shouldn't be much more difficult than two toggles, since the setting is already split into three under the hood.", "Thanks, since I don't object to having three separate toggle switches, should the new buttons be labeled \"Transportation,\" \"Intersections,\" and \"Safety?\" What should we do with the old \"Mobility\" switch? I assume that the \"Mobility\" or \"Safety\" button would be redundant if both buttons are in the UI so I think we can try either of two solutions. If we keep the \"Mobility\" label, and use the safety callouts for that label, then we should create an accessibility hint like \"Info for safe navigation.\" If you would rather go with \"Safety\" as the new callout name, the hint for the button could be written as \"Info for safe mobility.\" I can't come up with a good hint description right now, but you should get the gist. After everything is put together, the final list should be \"\"Allow Callouts,\" Places & Landmarks,\" \"Mobility\" or \"Safety,\" \"Transportation,\" \"Intersections,\" \"Distance to the Audio Beacon\" and \"Repeat Callouts.\" Maybe the order of callouts can be switched around a bit. Since the old \"Mobility\" hint said \"Intersection and Transportation Info,\" it may be better to put the \"Transportation\" button after the \"Intersection\" button for consistency.", "Ah, good point, the three categories should actually be Mobility, Safety, and Intersections. The \"Mobility\" category encompasses some random stuff that aren't directly related to modes of transportation, like ATMs and NaviLens codes.\n\nHere's a stab at the new hint text:\n* Mobility: Practical features like crosswalks and bus stops.\n* Safety: Potential hazards like steps and construction areas\n* Intersections: Announce street names and their directions", "So how I'm understanding what the final list should look like is this: \"Allow Callouts,\" \"Places & Landmarks,\" \"Mobility,\" \"Safety,\" \"Intersections,\" \"Distance to Audio Beacon,\" and \"Repeat Callouts.\" BTW, thanks for the new accessibility hints.", "> So how I'm understanding what the final list should look like is this: \"Allow Callouts,\" \"Places & Landmarks,\" \"Mobility,\" \"Safety,\" \"Intersections,\" \"Distance to Audio Beacon,\" and \"Repeat Callouts.\"\n\nYep, that sounds right to me.\n\n", "This message is for MBtheOtaku. I saw some of the changes in your \"Log Of Changes\" pull request, but it's better if you open a PR just for this issue. When you open up a new PR, be sure to put in the localized text for the new callouts and hints into the strings. That way, when it gets merged, I can be able to translate everything to Spanish on Weblate. BTW, I already have the text of Steinbro's hints in Spanish in my notes so I can just copy and paste.

The LaTeX code can then be compiled into a professional resume. Since the final output is a compiled LaTeX PDF, it will not be flagged as AI-generated, ensuring that candidates??? resumes reach recruiters without bias.\n\nI plan to create an API endpoint for this resume-building service, making it accessible and easy to integrate.

      "description" : "## Description \uD83D\uDCF9\n\nModify `refreshDiscordMember` in `utils\\discord\\refreshRoles.ts` to sync a new database document that tracks role assignment logic. The document should include `discordMemberId`, `discordServerConfigId`, `shouldHaveRole`, and `date` (timestamp of last change). If `shouldHaveRole` doesn't change, the `date` field should remain the same. The document must be unique for each `discordMemberId` and `discordServerConfigId` combination, requiring the creation of a new table using TypeORM.\n\n## Proposed Actions \uD83D\uDEE0???\n\nHere???s a checklist of actions to follow for resolving this issue:\n\n1. **Fork and Create Branch**:  \n   Fork the repository and create a new branch using the issue number:\n   \n```bash\n   git checkout -b fix-[issue-number]\n```\n\n2. **Implement Changes**:  \n- [ ] Create a new TypeORM entity named `DiscordRoleSyncStatus` with fields:\n  - `id` (primary key)\n  - `discordMemberId`\n  - `discordServerConfigId`\n  - `shouldHaveRole`\n  - `date`\n  - Add a unique constraint on `discordMemberId` + `discordServerConfigId`\n- [ ] Create a corresponding migration to add the new table\n- [ ] Modify `refreshDiscordMember`:\n  - [ ] After computing `shouldHaveRole`, upsert a document in `DiscordRoleSyncStatus`\n  - [ ] Only update `date` if `shouldHaveRole` value has changed\n  - [ ] Ensure existing records are fetched before inserting to compare the previous `shouldHaveRole` value\n  - [ ] Add error handling and logging if needed\n\n3. **Run Tests and Commit Changes**:  \n   Make sure your changes don't break existing functionality and commit with a clear message:\n   \n```bash\n   git commit -m \"Fix: Sync DiscordRoleSyncStatus in refreshDiscordMember function\"\n```\n\n## Required \uD83D\uDCCB\n\nTo keep our workflow smooth, please make sure you follow these guidelines:\n\n- **Assignment**: Don't create a pull request if you weren???t assigned to this issue.\n- **Timeframe**: Complete the task within **3 business days**.\n- **Closing the Issue**: In your PR description, close the issue by writing Close #[issue_id].\n- **Review Process**:\n  - Once you've submitted your PR, change the label to **\"ready for review\"**.\n  - If changes are requested, address them and then update the label back to **\"ready for review\"** once done.\n- **Testing**: Test your PR locally before pushing, and verify that tests and build are working after pushing.\n\nThank you for your contribution \uD83D\uDE4F\n\n??????

Use arrow keys to control the snake.\"*\n* Displaying this message in a visible area (e.g., above or below the canvas).\n* Including a **\"Start\" overlay** that disappears when the game begins.\n\n---\n\n### Benefits\n\n* Makes the game more intuitive.\n* Reduces user confusion.\n* Enhances overall user experience.\n\n---\n\nAs a GSSoC'25 contributor, I???d love to work on this issue and submit a PR with the proposed enhancement. Kindly consider assigning this to me.",

I???ll keep the changes minimal and focused. Thanks! \uD83D\uDE0A", "??? **Issue Acknowledged & Assigned**\n\nThanks @Jai-76 for identifying this UI/UX improvement opportunity for the **Tech News & Opportunities** section. Enhancing readability and interactivity will definitely boost user engagement and make updates more scalable.\n\n\uD83D\uDEE0??? Assigning this issue to you under **GSSOC???25**.\n\nFeel free to:\n\n* Use cards or timeline layouts for announcements\n* Add filter/search functionality\n* Implement hover effects or collapsible sections for better UX\n\nLooking forward to your PR! Let us know if you need component references or design input. \uD83D\uDE80\n\n\n?????? Do not remove or change any existing code unrelated to your issue!\nIf your PR modifies or deletes any core code without purpose, it will not be merged.\n\n\uD83D\uDCFD??? Always try to attach a short screen recording or screenshots of your work to validate your implementation.\n\n\n\uD83D\uDEA8 Important Reminder Before You Start! \uD83D\uDEA8\n\nHey folks \uD83D\uDC4B,\n\n\uD83D\uDD10 Login / Sign Up Now Live!\n\uD83D\uDE80 The Login/Sign Up flow is now fully integrated and appears first for both:\n\n\uD83D\uDC64 Users\n\uD83D\uDEE1??? Admins\n??? What Works:\n\nYou can navigate, explore, and use the interface smoothly.\nRole-based views and pages are set up and ready.\n?????? What???s Pending:\n\n\uD83D\uDCC2 Database Integration (MongoDB Atlas) is not connected by default.\n\uD83D\uDD04 To make authentication work completely (i.e., store user credentials, prevent duplicate signups, etc.), you must connect your own MongoDB database.\n\uD83E\uDDEA Developer Note:\n\nThe current setup uses dummy credentials without DB persistence. You need to set your MONGODB_URI in the backend .env to activate full backend functionality.\n\n\uD83D\uDCA1 Always make sure to pull the latest changes from the main branch before you start working on your feature or bug fix!\nThis helps you avoid merge conflicts and keeps your work in sync with the current codebase. ???\n\n\uD83D\uDD04 Steps to follow:\n\n1?????? Switch to your local branch\n2?????? Run: git pull origin main ??????\n3?????? Then start working on your issue \uD83D\uDCBB???\n\n\uD83D\uDE80 When you're done and ready to push:\n\n4?????? Run: git pull origin main again to make sure it's still up-to-date\n5?????? Resolve any small conflicts (if any) \uD83D\uDD27\n6?????? Then push your work: git push origin your-branch-name \uD83D\uDCE4\n\nThis keeps the project clean, conflict-free, and easier to merge! \uD83D\uDCAF\n\nLooking forward to your amazing contributions \uD83D\uDCBB??? ??? let???s build something truly impactful together! \uD83D\uDE80\uD83D\uDD25\n\nKeep innovating, keep elevating! \uD83C\uDF1F\uD83D\uDCA1\n\n???

If you would like to go ahead with implementing this, please let me know and I can assign it to you.\n\nOne thing to be aware of is that you will need to add a new string in the `L.dart` class file for the `Downloaded` option. Please see the [TRANSLATION.md](https://github.com/amugofjava/anytime_podcast_player/blob/master/TRANSLATION.md) file on how Anytime handles translations. For a single word, Google Translate/Bing Translator are useful for translating labels into the supported languages. If you don't feel comfortable handling the translations, don't worry, this can be done later.\n\nI do have a really busy couple of weeks coming up and I may be slow to respond to questions and PRs, so please bear with me. Thanks.", "i did fork the repo and looked it up and i am sure i could contribute to it...i will too try with the translation .\nThank you for the response...", "are these the correct implementation?\nshould i open a pr\nthis is when none option is selected from the filter episodes\n<img width=\"411\" height=\"390\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a77993b-7035-4671-bedf-52285e26230b\" />\n\nthis is when downloaded option is selected from the filter episodes\n<img width=\"407\" height=\"351\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28d3d938-212c-4aac-8e4e-1a1f79dd75b0\" />\n\nthe downloaded option\n<img width=\"407\" height=\"367\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9cb9ec2-ea44-4610-9826-cd80a284be0e\" />\n\nis this what the issue intented?", "Hi @sandy4242,\n\nYes, that is what was intended.

      "description" : "**Describe the bug**\nThe \"Project Vault\" website currently features \"Quick Links\" and \"Keep In Touch\" sections (including a small contact form snippet) that are repeatedly displayed at the bottom of every page. While a website's footer commonly contains quick links, the prominent and identical repetition of these larger sections on every content page adds significant visual clutter and redundancy. This is particularly noticeable given the presence of a dedicated \"Contact Us\" page.\n\nThis structural repetition impacts the overall design coherence and user experience by presenting the same content multiple times, even when a user navigates between different sections of the site.\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n1. Go to the Home page.\n2. Scroll to the bottom of the page and observe the \"Quick Links\" and \"Keep In Touch\" sections.\n3. Navigate to the About Us, FAQ, Contact Us, Webfolio, Games, or ML Projects pages.\n4. Scroll to the bottom of each of these pages.\n5. **See error**: The identical \"Quick Links\" and \"Keep In Touch\" sections are repeated on every page.\n\n**Expected behavior**\nThe \"Quick Links\" and \"Keep In Touch\" sections should ideally be integrated more strategically within the website's structure to avoid redundancy. This could involve:\n\n- Consolidating \"Quick Links\" into a standard, less prominent footer that appears once.\n- Removing the repeated \"Keep In Touch\" section on content pages, directing users to the dedicated \"Contact Us\" page for inquiries.\n- Ensuring these elements enhance, rather than detract from, the content of individual pages.\n\n**Screenshots**\n\n<img width=\"1898\" height=\"914\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70d210ee-1e86-4708-934f-b1d009047b4a\" />\nBottom of About Us Page showing the exact same sections.\n\n<img width=\"1901\" height=\"918\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5274f062-ce53-499c-a80b-8e9a0ed5c94d\" />\n\n**Desktop :**\n - OS: Windows 11\n - Browser: Chrome\n - Version: 136.0.0.0\n\n**Smartphone :**\n- Device: Galaxy A15\n- OS: Android 14\n- Browser: Chrome\n- Version: 138.0.7204.63\n\n**Additional context**\nThis issue is observed across different browsers and on mobile devices as well, indicating a consistent design choice rather than a rendering bug. Addressing this will significantly improve the website's cleanliness and navigation flow.\n",

Do you have any specific requirements for the default avatar (e.g., size, shape, or style)?

For Vitest, are there any existing tests or patterns I should follow when adding tests for the new API and UI components?\r\n\r\nLet me know how you'd like me to proceed. Thanks!", "@mdimado These are excellent questions. Apologies on delay in the reply. \r\n1.  Yeah I think the predefined user icon should be something from the bootstrap-icons library\r\n- https://icons.getbootstrap.com/icons/person-circle/ \r\n- I will leave the icon choice up to your design but I think a person-circle would good.\r\n1.2 The image retrieval API is something we don't have yet. We could do something similar to \r\n`frontend/pages/api/next/screenshot` where read that from the file path on the machine. \r\n2.  We have a lot of tests under /frontend/__tests__/\r\n- For API you might need to mock a successful return or put a dummy image in `../data/uploads/profile-pictures`", "Id like to work on this plus the modal, are they up for grabs?\nAre the modal requirements and data to be able to change decided yet?" ],

And the admin can also add a message\nlike ETA of return to service, etc.\nI would be happy if there was a possibility, for example, that maintenance mode starts, the monitor will change to \"maintenance mode - up\" so that it will still check but will not send notifications\n\nThanks!!",

It's not possible to ask our users to install a legacy version of ffmpeg, especially since it will require users to build from the source.\n\nTo fix this, we have to decide to use the latest LTS version, 7.1, which is in active maintenance mode.\n\nI believe API changes will be between the current version, 6.0.0, and the new version (7.1.1). So, the current implementation of the wasmedge-ffmpeg plugin will also need to be modified.\n\n\n### Details\n\nThe following action items should be finished:\n\n- [ ] Update to the new ffmpeg version 7.1.1\n- [ ] Modify the implementation of wasmedge-ffmpeg\n- [ ] Ensure the CI passes for building and testing\n\n### Appendix\n\n_No response_",

As a result, I have to manually delete things in reverse order with this kind of script in [Spanner Studio](https://pantheon.corp.google.com/spanner/instances/staging-spanner/databases/staging-database/details/query;showWriteDdlOptInBanner=true?project=webstatus-dev-internal-staging):\r\n```sql\r\n-- Delete from WPTRunFeatureMetrics\r\nDELETE FROM WPTRunFeatureMetrics WHERE WebFeatureID = 'IDHERE';\r\n\r\n-- Delete from BrowserFeatureAvailabilities\r\nDELETE FROM BrowserFeatureAvailabilities WHERE WebFeatureID = 'IDHERE';\r\n\r\n-- Delete from FeatureBaselineStatus\r\nDELETE FROM FeatureBaselineStatus WHERE WebFeatureID = 'IDHERE';\r\n\r\n-- Delete from FeatureSpecs\r\nDELETE FROM FeatureSpecs WHERE WebFeatureID = 'IDHERE';\r\n\r\n-- Finally, delete the web feature itself\r\nDELETE FROM WebFeatures WHERE ID = 'IDHERE';\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n1. Go to the [data](https://pantheon.corp.google.com/spanner/instances/staging-spanner/databases/staging-database/tables/WebFeatures/details/data?project=webstatus-dev-internal-staging) section in GCP\r\n2. Find the row I want to delete\r\n3. Select the checkbox and hit delete at the top\r\n4. Delete successful\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis is meant for permanently deleting features. There is a workaround using the script above. But this would be a one button click if these tables had ON DELETE CASCADE.\r\n\r\nFor temporarily hiding, we can continue to use the ExcludeFeatures table. That should not be touched\r\n",

To give one example, if I'm quoting a brief passage that contains quotation marks???\n\n> During this time the  meanings of \"liveness\" and \"presence\" were indistinguishable from Western discourses of modernization.\n\n???I'll need to convert the double-quotes used in the quotation to single-quotes in my paper, like so:\n\n> Lisa Parks argues that \"during this time the  meanings of 'liveness' and 'presence' were indistinguishable from Western discourses of modernization.\"\n\nThis sort of thing can be done by hand or with find-replace (if find-in-region were a thing in Zettlr; see #4040). But it's also the sort of yak shaving/repetitive task that cries out for automation, particularly when using a tool like Zettlr that contains other features of advanced text editors.\n\n### Proposed Changes\n\nMany programming text editors contain a menu or sub-menu from which users can select text transformations that are common in programming, such as changing tabs to spaces, toggling upper and lower case characters, straightening quotes, etc. For instance, BBEdit has a killer `Text` menu:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/caa059ea-7846-462f-8763-fa0e57431161)\n\nI'm suggesting that Zettlr add a similar menu or sub-menu populated with text transformations that are common in academic or journalistic writing. These could include:\n\n- Double quotes to single quotes. (See above.)\n- Single quotes to double quotes.\n- Italics to quotes (e.g., for changing `_Cultures in Orbit_` to `\"Cultures in Orbit\"` to satisfy a different style guide.)\n- Quotes to italics.\n- Join lines (a.k.a. unfill-region, see #4039)\n- Sentence case to title case.\n- Title case to sentence case.\n\n???and possibly others.\n\nPossible locations for these menu items could include the edit menu (or a sub-menu under the edit menu), the right-click context menu when text is selected in the editor, or a top-of-screen toolbar button. Some of the most commonly used transforms might also be given their own keyboard shortcuts.\n\n### Caveats\n\nNone.\n\n### Do you Wish to Attempt Implementing this Yourself?\n\nNo\n\n### Zettlr Version\n\nNightly\n\n### Your Platform\n\n- [ ] Windows\n- [ ] macOS\n- [x] Linux\n\n### Operating System Version\n\nManjaro (Rolling)\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_",

Similarly, text cut and pasted from LaTeX documents will often have pairs of single quotes and/or backticks in place of double-quotes. A transform that converted paired single quotes and paired backticks to double-quotes would come in handy from time to time.\n- Different style guides advise for or against using spaces on either side of emdashes.

I think the older #4039 may also be a sub-issue of this now.", "Good catch, added!", "@richdouglasevans and @nathanlesage ??? As promised, here is a composite PDF from which you can glean text to test the various transforms.\n\nBelow are the representative passages for cutting and pasting. I notice that the cut-and-paste behavior differs somewhat depending on the PDF viewer from which the text is copied to the clipboard. Zotero's on-board PDF viewer, for example, seems to replace line breaks with extra spaces, while other PDF viewers introduce hard wraps for each line of text. In any case, here goes:\n\nThis passage from Lisa Parks' _Cultures in Orbit_ demonstrates #5680 (paired quotes to double quotes):\n\n```\nOur World???s structure established precedents for subsequent\nglobal television coverage, alternating between live views of the television\nstudio, maps, and remote locations, interpellating the viewer not only as\n??????globally present?????? but as ??????culturally worldly?????? and ??????geographically mobile.??????\nSeen by millions of viewers throughout North America and Europe, this\nearly experiment helped to determine one of the cultural forms of satellite\ntelevision.\n```\n\nWhen I paste it from Zotero's PDF viewer, instead of the hard wraps, I get #5679 (duplicate spaces):\n\n```\nOur World???s structure established precedents for subsequent  global television coverage, alternating between live views of the television  studio, maps, and remote locations, interpellating the viewer not only as  ??????globally present?????? but as ??????culturally worldly?????? and ??????geographically mobile.??????  Seen by millions of viewers throughout North America and Europe, this  early experiment helped to determine one of the cultural forms of satellite  television.\n```\n\nThis passage from Evans and Ludgren's _No Heavenly Bodies_ has some wicked hard wraps that could be resolved with #4039 / unfill-region (Zotero again changes these wraps to duplicate spaces):\n\n```\nThe launch of Sputnik and Yuri Gagarin???s flight, of course, ??were impor??tant\nlandmarks of the Space Race and widely considered to be significant victo-\nries for the Soviet ??Union during the Cold War. 2 However, the act of broad-\ncasting Gagarin???s return to Moscow to audiences in Western ?? E\nurope was not\nan example of unidirectional propaganda, but rather a cooperative effort\nby broadcasters in both the Soviet U\n ?? nion and ??Europe.3\n```\n\nThis passage from Patrick Robert Parsons' _Blue Skies_ has more hard wraps, as well as smart quotes, both single and double, to be straightened (#5675). Once straightened, the quotes could also be used to test #5686 (converting between double and single quotes). It also has an emdash with no spaces around it (#5681): \n\n```\nThe consumer could choose from\nthree-inch tubes to ???giant??? twenty-inch screens, as well as direct view pic-\nture tubes or early ???projection screen??? receivers. None of the sets were cheap.\nPrices ranged from $99 to nearly $5,000 for custom-built models.12 The av-\nerage selling price was around $575 in 1947 and, although prices came down\na bit each year, it was still a costly adventure.13 As historians Christopher\nSterling and Michael Kittross noted: ???The typical 5-inch to 7-inch receiver\ncost from $375 to $500 in mid-1948???several weeks??? pay for the average\nworker. \n```\n\nAnd the excerpt of the interview with Whitney Phillips from Nieman Lab contains emdashes that do have spaces around them (#5681):\n\n```\nOur world is awash in mis- and disinformation. Conspiratorial thinking\nand misguided beliefs and attitudes towards science are widespread. But\ncombatting this deluge of problematic information must be done with care.\nToo often, argues Whitney Phillips, we dismiss the people who consume or\npropagate such information as irrational. In fact, given the experiences\nthey may have been having on the internet for many years ??? or what they\nmay have been encountering via traditional media for decades ??? their\nviews, troubling as they may be, may in many cases be perfectly rational.\n```\n\n[TransformExamples.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19493251/TransformExamples.pdf)", "Love it @wideaperture ??????\n\nIt's immediately thrown up stuff \uD83E\uDD73 For example, the excerpt from Evans and Ludgren's _No Heavenly Bodies_ includes some unwanted line breaks... I ran the command in my dev version of Zettlr and they're removed. Sadly, the text has some \"funky\" whitespace that confounds the existing transforms.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c7bff1e-a9f1-475d-a871-a6d8908ecc7b)\n\nThat \"whitespace\" is `SPACE` + `SOFT HYPHEN` ([?](https://www.ascii-code.com/CP1252/173)) + `SPACE`.\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74d612bf-92f4-4a11-ac2f-de86b75e4f54\n\nI'll leave it to you and Hendrik to decide _What_ to do here; perhaps there's a composite transform called `Zap Gremlins` that does a whole bunch of cleanup on a selected block of text:\n\n* remove unwanted line breaks\n* strip duplicate spaces\n* remove any soft hyphens, hairline spaces, that sort of thing\n* more?\n\nIn any case, GREAT! Having real data to work with is fantabulosa ??????", "Thank you, @richdouglasevans! I love the idea of a `Zap Gremlins` option. Another Zettlr-adjacent app, Scrivener, [seems to have this feature](https://forum.literatureandlatte.com/t/what-is-zap-gremlins/44999/2), so some users may already be familiar with it:\n\n> Text Tidying ??? Zap Gremlins Strips Unicode and ASCII control characters from the selection. If you are having difficulties compiling, or have found areas in your text where the cursor seems to get ???stuck??? when moving through ranges of text, your document may have acquired these invisible control characters from somewhere. This command will strip out all of the Unicode characters falling within the range of #x00 to #x1F, save for the necessary #x09, #x0A, #x0C and #X0D characters, which are used to print spaces, line returns, page breaks and tabs in your text.\n\nI haven't used Scrivener in something like 12 years, so I had no idea they had implemented this. It seems, in fact, like we've independently arrived at [nearly all the same features](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/clean-up-your-texts-with-scrivener):\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ecb032c-e896-4f17-a53d-f39ff569010c)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3869737-f59d-42d8-a3e8-dc77cd3813ff)\n\nI think the only (relevant, non-word processor-y) ones not on our list are `Zap Gremlins`, `Strip Leading Tabs/Spaces`, `Make Uppercase`, and `Make Lowercase`.", "@nathanlesage Any sense of when these features might be code-reviewed/merged?

However, I am very lost with regards to the various pull requests you opened, @richdouglasevans -- could you provide me with a sorted list in which order I should look at them? Then we can merge this soon and be done with this task.\n\nI'm at IC2S2 next week where I'm conference chair, however, so it'll be the week thereafter at the earliest.", "> However, I am very lost with regards to the various pull requests you opened, @richdouglasevans -- could you provide me with a sorted list in which order I should look at them?\n\nThere is just a single pull request (PR) which addresses exactly one of the proposed transforms:\n\n* #5701\n\nI have implemented all of the transforms _locally_ ??? the various videos showcasing the editor integration attest to that ??? but I have not raised PRs for them because:\n\n> I'm using this PR to both flush out the approach and learn any things about contributing to this codebase. If all goes well I'll implement the other text transforms secure in the knowledge that the approach has been signed-off by Hendrik (and others) and any \"dumb\" first-time contributor stuff is sorted.\n\nIn your comment on that PR you expressed a potential reservation about the approach taken; [you wrote](https://github.com/Zettlr/Zettlr/pull/5701#issuecomment-2772653913):\n\n> I'll have to think if it's really adequate to have the transform commands implemented using a factory style.\n\nThe other twelve or so transforms all use the exact same approach; I am loathe to raise twelve or more PRs only to receive a review comment along the lines of _\"This approach is inadequate.\"_ You know what I mean? :D\n\nMmm \uD83E\uDD14 What I'll do is raise exactly one more PR for another transform so that you can see how the approach works across two distinct transforms. I will action any review comments you leave and, hopefully, PRs for the remaining transforms will flow in quickly with (relatively) minimal review required because the approach has been signed-off.\n\nI'll raise that PR tomorrow and then reply to this conversation with a sorted list of exactly two PRs ??????", "Sounds good! Thanks for sticking with me, even if it took a while \uD83D\uDE48", "I've updated the single existing PR with another commit.\n\n* #5701\n\nI've done another commit as opposed to another PR because this work is still \"up in the air\" about the approach. The approach might be rubbish in which case deleting one PR and branch is easier than two PRs and two branches.\n\nFor the reviewer -- Hendrik I reckon \uD83D\uDE04 -- I suggest starting in the `transforms` directory: each transform is implemented in its own file. If we go ahead with this approach there will eventually be 12+ distinct transform files in this directory.\n\n<img width=\"377\" height=\"475\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e7e36fd-950e-4103-a9ee-24b0cb43d946\" />\n\n\nThe `transform-selected-text.ts` [file](https://github.com/Zettlr/Zettlr/pull/5701/commits/22720ecb402506888a02907f14727b2fa221962a#diff-c8b72e744c4ad2c580752e458bcf587e1990c8c8d87d5b0ef4d0bb0886ddcc88R39) contains the machinery for all these transforms: the `transformSelectedText` higher-order function accepts some transformation function -- it doesn't care what the specifics of the transformations are -- and it handles all the CodeMirror machinery.\n\nThis leaves the implementation for each transform free to focus on just doing the transform:\n\n* the `stripDuplicateSpaces` transform [is trivial](https://github.com/Zettlr/Zettlr/pull/5701/files#diff-f8e8885cfb2144e5180d7d5d6dfb15c4dcb19151b1e0cf2833a6281538246534R16): the JSDoc is longer than the implementation.\n* the `italicsToQuotes` [transform](https://github.com/Zettlr/Zettlr/pull/5701/files#diff-26c049ca247b0a5c20b97524cf86d333cf7a28ef5d727ade068ec5909cd80c09R16) is the most \"complicated\" transform which is why I chose to include it as the only other transform in this PR. It uses Hendrik's existing AST code in the implementation following a steer from Hendrik.\n\nThe other transforms are somewhere between these two in terms of implementation complexity.

In nereids, the key of partition prune is in `PartitionPruner.java`. you should read it and understand its details completely. the key function is `canBePrunedOut`.\n\n### Are you willing to submit PR?\n\n- [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct)\n",

However, I have some suggestions regarding modifications to partition pruning. \n\n1. For single-column partitions, we can simply use the column value itself as the partition identifier and apply the partitionPredicate to the partition identifier column during pruning. \n2. For multi-column partitions, we can use a `List<a, b, ...>` as the partition identifier, and during pruning, pass a corresponding `List<Pred1, Pred2, ...>`, using two nested for loops for pruning: the outer loop iterates over the partition identifier columns, and the inner loop applies the predicates Pred to each element of the partition identifier list. \n\nAnother question I have is whether the current design addresses this???When pruning for an SQL statement like `WHERE colA=xxx AND colB=xxx`, does the partitionPredicate passed in accurately match the columns used in partitioning, rather than passing all predicates from the SQL statement and comparing them one by one.", "please assign to me???I'ill try my best to complete it  :)" ],

Attached is a video of the bug in action, this becomes especially noticable when zooming in or out. I was able to recreate this also in the attached Stackblitz repos.\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74c06c5b-460d-40ef-b3f6-b16952947e20\n\n### Pull Request Link\n\n_No response_\n\n### Reason for not contributing a PR\n\n- [ ] Lack of time\n- [ ] Unsure how to implement the fix/feature\n- [ ] Difficulty understanding the codebase\n- [x] Other\n\n### Other Reason\n\nI am sadly not knowledgable enough to know how to correct this. I don't even know what causes this. If it helps I found a similar bug solved on a different component library: https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/pull/6097/files\n\n### Reproducer\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/github-ze9i24ka-z8m17tsk?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.html\n\n### Environment\n\nMy display resolution is 1920x1080 with a scale of 125%. Changing scale or resolution didn't do anything. However on my 4k screen the button seems to always have a centered inner circle.\n\n\n\n### Angular version\n\n19\n\n### PrimeNG version\n\nv19\n\n### Node version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Browser(s)\n\nMicrosoft Edge for Business Version 132.0.2957.140, Firefox 135.0\n\n### Steps to reproduce the behavior\n\n1. Go to https://primeng.org/radiobutton or provided Stackblitz repos\n2. Change preset to Material (this theme shows it the most obvious)\n3. Zoom in and out (ctrl + scroll), you should see the button not be centered anymore. \n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe button inner circle should stay centered.",

And offset of the inner circle from sides should be _(17.5px-10.5px)/2=3.5px_. When radio button is rendered, these values are rounded. Not sure how browsers decide whether to round up or down, but it may be inconsistent. E.g., I would expect the size of the outer circle to be either _17x17_ or _18x18_, but it is actually _18x17_. So, sometimes not only the inner circle is not centered, but the size of the circles is incorrect.\n\n#### Material theme\nHere sizes are specified in _px_. Outer circle size is _20px_, inner circle size is _10px_. This would work fine, but inner circle also has _\"transform: scale(1,1)\"_, which causes rounding errors in Firefox for some reason (but not in Chrome).

      "description" : "### System information\n\nTop of tree.\n\n### What is the problem that this feature solves?\n\nCurrently, ONNX???s `shape_inference.infer_shapes` API performs both type and shape inference simultaneously. Type inference is guaranteed in a valid model, but shape inference is on \"best effort\" basis. For some operators (e.g., GridSample, Gather, Reshape, Where, etc), shape inference may fail due to incomplete or complex shape logic, even when type inference could succeed. \nThis tight coupling prevents users from recovering type information when shape inference is unsupported or fails. For example, when users attempt to inject cast nodes or quantize nodes and propagate the type information downstream.\n\n\n**Request:**\nPlease consider adding an option to ONNX???s shape inference API to:\n- Run type inference independently of shape inference, so that type information can be propagated even when shape inference fails or is not implemented for an operator.\n- Alternatively, relax the requirement that shape inference must succeed for type inference to run.\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Enables users and downstream tools to recover and validate type information in more models, improving robustness and usability.\n- Reduces manual workarounds (such as manually setting types for affected nodes).\n- Makes ONNX models more portable and easier to analyze, even when shape logic is incomplete.\n\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n1. Create a separate function to support only type inference `infer_types` (preferable) \n2. Add boolean argument `check_shape=True` to the existing `infer_shapes` API (renaming the function is advisable in this case, `infer_shapes_and_types` or similar).\n\n\n### Describe the feature\n\nDecouple type inference from shape inference.\n\n\n### Will this influence the current api (Y/N)?\n\nDepends on the alternative selected. \nCan maintain backwards compatiblity.\n\n### Feature Area\n\nshape_inference\n\n### Are you willing to contribute it (Y/N)\n\nNone\n\n### Notes\n\nRelated issues https://github.com/onnx/onnx/issues/4934",

Any specific example to illustrate what you would like to see?\n\n@gramalingam Type inference is typically much simpler than shape inference, and less error-prone. \nShape inference may fail for dynamic shapes and for data-dependent shape scenarios, but type-inference is always very straight forward.\nI would like to be able to modify the input types for a graph and propagate the type information to the graph's outputs reliably.\nThe main consumer I have in mind is the newly release ModelOpt AutoCast tool ([Readme](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-Model-Optimizer/blob/main/docs/source/guides/8_autocast.rst\n)). Specifically, I'd like to avoid shape-related failures in this [pass](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-Model-Optimizer/blob/main/modelopt/onnx/autocast/precisionconverter.py#L178-L187). The shape inference failures are rare, and typically caused by model issues or wrong input shape, but I'd really like to be able to simplify this to handle only type-inference.\nRegardless, I think this is a long-standing anomaly that type inference and shape inference are coupled together.", "@galagam : conceptually, yes, having a separate type inference (without shape inference) could help, especially to bypass bugs in shape inference. Inference in ONNX involves both general inference logic, as well as operation-specific inference logic. Separating the type inference logic from shape inference logic in the operator-specific logic can be tedious work. If you have any suggestions on how to do that, would appreciate them.\n\nThe simplest approach I can see is to use the fact that the design allows for separate exceptions for type-inference errors and shape-inference errors. So, one possibility is that in the generic inference algorithm, we can catch shape-inference errors, and ignore them, and keep going ... this can be done [here](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/88d94b88fefffa98bc74cbae6fa63798d0d9c9f5/onnx/shape_inference/implementation.cc#L515) I think.", "BTW, have you tried setting `strict_mode=False` ? May give a partial workaround. If we don't want to update the operator specific inference method for every op, one possible approach might be to extend this flag setting (see [here](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/7c3b330981e3ba371eaaeb8250c3379636c8fa97/onnx/defs/shape_inference.h#L27)) to have one setting to suppress shape-inference errors, but report type-inference errors.", "@gramalingam \n\n> BTW, have you tried setting strict_mode=False ? May give a partial workaround.\n\nAFAICT setting `strict_mode=False` just allows shape inference to silently fail instead of throwing an exception. This is not effective in this scenario. \n\n> one possible approach might be to extend this flag setting (see [here](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/7c3b330981e3ba371eaaeb8250c3379636c8fa97/onnx/defs/shape_inference.h#L27)) to have one setting to suppress shape-inference errors, but report type-inference errors.\n\nExtending the flag setting is an interesting idea - I did not consider this. I saw you also suggested this on #7154 . I think it's worth exploring.\n\n> Separating the type inference logic from shape inference logic in the operator-specific logic can be tedious work. If you have any suggestions on how to do that, would appreciate them.\n\nAssuming the above suggestion falls through, and we go for modifying all ops instead, we can probably harness code generating AI agents (such as Cursor or Windsurf) for this task. It's tedious, but very straightforward, which is exactly the kind of tasks these tools excel at. We just need to be clear on the design and backwards compatibility. \nThat is: \n- We can only update defs.cc, never old.cc, right? \n- Does it mean we create a new version for every single op with this change?\n- What happens if user calls `infer_types` but the node does not have `infer_types` defined (older opset or any other reason)? I'd suggest fall back on infer_shapes, but I'm not sure it's the best approach because it can have unexpected side effects.\nIn any case, I suggest we keep an pin in that and explore extending `error_mode` first.", "Ok, another simplification is possible. There is already a generic type-inference mechanism (that does not rely on the operator-specific inference-method), which works fine for most operators ... it uses the type-annotation attached to inputs and outputs in the operator schema. See the implementation [here](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/ee724f6635ed6c1e81890c9f120ac360000c5370/onnx/defs/schema.cc#L110) and it is called from the general inference [here](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/ee724f6635ed6c1e81890c9f120ac360000c5370/onnx/shape_inference/implementation.cc#L482)\n\nIt is incomplete for special cases for operators where the output type is dependent on an attribute value etc.: like Cast or Constant.\n\nSo, it should be sufficient if we implement the type-inference logic only for these handful of operators where the type-annotation is insufficient." ],

So from my prespective this issue must be close, or if you had something else in mind please  be more specific.\n\n<img width=\"908\" height=\"436\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a04dfe50-665a-4805-bf61-cd99dedd691f\" />", "@ThiloteE Can you give guidance here?\n\n@SalvadorRomo I think, it was also at the preferences somewhat ", "When you run a (local) model using an inference engine that is compatible with the OpenAI API and you therefore choose to run it in JabRef via the OpenAI AI provider dropdown in the preferences, it will say it is running an OpenAI model, while not necessarily being true. This is the reason for the rename. Ideally, we should split up \"OpenAI\" and \"OpenAI compatible API\" into seperate dropdowns, but since that would require more coding work, this issue here exists. The issue should definitely not be closed.\n\nHere is an example of me running a [qwen3-14B model](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3-14B-GGUF) (which is NOT from OpenAI) via [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) and as you can see the current development version of JabRef claims it is a model from OpenAI (which is not true):\n\n<img width=\"1089\" height=\"723\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3f61c4f-3823-4f18-9e67-500843ccfb0d\" />\n\n<img width=\"1668\" height=\"410\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f401789b-56ff-4f49-abf3-7796e95923b3\" />\n\n<img width=\"1664\" height=\"408\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c4223e4-61d5-446d-a3d6-d76424a22599\" />", "How about we just remove the provider name from processing and only mention the model name? Hmm. But we would be lying, if the (pre and post) processing was done by an ensemble of models, not just one. Then it would be a \"service\" by the AI provider. Not just a model.", "@SalvadorRomo I meant to rename the provider name in \"Provider\" combobox \uD83D\uDE06 \n\\+ check out `AiProvider`\n\\+ track where provider names are displayed, so that we won't have a problem that Thilo has shared on screenshot with loading dialog\n\nSorry, should've written a better issue description", "Hey sorry for the delay, i just changed from computer and I'm reconfiguring the project again but ran into this issue \n\n<img width=\"953\" height=\"200\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/406e55c8-d154-41db-8102-129a811c5778\" />  seems sonatype server is down from yesterdey, have this issue happened to you?

The limiation are currently that it is not possible to create new keywords/tags directly in the field like you could with select2. The `SelectTagify` class does not have any \"#autocreate' capabilities. This would be something we need to look into more and possibly override to get the behavior we are looking for.

Interesting idea to gate the panics on `target_pointer_width`, although really we want the panic only when it's *less than* 64 rather than when it's *not equal to*. Maybe this is impossible to do. In that case I guess we can just special-case the specific values \"32\" and \"64\" which will be the overwhelmingly most common ones. Or not bother. This is just an optimization, and a compile-time one at that.", "I spotted there is something in the code doing a similar job. For example for converting from `usize` there is a a code in `/internals/lib.rs`:\n\n```rust\npub trait ToU64 {\n    /// Converts unsigned integer type to a [`u64`].\n    fn to_u64(self) -> u64;\n}\n\nmacro_rules! impl_to_u64 {\n    ($($ty:ident),*) => {\n        $(\n            impl ToU64 for $ty { fn to_u64(self) -> u64 { self.into() } }\n        )*\n    }\n}\nimpl_to_u64!(u8, u16, u32, u64);\n\nimpl ToU64 for usize {\n    fn to_u64(self) -> u64 {\n        crate::const_assert!(\n            core::mem::size_of::<usize>() <= 8;\n            \"platforms that have usize larger than 64 bits are not supported\"\n        );\n        self as u64\n    }\n}\n```\n\nhas anyone seen this when creating the issue? Should we continue rewriting into a new way (const module) or expand on the existing solution for other sizes?", "`ToU64` is about dealing with `usize` not having a fixed size. It is not about casts that are well-defined and guaranteed to be correct.\n\n`ToU64` is also part of the public API. const casts should not be." ],

See for example the [April 26 sig-node meeting notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ne57gvidMEWXR70OxxnRkYquAoMpt56o75oZtg-OeBg/edit#heading=h.d9zp2j5jvkke) and the [April 27 sig-node CI subgroup meeting notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fb-ugvgdSVIkkuJ388_nhp2pBTy_4HEVg5848Xy7n5U/edit#heading=h.2v8vzknys4nk).\r\n\r\nThis work has already begun and there are already some PR posted (see: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108024#pullrequestreview-954083698). This is a great start. There are more areas in the kubelet, especially in the container manager and resource manager area, that can use better unit test coverage.\r\n\r\nBesides the obvious benefits of documenting and preserving the current behaviour, adding tests is meant to lower the barrier for future work and contributions.\r\n\r\nExamples of some areas which can benefit of more tests:\r\n\r\n- k/k/pkg/kubelet/cm/internal_container_lifecycle.go\r\n- k/k/pkg/kubelet/cm/internal_container_lifecycle_linux.go\r\n- k/k/pkg/kubelet/cm/pod_container_manager_linux.go\r\n- k/k/pkg/kubelet/cm/qos_container_manager_linux.go\r\n- everything coverage-driven (check [test code coverage](https://go.dev/blog/cover) and build from there)\r\n- error paths in general\r\n-  e2e tests in general",

In its simplest form, it would look like this in a struct:\r\n\r\n`fn __divmod__(self: Self, other: Self) -> Tuple[Self, Self]`\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is your motivation for this change?\r\n\r\nEach dunder method has its own trait. We should do it for `__divmod__` too. \r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/modularml/mojo/pull/2097#discussion_r1591144433\r\n\r\n\r\n### Any other details?\r\n\r\nWhile trying to implement it, I encountered a blocking error.

      "comments" : [ "Hi!\n\nI'm quite surprised that you reached the limits of Kafka by collecting events with OpenWEC. Out of curiosity, could you share an estimate of how many machines you are collecting events from and what your traffic is like (e.g. number of events, byte rate)?\n\nI don't understand how increasing the number of topics would improve performance (except if you have only one partition per topic). Could you share a documentation or an article stating about that? \n\nI would rather suggest to:\n- increase the number of partitions in your topic\n- increase the number of nodes in the Kafka cluster (at least one partition per node)\n- improve the storage technology used to store Kafka partitions (SSD)\n- tweak producer(s) configuration (batch size for example)\n- tweak consumer(s) configuration\n- tweak topic configuration (e.g. partition size, partition retention time)\n\n", "Hi! I am from Brian's team. We have 100k+ workstations and ~5500 servers that we going to collect from. \n\nIf there is a substantially huge volume on one single topic, it fills up the disk unevenly on a Kafka cluster.  This makes the team go into maintenance mode, rebalancing partitions which is tedious, sometimes error prone and time consuming all while hoping we don't miss realtime logs. So we have retention time and retention bytes applied to the partition. This keeps the busy work from us. But this means we need to monitor the volume and split the topic into more as they reach a certain level otherwise retention time criteria is not met.\nOur consumers scaling logic is shared across all log sources including wef. They all(300+) scale for up to 24 partitions so we don't have to handle scaling on case by case basis.\n\nSo we keep it fixed to 24 and make new topics if we reach more volume(message/sec) or more size(bytes/sec) than a number.\n\nLong story short, one could use 100s of partitions in Kafka on single topic if we are building a new system just to process windows events but after having tuned all other bits and pieces of the system, an ability to load balance across topics would make our life easier.\n\nForwarders like winlogbeats, logstash, etc. provide some sort of scripting and variable name for topic etc.. that we use to split volume to multiple topics. Does openwec has similar capability? Hoping we could work around.", "Thanks for the explanations! I'm very interested in knowing how you deployed OpenWEC and how it behaves with that type of charge. \n\n> Does openwec has similar capability?\n\nWe don't have that feature yet.\n\nAs you mentioned, if the Kafka driver configuration contains multiple topics, the expected behavior is for the received events to be distributed fairly among the configured topics. This behavior does not seem to be implemented in the Kafka producer library itself, so we need to implement it ourselves. However, the Kafka producer library can send each message (e.g., a Windows event) to a different topic.\n\nCurrently, the Kafka driver is stateless. This means that we cannot use a \"global\" round-robin index to fairly rotate between topics without making significant changes to the Kafka driver logic and possibly impacting performance. The Kafka driver, however, receives a batch of events to send in a single \"write\" call (https://github.com/cea-sec/openwec/blob/main/server/src/drivers/kafka.rs#L84). Therefore, I think we can use a \"local\" round-robin index to achieve relative fairness. The idea is to start at a random position in the topics array and iterate through the array for each event.\n\nI prefer your second proposal of adding a \"topics\" parameter to the Kafka driver configuration that contains a pre-made topics list. This approach seems much easier to understand and less likely to be used incorrectly. Additionally, if both \"topics\" and \"topic\" are present, an error should be raised.\n\nDoes this approach feel reasonable to you? It does not seem difficult to implement. Would you be interested in implementing it?", "Yes that would be perfect", "\"Would you be interested in implementing it?\" If you mean, would we be able to deploy and test in our environment; then yes, we can validate feature runs in a large-scale environment.

Careful review and test isolation checks will be necessary after refactoring.\n\n**Additional Notes**\n\nRefer to Django???s documentation on [setUpTestData](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/topics/testing/tools/#django.test.TestCase.setUpTestData) for best practices.

      "description" : "# Logical Hadamard Transition\r\n\r\nThe logical Hadamard transition allows X(Z) type correlation surface to be changed to Z(X) type either in space or time. The necessary ingredients to implement the feature is ready in the codebase and it should  be a good starting point for the new contributors to get themselves familiar with the project.\r\n\r\n## 1. Temporal Hadamard Transition\r\n\r\n### 1.1 Construction\r\n\r\nThe temporal Hadamard transition is simply a transversal layer of H gates applied to all data qubits. Note that the boundary conditions of the code patches before and after the transition are flipped, meaning the X(Z) boundary changes to Z(X), and the stabilizer types of the patch are also inverted.\r\n\r\n![??????](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc51a86a-1920-41d5-a23c-1da5cd0ce2cc)\r\n\r\n\r\n### 1.2 Example\r\n\r\nYou can create a minimal example of a computation that includes the temporal Hadamard transition:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom tqec import BlockGraph, Cube, Position3D, ZXCube, SignedDirection3D, Direction3D\r\n\r\ng = BlockGraph()\r\ng.add_edge(\r\n    Cube(Position3D(0, 0, 0), ZXCube.from_str(\"ZXZ\")),\r\n    Cube(Position3D(0, 0, 1), ZXCube.from_str(\"XZX\")),\r\n)\r\ncorrelation_surfaces = g.to_zx_graph().find_correration_surfaces()\r\ng.view_as_html(\r\n    pop_faces_at_direction=SignedDirection3D(Direction3D.Y, False),\r\n    show_correlation_surface=correlation_surfaces[0],\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n![Temporal Logical Hadamard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68a2ac7a-b064-4da5-babb-a245734b4246)\r\n\r\n\r\n## 2. Spatial Hadamard Transition\r\n\r\n### 2.1 Construction\r\n\r\nThe spatial Hadamard transition is more complex. It involves replacing plaquettes on the boundaries of connected cubes. Specifically, new plaquettes measuring `ZXZX` and `XZXZ` stabilizers must be introduced at the boundary.\r\n\r\n![??????](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d80ba83f-6d1d-4283-8707-00946ddcd5b0)\r\n\r\n\r\n### 2.2 Example\r\n\r\nYou can create a minimal example of a computation that includes the spatial Hadamard transition with the following code:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom tqec import BlockGraph, Cube, Position3D, ZXCube, SignedDirection3D, Direction3D\r\n\r\ng = BlockGraph()\r\ng.add_edge(\r\n    Cube(Position3D(0, 0, 0), ZXCube.from_str(\"ZXZ\")),\r\n    Cube(Position3D(1, 0, 0), ZXCube.from_str(\"XZX\")),\r\n)\r\ncorrelation_surfaces = g.to_zx_graph().find_correration_surfaces()\r\ng.view_as_html(\r\n    pop_faces_at_direction=SignedDirection3D(Direction3D.Y, False),\r\n    show_correlation_surface=correlation_surfaces[0],\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n![Spatial Logical Hadamard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d0bc6fe-345f-4cf9-8dd6-46667a07d47b)\r\n\r\n## 3. Implementation\r\n\r\nTo implement this feature, consider starting with the CSS-type surface code, which has a simpler circuit. The main changes will be in `src/tqec/compile/specs/library/_utils` particularly in the `default_substitution_builder` function. You will need to create new plaquettes that support the transition; existing plaquette builders can be found in `src/tqec/plaquette/library`, which you may modify as needed.\r\n\r\nRegarding of temporal transition, there is an issue I'm aware of: if you implement a plaquette with a layer of H gates at the end of the circuit, i.e. after the measurements, then it will break the condition used by detector automation that there are no gates between measurements and resets. However, if you insert a layer of H gates before the measurements or after the resets, it will break the schedule of the circuits. @nelimee any idea on that? It seems reasonable to me that we should make some changes on the detector automation side to tolerate such cases.\r\n\r\nFor the boundary plaquette circuits that implement spatial transition, please refer to the figure above which includes both the stabilizer configuration and CNOTs order.  If further guidance is needed, I can provide sample circuits in [crumble](https://algassert.com/crumble).\r\n\r\nTesting the implementation can be done using the example code above to generate a `BlockGraph`. Use the compilation pipeline from the README to create stim circuits, which you can then verify in Crumble.\r\n\r\nThese are just my initial thoughts on the issue; there may be some details I haven???t covered. If you run into any problems, please feel free to reach out here or via email :-)\r\n",

It seems reasonable to me that we should make some changes on the detector automation side to tolerate such cases.\r\n\r\nThere are two major issues here that I would like to discuss in the future (and probably not here):\r\n\r\n1. There are a few \"things\" in the code that are hard-coded and require to match across several places right now. `Plaquettes` instances needing to be hand-made for each template (because each template might have its own plaquette indexing), template instantiation indices on the spatial boundaries, plaquette scheduling, and I am pretty sure that there are a few more things. We should think about whether this is fine for us, or if we should make that less manual / error-prone. I will open an issue on that soon.\r\n2. The detector computation part could very much be improved. It is lacking tests, it is not really performant, we might even benefit from more features (i.e., being able to only compute detectors involving at least one measurement from a given set of measurements instead of computing all the detectors and filtering them afterwards). #378 might be a good start. I will also open the issues (or discussions) I have in mind about that soon.", "Please, add SignedDirection3D, Direction3D to ??from tqec import BlockGraph, Cube, Position3D, ZXCube?? to make it easier to run for beginners as me :)", "> Please, add SignedDirection3D, Direction3D to ??from tqec import BlockGraph, Cube, Position3D, ZXCube?? to make it easier to run for beginners as me :)\r\n\r\nThank you for the reminder!

The option is available within the user's workspace management menu.\n\n### Expected behavior\nA new configuration setting should be introduced to allow administrators to disable workspace creation for non-admin users. This could be implemented either as an environment variable for the instance or as an option within the admin setup GUI.\n\nWhen this setting is enabled:\n* Only users with the 'admin' role will see the UI elements for creating a new workspace.\n* For all other non-admin users, these UI elements will be hidden.",

This couldn't really be at the Role level because a role is created in the context of a workspace while the workspace creation happens in a non logged-in state.\nThe only quick alternative is to introduce a system-wide environment variable like `IS_SIGNUP_DISABLED` that you would only toggle on temporarily when you need to switch a workspace (but anyone would still be able to do it)", "I'm also interested this feature. Would this be something that can be implemented? An env var that will prevent anonymous users from creating workspaces...? IMO the ability to prevent anonymous users from creating workspaces from the login screen would be a great initial value add...and then the role level control could be considered/added to complete the feature.", "This feature is especially useful in self-hosted scenarios, where we want to keep control of created workspaces (as one might need to configure them, and you have no access to workspaces created by other users unless invited or impersonating). As mentioned, I view this as a new environment variable that enables workspace creation only by the superuser.", "OK so it could be something like `IS_WORKSPACE_CREATION_LIMITED_TO_WORKSPACE_ADMINS` (default `false` and ignored if no workspace exists yet).\n\nIt shouldn't be too difficult to implement, I'll let anyone who wants take a stab!" ],

Please describe\n\nThe `SearchStats.Stats` [class](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/blob/main/server/src/main/java/org/opensearch/index/search/stats/SearchStats.java), which is a public API, currently uses a constructor that accepts a long list of all the statistics it tracks. This design has a significant drawback: adding any new statistic requires modifying the constructor. Since this is a public API, any such modification is a breaking change for users of the library.\n\nThis makes it difficult to add new metrics and evolve the API without causing significant disruption for developers who have adopted it. Each new stat forces a major version bump and requires users to update their code, even if they don't need the new metric.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nTo resolve this, I propose refactoring the `SearchStats.Stats` class to use a builder pattern. This would involve:\n\n1. Creating a Builder inner class within SearchStats.Stats.\n2. The Builder class would have setter methods for each statistic \n3. A build() method in the Builder would construct the SearchStats.Stats object.\n4. The existing constructor would be on deprecation path in 3.x and eventually made private in OpenSearch 4.0 since this will be a breaking change.\n\nIn OpenSearch 3.x, the existing constructor can continue to exist so as not to disrupt any depending plugins or otherwise.\n\n\n\n### Related component\n\nLibraries\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nHaving setter methods for new stats or existing stats risks the immutability of the object.\n\n### Additional context\n\nIdentified as part of adding new search metrics: https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/pull/18707 where backward compatibility is failing because of this.",

The docs website might be a bit (or more) outdated, and we'd appreciate contributions to keep it up-to-date.\n\nWhile we still support direct deployment on the host, we recommend Docker-based deployment as the main way to install Photoview, as it gives perfect abstraction and unification across host OS and architectures. Nothing is ideal, but the Docker deployment is easier to maintain, so the direct deployment on the host is considered an advanced way for users, skilled and ready to solve some dependency and configuration issues, caused by their OS and architecture differences and nuances.", "Thanks for the quick reply, I really appreciate that you took the time to write to me in addition to volunteering to make this project a reality. I've setup \"Dockage\" partly to learn another tool, partly to speed things up by skipping some of the docker-specific commandline. Some of my issues with the timeline were simply filesystem permissions on the host as it turns out, which is a bit embarassing to overlook. However, after resolving the permissions, it also took renaming the folders to get PhotoView to re-synchronize the timeline and eliminate blank images in it. It's working as expected now! \n\nThank you again for the time and effort you put into this completely free and life improving software!\n\nTmanok", "Yes, I know that setting proper permissions for Photoview on the host FS level might not be so straightforward and clear for some of our users. I tried to describe the permission requirements as detailed as I was able to, providing alternative ways to make it work (creating a user with the same UID and GID or giving a read permission to everyone). However, I understand that this might still cause some misunderstanding.\n\n> it also took renaming the folders to get PhotoView to re-synchronize the timeline and eliminate blank images in it\n\nI didn't get this part: which folders did you have to rename? As far as I remember, if some media files fail to be scanned and appear with blank thumbnails, they should be scanned again by the following scan job run until they are successfully scanned or removed from the media library folder. So, in your case, once you fixed your host FS permissions, you just need to run the scan job again from the Settings page, and after it is finished, those files should appear with their thumbnails on the Timeline.", "Hi @kkovaletp, \n\nThe media folders containing individual albums of photos needed to be renamed to be re-scanned properly. It was very strange but because the permissions were wonky and I hadn't noticed (uploaded with wrong user, didn't give read permission to everyone rw- r-- ---) PhotoView couldn't read the files, but could list them so blank thumbnails appeared and incomplete albums were present. After changing the permissions, forcing a sync for all photos owned by my user (the only application user in PhotoView), it did not update the files. Eventually, weeks later when I had time again, I decided to try simply renaming the folders containing those broken images and voila it rescanned them properly. \n\nIt seems like PhotoView is very good at detecting new media, but sometimes it might be sticky about old media. Fortunately, it doesn't retain things that have been deleted. Admittedly, I wish I could delete photos right in the web-application instead of on the filesystem (sometimes I find duplicates after I upload to PhotoView and it's my publication server for family photos, not my archive or source of truth storage). \n\nThanks again for your help and time contributing to the project. I'll leave the \"issue\" open until your next reply just in case you want me to help replicate the behaviour I described. \n\n\nTmanok" ],

This may lead to situations where e.g. in PRs the CI are green, but new flaky tests get introduced, or existing tests got more flaky.\n\n## Goal\n\nTo avoid this we should increase visibility of flaky tests in PRs to make the author and reviewer more aware and ask them to check whether their PR contributes to the flakiness (and fix that if so). This could be done e.g. with in-place updated PRs comment(s) for flaky tests like demonstrated in https://github.com/camunda/camunda/pull/28834\n\nWe should aim to keep noise as low as possible.\n\n",

The mechanism to use/update comments is just listed as an example, alternatives are possible and if you want to explore/compare them that is perfect.\n\n> Strict PR Blocking on Flakiness\n\nI'd say on \"new\" flakiness/flaky tests, to avoid introducing more ??? with such a hurdle we'd naturally decrease flakiness caused by code changes in the overall system.\n\n> Maybe flag as ???new??? flaky tests (requires historical tracking)\n\nWe have that kind of historical info present via [CI Health metrics](https://github.com/camunda/camunda/wiki/CI-&-Automation#flaky-tests) already, so this is definitely something worth looking into.\n\n> Also a question, currently do we differentiate flaky vs broken tests?\n\nYes, the naming used [on this dashboard](https://dashboard.int.camunda.com/d/ae2j69npxh3b4f/flaky-tests-camunda-camunda-monorepo) is on \"flaky\" (successful on retries) vs \"failing\" (not successful even after several retries) tests.

Implement Comment-Based Feedback (Baseline)\n- [x] Add `peter-evans/find-comment@v3` step.\n- [x] Add `peter-evans/create-or-update-comment@v4` step.\n- [x] Format the comment body using **markdown**, with clear, helpful context and summary of flaky tests.\n- [x] Test this on a **sample PR** with **forced flaky output** to validate functionality and formatting.\n\n### 3. Explore GitHub Checks as an Alternative (Optional / Parallel)\n- [x] Evaluate using **GitHub Checks API** for displaying flaky test information.\n- [x] Reference: [Using GitHub Checks for Test Feedback](https://josh-ops.com/posts/using-github-checks-api/)\n- [x] Compare against the comment-based approach:\n  - Visibility\n  - UX for developers\n  - Integration complexity\n- [x] (Optional) Provide both implementations or document trade-offs in the ticket/PR.\n\n### 4. Plan for Strict PR Blocking on New Flakiness (Future Scope)\n- [ ] Consider blocking PRs that introduce **new flaky tests** (not existing ones).\n- [ ] Flag **???new??? flaky tests** using historical data from CI Health metrics.\n\n", "**Recap and Next Steps**\n\nHere's a quick recap of where we are and what the plan looks like moving forward:\n\n\uD83D\uDD0D Summary of the Discussion\n- We've been exploring how to guide PR authors when flaky tests are detected.\n- The current approach is intentionally non-blocking, aiming to observe how engineers respond before enforcing stricter policies.\n- A key point raised was that messages containing ???if you have time??? phrasing, might lead engineers to dismiss the warning, even if their PR could have introduced the flakiness.\n- There's consensus that we should ask authors to assess whether their change could be related to the flaky test \n- There's also awareness that flaky tests can arise even without directly touching test-related code, so context is key.\n\n\uD83E\uDDED Planning Ahead\nTo ensure we strike the right balance between signal and noise, and avoid jumping to premature enforcement. I decided to take an incremental and feedback-driven approach:\n\n??? **Current state:** Informational comments will be available, without blocking.\n\n??? **Observation period:** Over the next month, I will monitor how engineers interact with these comments, and start a thread at the end of the period to everyone bring their insights.\n\n\uD83D\uDD01 **Re-evaluation:** Based on that feedback, we???ll decide whether to:\n\n- Enforce blocking for new flaky tests,\n- Keep messaging as-is,\n- Highlight newly introduced flakiness & easily direct user to files with flaky tests \n- Or explore other options\n\nI've already set a reminder for next month to revisit this thread and assess how it???s going. \n~For now, I???ll keep this task open, since we still have an [ongoing discussion about the noisy caused by the comments.](https://github.com/camunda/camunda/pull/35780#issuecomment-3117863746)~\nAfter internal alignment, we've decided to take this [other approach](https://github.com/camunda/camunda/pull/35780#issuecomment-3127753493), although the overall plan described above remains unchanged.\n\nThanks again, @cmur2 and @maxdanilov, for your support and for the insightful discussions!\n\n" ],

User taps on a chat icon in the app\n2. A modal/chat screen opens\n3. User types a question or news-related prompt\n4. Chatbot responds using the Gemini API\n5. Past conversations can optionally be stored locally or in Firestore\n\n---\n\n**Tech Stack**\n- Dart / Flutter\n- flutter_bloc for state management\n- Gemini API via HTTP\n\n---\n\n**UI Ideas**\n- Floating Action Button ??? Chat Overlay\n- Chat bubble layout (like WhatsApp/Messenger)\n- Show loading shimmer while bot \"thinks\"\n- Support image/news link previews in chat\n\n---\n\n**Why Me?**\nI'm a GSSoC contributor excited about Flutter, NLP, and building helpful AI tools. I'd love to implement the first version of this chatbot and iterate based on mentor feedback.\n\nPlease assign this issue to me.\n",

      "description" : "### Describe the feature in detail (code, mocks, or screenshots encouraged)\n\nBuilding off of https://github.com/skeletonlabs/skeleton/issues/3588\n\nWe should aim to do a pass through the Skeleton components that implement `btn-icon` and ensure these have the appropriate props to set both the `title` and `aria-label` attribute per each. Additionally, each prop should contain a default value. The idea is these labels should describe the action in as succinct a manner possible in English. But given they are a prop so they can modified as needed for i18n purposes.\n\n### How to Update\n\nSetting up a new component props has a few steps:\n\n> NOTE: remember to keep both the Svelte (.svelte) and React (.tsx) components in sync\n\n1. Add an optional prop to the component's respective `types.ts` file\n2. Add a semantic JSDoc description for each prop in `types.ts`\n3. Register the new prop in the component and set a default value\n4. Add the prop to the template for each icon button\n\nWe do no have a naming convention for `title` or `aria-label` attributes at present, but we should be able to keep these similar to [style prop conventions](https://www.skeleton.dev/docs/resources/contribute/components#style-prop-conventions):\n\n- If the icon button is the root element -> no prefix needed\n- If the icon button is a child element -> prefix as `fooTitle` and `fooAriaLabel`\n\nWhere `foo` represents the semantic prefix name already in use for class props, derived from Zag's spread methods, or if need be a new semantic name can be implemented.\n\n### Attribute Presets\n\nPer the attribute values themselves, remember they should describe the purpose of the button, not just summarize the icon, especially the `aria-label` for screen reader users.\n\n- BAD: `title=\"Arrow\"` -> this does not describe the purpose of the button\n- GOOD: `title=\"Submit\"` -> this is a good and semantic description of the button\n\n### What type of pull request would this be?\n\nEnhancement\n\n### Provide relevant links or additional information.\n\nThe following components were reported to make use of the `btn-icon` class in .svelte/.tsx files, but I'd welcome a new dedicated audit to confirm.\n\n> NOTE the component is the focus of this request, maintaining the playground is optional (but welcome)\n\n```\n- packages/skeleton-svelte/src/components/Toast/Toaster.svelte\n- playgrounds/skeleton-svelte/src/routes/components/app-bars/+page.svelte\n- playgrounds/skeleton-svelte/src/routes/components/popover/+page.svelte\n- packages/skeleton-react/src/components/Toast/Toaster.tsx\n- sites/themes.skeleton.dev/src/lib/components/common/Lightswitch/Lightswitch.svelte\n- sites/themes.skeleton.dev/src/lib/components/generator/Controls/Controls.svelte\n- playgrounds/skeleton-react/src/app/components/app-bar/page.tsx\n- sites/skeleton.dev/src/components/homepage/HomeCompGrid.svelte\n- sites/skeleton.dev/src/examples/guides/cookbook/stepper/Example.svelte\n- sites/skeleton.dev/src/examples/components/popover/ExamplePopover.tsx\n- sites/skeleton.dev/src/examples/components/popover/ExamplePopover.svelte\n```",

      "description" : "**Describe the bug**\nThis is something I've picked up on the kube-vip's Slack. It seems (if I understand the code correctly) that if DHCP is being used and kube-vip is unable (for some reason) to get the IP address from the DHCP server it will only try to do so 3 times in a row (with backing off counter, for a minute) and if it will be unable to get address it will kill the DHCP client and do nothing at all.\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n\nI am not really sure yet. Maybe start kube-vip within an environment with no DHCP server/DHCP server blocked with firewall?\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\n1. DHCP client should still try to get the IP or should kill the kube-vip's pod and emit an error (?)\n2. DHCP configuration (number of attempts, timeout etc.) should be configurable.\n\n\n**Additional context**\n\n```\n2025/06/20 11:58:36 INFO creating new macvlan interface for DHCP interface=vip-97a8bd4e\n2025/06/20 11:58:36 INFO Generated mac address=00:00:6C:5b:43:b5\n2025/06/20 11:58:36 INFO new macvlan interface interface=vip-97a8bd4e \"hardware address\"=\"\\x00\\x00l[C\\xb5\"\n2025/06/20 11:58:50 INFO [UPNP] Refreshing Instances \"number of instances\"=0\n2025/06/20 11:59:11 ERROR request failed err=\"unable to receive an offer: got an error while the discovery request: no matching response packet received\" waiting=10s\n2025/06/20 11:59:56 ERROR request failed err=\"unable to receive an offer: got an error while the discovery request: no matching response packet received\" waiting=19.614284255s\n2025/06/20 12:00:51 ERROR failed to get an IP address after 3 attempts, error unable to receive an offer: got an error while the discovery request: no matching response packet received, giving up\n2025/06/20 12:00:51 ERROR error starting DHCP for kube-system/nginx-dhcp: error: failed to get an IP address after 3 attempts, error unable to receive an offer: got an error while the discovery request: no matching response packet received, giving up\n2025/06/20 12:03:50 INFO [UPNP] Refreshing Instances \"number of instances\"=0\n2025/06/20 12:08:50 INFO [UPNP] Refreshing Instances \"number of instances\"=0\n```\n\nThis might be a good first isse for a person who understands a bit of concurrency in Go.

The issue has a clear, reproducible problem: the search API key gets wiped out whenever settings are saved, even when modifying unrelated configuration like LLM provider settings.\n\n**What's clear from the report:**\nThe reproduction steps are well-defined - add a search API key, change any other setting, save, and the API key disappears. This suggests a classic form handling issue where either the search API key field isn't being properly included in the save operation, or there's a state management problem where the key gets overwritten during the settings update process.\n\n**Technical factors to consider:**\nThis is likely a UI/UX issue in the settings form logic. The problem could stem from a few common patterns - maybe the form is only serializing visible or \"dirty\" fields, or there's separate state management for different setting categories that aren't being merged properly. It could also be a simple oversight where the search API key field isn't included in the save payload.\n\n**What needs investigation:**\nYou'll want to examine the settings form component and trace through the save flow. Check how form data is collected, whether all fields are being included in the request, and how the backend processes the settings update. Look at the network requests when saving to see if the API key is even being sent.\n\n**Next steps:**\nStart by reproducing the issue locally, then inspect the settings save functionality in the frontend code. Check the form serialization logic and the API call that handles settings updates. This feels like the kind of bug where the fix might be adding a single field to a form data object or ensuring proper state merging.", "I'm on it! mamoodi can [track my progress at all-hands.dev](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/cd964620c9db45c08a0a4241c0e73aa4)", "@mamoodi is this still an issue?

      "description" : "### GitHub Username\n\nkyra-1\n\n### \uD83D\uDCCC Issue Title / Suggestion Summary\n\nBug: Password complexity rules are suggested by the UI but not enforced during registration\n\n### \uD83D\uDCDD Detailed Description\n\n## \uD83D\uDD0D What is the Current Behavior?\n\nThe current registration form (`register.html`) includes a **password strength bar** that visually represents the complexity of the password.  \nIt evaluates the following criteria:\n\n- Password **length**\n- Presence of **uppercase letters**\n- Inclusion of **numbers**\n- Usage of **special characters**\n\nBased on these, the bar changes **width** and **color** to indicate strength.  \nHowever, the form submission handler only validates the password's length (must be 8-20 characters) and that the confirmation matches.\n\n---\n\n## \uD83D\uDCA1 What Change Are You Proposing?    \n\nThe current registration form has a bug where it allows the submission of weak passwords like \"aaaaaaaa\". The password strength meter provides visual feedback on complexity by checking for uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters, but these rules are not actually enforced when the user clicks \"Register\". I am proposing a change to fix this by ensuring the password complexity rules are mandatory for successful registration.   \n\n---\n\n## \uD83C\uDFAF Why Is This Needed?\n\nThis is a functional bug that allows users to create weak and insecure passwords, defeating the purpose of having a password strength indicator and creating a security loophole in the registration process.\n\n## \uD83D\uDCAD Proposed Solution \n\nThe solution involves modifying the form submission handler within the register.js file. The validation logic that runs upon form submission will be updated to incorporate the complexity checks already used by the visual strength meter. If the password does not meet these required criteria, the submission will be blocked and an appropriate error message will be displayed to the user.\n\nI???ve reviewed the relevant files and am ready to begin. Please assign this issue to me if approved.\n\n---\n\n## ??? Readiness and Request\n\nI have reviewed the relevant files and am fully prepared to begin implementing this feature.\n\nIf this proposal is approved, I would appreciate being **assigned this issue** so I can start contributing to the improvement.\n\n\n### ???

For example, a user with the zh_CN locale would expect the Chinese date format, not a globally set server format. So it???s probably better to detect the user???s locale from their device or IP.  I'll have to check how others handled this when locale is changed...\n\nWe already have this functionality in dev mode for the user panel, which converts date/time based on the browser locale:\n<img width=\"384\" height=\"104\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51eae2f5-948c-4632-956b-d8303dc57924\" />\n\nIt's not perfect: for me, it shows Chrome's default *en_US* format even though I'm in Europe.\n\nBut it???s certainly better than the existing format, we can definitely reuse it.\n\nWe simply need to add these CSS classes:\n\n* `.time_ago` ??? displays relative time like `X seconds/minutes/days ago`\n* `.time_readable` ??? displays the timestamp formatted according to the user???s browser locale, e.g., `04/28/2025, 04:00:01 PM` or `28.04.2025, 16:00:01`\n\nexample:\n\n```\n<p class=\"text-xs text-gray-500 time_ago\" x-text=\"date\">{{date}}</p>\n```\n\nneeds to be edited to:\n\n```\n<p class=\"text-xs text-gray-500 time_ago\" x-text=\"date\">{{date}}</p>\n```\n\nso in browser it transforms to:\n```\n<p class=\"text-xs text-gray-500 time_ago\" x-text=\"date\" title=\"04/28/2025, 04:00:01 PM\">70 days ago</p>\n```\n\n@GHANGHASASHWANI, if you can, please navigate through the user and admin interfaces and update every instance of timestamps to use these classes accordingly, im happy to assist with finding the appropriate templates, just share the page link.", "@stefanpejcic \nValid points! \nBut I think IP shouldn't be considered, as I could be using a VPN and that would mess up my dates. Or if I'm an American on the EU, the dates on my panel would be messed up according to where I am so it is not good for UX.\n\nBrowser locale seems better, although the perfect solution for user flexibility would be to have the possibility of having it both as a global server setting + user setting.\n\nI can set my global server to always display date in `DD/MM/YYYY H:i:s` but for a specific user, he can set his account to `YYYY-MM-DD h:i:s A`\n\nFor now I feel like yes, adding those classes as of right now will already be an upgrade, since the date is barely readable by the common user, but we could think of this in the future.\n\nIt should be something like Localization Options, where besides choosing language, we could chose the format wanted for this fields display.\n\nWhat do you think? If you think this would be a good feature just add it to the roadmap or for the future, as I believe this would require some time to be implemented, and for sure it's not High Priority.\n\n_Also I believe you have a typo on your previous comment, because all the lines are using `time_ago` and I believe it should be `time_readable`._", "Hey @stefanpejcic,\nThanks for assigning me the issue.\nBeing new to open source contribution\nPlease guide me for the local setup of the project so that i can move forward with resolving the date formatting issue and can verify it on the local server ??\n", "Sure, do you have a spare VPS available for testing, or would you like me to provide one?\n\nIf you already have a VPS, [[install the panel as usual](https://openpanel.com/docs/admin/intro/#installation)](https://openpanel.com/docs/admin/intro/#installation).\n\nThen follow these steps:\n\n1.

I was looking at our existing implementation and noticed that the change I wanted to make would only ever add the metadata of top level array, however, it makes sense that for nested arrays this could grow a lot. However, we still have a problem of serialized size could not match the in memory size or you could have arrays that can't be serialized. Let me open a pr to see ", "I think it makes sense for nbytes == sum size of all buffers. It's a clean, deterministic number. Maybe the follow up here is to document the method as such.\n\nIf you want a custom measure, for computeing a cache weight or whatever, then I'd say that's something quite specific to the application. Consumer can define their own extension trait, and implement something over depth_first_iterator.\n\nIf you want an exact size, then you're going to have to serialize into byte buffers (which includes _all_ metadata), but obviously that's needlessly expensive for a cache weight.", "I'm not convinced you have to ask all users to reimplement the same thing. There's realistically 3 measures here that anyone might want, the variable size (current nbytes), variable size + in memory size (effectively recursively adding size of self), serialized size. We could have the first 2 but we can implement 2 in spiral for now. 3 is potentially hard since you have to shrink all the buffers to only present values.

Unfortunately, the organization members are not stored with their team details, so it must be fetched separately, one by one. This is not the most efficient, especially not for several teams, but for the MVP it is ???good enough???.\r\n\r\nSince the Organization API returns only the team IDs that the organization have, to get the team details, a call must be made to the [Organization Roles API](https://github.com/opcotech/elemo/blob/main/api/openapi/openapi.yaml#L1996-L2032) which returns the team details. To get the members of a given team, use the [Organization Role Members API](https://github.com/opcotech/elemo/blob/main/api/openapi/openapi.yaml#L2151-L2186). The endpoint returns the list of members per role. These calls are independent (as both requires the organization ID and/or role ID, which is already available).\r\n\r\nWith the information returned from these APIs, add the list of members with the following details about them below the company details: profile picture, name, email, status. Either group the members by their role or add a badge next to their name with the role name. The members which has ???deleted??? status should be listed as well, however, those members should be at the bottom of the list. If the current user is in the list, mark it with a green ???you??? badge next to its name. The badge is [available locally](https://github.com/opcotech/elemo/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#web-component-design) in Storybook.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to bother with member management (add/remote/change role). That's not in scope for this issue.\r\n\r\nBlocked on #155.\r\n\r\n_End-to-end tests are not strictly necessary, but highly welcomed._\n\n### Example Use-cases\n\n- As an organization admin, I want to see who is in the team and what roles do they have.\r\n- As an organization member, I want to see my peers, so if escalation is needed, I know who to contact.\n\n### Drawbacks\n\nAs we have no endpoint to return the list of members combined with their roles, the load time for that page will be bad, but not unmanageable.",

It makes sense for DagRun with multiple versions, but I don't think we should be able to explore DagVersions that are not part of the selected dagrun at all. \n\nIt makes it hard to follow when we start playing with the `version selector` when a DagRun is selected. (Is the DagVersion that I have selected part of the DagRun.dag_versions, or am I watching a completely unrelated structure)\n\n\nFor instance in the following image I have the `v2` structure displayed for a DagRun that actually only has `v4` part of his versions. The output graph doesn't make much sense.\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb45d6a5-514f-464e-b756-39c8b0a70c39)\n\n\nI do not know yet what is the best way to address this, any idea is welcome.\n### Committer\n\n- [x] I acknowledge that I am a maintainer/committer of the Apache Airflow project.",

      "description" : "### Feature request description\n\nWhen using `podman events` one can specify a label filter.\nThe filter has to explicitly contain the label key as well as the label value to get the events, e.g. for a container.\nThis does not allow filtering for events, where the label key is known but the value isn't. E.g. filter all events with key `foo`, no matter what the value is.\n\nThis can be reproduced like this:\n1. Listen to all events with label key `foo`: `podman events --filter label=\"foo\"`\n2. Start a container with the label: `podman run --label \"foo=bar\"  --rm --name echo docker.io/ealen/echo-server`\n\nIn this case, no event is received.\n\nOn the other hand, when explicitly stating key and value like this:\n1. `podman events --filter label=\"foo=bar\"`\n2. `podman run --label \"foo=bar\"  --rm --name echo docker.io/ealen/echo-server`\n\nthe container start and stop events are shown.\n\n---\n\nOther commands like `podman container ls` do seem to support the label key only syntax:\n```sh\npodman container ls --filter label=\"foo\"\n```\nwill list the container.\n\n\n### Suggest potential solution\n\n`podman events` filter should behave the same as the `podman container ls` filter, e.g. when given only a label key, all resources should be returned with the given label key, no matter the label value.\n\n\n### Have you considered any alternatives?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\nThis is a feature that is also supported by Dockers event filter, e.g. from their [docs](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/system/events/#filter):\n> The currently supported filters are:\n> - label (`label=<key>` or `label=<key>=<value>`)\n> - [...]",

      "description" : "**Describe the bug**\nThe error message for `max_fields_limit_exceeded` does not state the precise issue that is being encountered.\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n1. Add one document with 65,535 unique fields\n2. Add a second document with a new unique field\n3. The second task fails with the error code `max_fields_limit_exceeded`, stating: `A document cannot contain more than 65,535 fields.`, although the second document only has a single field\n\n**Expected behavior**\n- Correctly state the actual rules that are implemented.\n- Update the documentation on limitations to match the actual rules.\n- Update the documentation to document the `max_fields_limit_exceeded` error code, which isn't correctly the case.\n\n**Actual rules**\n\n1. Unique fields **across all documents** are counted from 0 to 65,534\n2. A single index cannot have more than 65,535 unique fields across all documents\n3. Removing a field from all documents does not restore a free slot; once all fields are exhausted one should instead create a new index or at least clear all documents. Updating through a dump also restores the free slots\n4. While the error code is not documented, the [limitation is](https://www.meilisearch.com/docs/learn/resources/known_limitations#maximum-number-of-attributes-per-document). However, the explanation is wrong as the limit is for unique fields across all documents of an index, not for a single document.\n5. As the number of unique fields increases, the performance of Meilisearch decreases. It is not recommended to have \"many\" unique fields in an index.\n\n**Suggestion for the new error message**\n\nAdding the document with id `document_id` would add 1 new unique field to the index, exceeding the limit of 65,535 unique fields in the index.\n- note: prior to this batch of tasks, the index already contained 65,535 unique fields.\n- note: other documents from the same batch might have successfully added new unique fields before this one.\n\n\n**Meilisearch version:**\nv1.14.0\n\n**Additional context**\nInternal issue comment: https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-support/issues/829#issuecomment-2801044022\n\n@meilisearch/docs-team ",

During this process, the raw node IDs are generally omitted from the final context sent to the model to keep it clean and readable for the LLM. This is why the nodes and edges are not visible in the final generated answer.\n\n------------\n\n### How to get Citations or References\n\nIf you are running from source code, you can see which nodes are used by logging them directly within the retriever.\n\n1. Edit the file:\n   cognee/modules/retrieval/graph_completion_retriever.py\n\n2. Add a print/log statement:\n\n   Inside the get_context method, find where the triplets are retrieved from the graph and add a line to print or log them before they are processed further.\n\n   ```python\n   # Inside the get_context method of GraphCompletionRetriever\n   ...\n   triplets = await self.get_triplets(query)\n   ...\n   # Add this line to see the raw source data\n   print(\"Retrieved triplets:\", triplets)     # <-- Add this line\n   return await self.resolve_edges_to_text(triplets)\n   ```\n\nThis will log the exact nodes and relationships that are being used as the foundation for the LLM's answer, allowing you to validate the output directly." ],

In this issue, the dataframes contain equal values which are incorrectly treated as different.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe test should succeed, since the only difference is the dtypes, and `check_dtype=False`.\n\n### Installed Versions\n\n<details>\n\npandas                : 2.2.3\nnumpy                 : 1.26.4\npytz                  : 2025.2\ndateutil              : 2.9.0.post0\npip                   : 24.0\nCython                : None\nsphinx                : None\nIPython               : None\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\nbs4                   : None\nblosc                 : None\nbottleneck            : None\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\nfastparquet           : None\nfsspec                : None\nhtml5lib              : None\nhypothesis            : None\ngcsfs                 : None\njinja2                : 3.1.6\nlxml.etree            : None\nmatplotlib            : None\nnumba                 : None\nnumexpr               : None\nodfpy                 : None\nopenpyxl              : 3.1.5\npandas_gbq            : None\npsycopg2              : None\npymysql               : None\npyarrow               : 19.0.1\npyreadstat            : None\npytest                : 8.3.5\npython-calamine       : None\npyxlsb                : None\ns3fs                  : None\nscipy                 : None\nsqlalchemy            : 2.0.41\ntables                : None\ntabulate              : None\nxarray                : None\nxlrd                  : None\nxlsxwriter            : None\nzstandard             : 0.23.0\ntzdata                : 2025.2\nqtpy                  : None\npyqt5                 : None\n\n</details>\n",

The description text _must_ include reproduction steps with either of command-line SwiftPM commands, `swift build`, `swift test`, `swift package` etc.\n\n### Description\n\nWhen an error occurs during the build phase with the `swift build` command, `swiftbuild` build system uses `stderr` as output stream to report the error. `xcode` and `native` build systems use `stdout`. \n\nHere is the PR that discussed about this issue: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-package-manager/pull/8858\n\nMoreover `swift run` command uses `stderr` as output stream for all build system, leading to more confusion.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI expect a consistent output stream between build systems when an error occurs with `swift build` command.\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nWhen running the `swift build` command on a package with syntax error here are the different outputs:\n\n#### swift build --build-system swiftbuild > stdout-swiftbuild.txt 2> stderr-swiftbuild.txt\n\nStderr:\n```\n/Users/***/Desktop/Sample/Sources/Sample/Sample.swift:5:1: error: expected ')' in expression list\n\n^\n/Users/***/Desktop/Sample/Sources/Sample/Sample.swift:4:6: note: to match this opening '('\nprint(\"done\"\n     ^\nerror: /Users/***/Desktop/Sample/Sources/Sample/Sample.swift:5:1 expected ')' in expression list\n\n^\nerror: Build failed\n```\n\nStdout:\n```\nBuilding for debugging...\n19%: 1???/???10\n```\n#### swift build --build-system xcode > stdout-xcode.txt 2> stderr-xcode.txt\n\nStderr:\n```\n```\n\nStdout:\n```\n0%: Compute target dependency graph\nBuilding targets in dependency order\nTarget dependency graph (3 targets)\n0%: Gather provisioning inputs\n0%: Create build description\n0%: Build stat cache for /Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX26.0.sdk\n14%: Planning Swift module Sample (arm64)\n14%: Planning Swift module Sample (x86_64)\nexpected ')' in expression list\n\n^\nto match this opening '('\nprint(\"done\"\n     ^\nexpected ')' in expression list\n\n^\nto match this opening '('\nprint(\"done\"\n     ^\nBuild failed\n```\n\n#### swift build --build-system native > stdout-native.txt 2> stderr-native.txt\n\nStderr:\n```\n```\n\nStdout:\n```\n[0/1] Planning build\nBuilding for debugging...\n[0/1] Write swift-version-39B54973F684ADAB.txt\nerror: emit-module command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)\n[2/3] Emitting module Sample\n/Users/***/Desktop/Sample/Sources/Sample/Sample.swift:5:1: error: expected ')' in expression list\n2 | // https://docs.swift.org/swift-book\n3 | \n4 | print(\"done\"\n  |      `- note: to match this opening '('\n5 | \n  | `- error: expected ')' in expression list\n[3/3] Compiling Sample Sample.swift\n/Users/***/Desktop/Sample/Sources/Sample/Sample.swift:5:1: error: expected ')' in expression list\n2 | // https://docs.swift.org/swift-book\n3 | \n4 | print(\"done\"\n  |      `- note: to match this opening '('\n5 | \n  | `- error: expected ')' in expression list\n```\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1.

      "description" : "## Open Source Contributors Welcomed!\r\nPlease comment below if you would like to work on this issue!\r\n\r\n### Contact Details [Optional]\r\n\r\nsupport@zenml.io\r\n\r\n## What happened?\r\nZenML currently uses Python's `pickle` module (via [`cloudpickle` library](https://pypi.org/project/cloudpickle/)) for model serialization and materialization. However, the [safetensors](https://github.com/huggingface/safetensors) library is fast becoming a standard for storing tensors and model weights, offering a reasonable alternative to `pickle`. Integrating `safetensors` into ZenML would provide users with a more efficient and secure option for model serialization.\r\n\r\n## Task Description\r\nImplement support for using `safetensors` instead of `pickle` for model materialization in ZenML. The task involves the following:\r\n\r\n1. Modify the base materializers to use `safetensors` for model serialization.\r\n2. Update the integration-specific materializers (located in `src/zenml/integrations`) to utilize `safetensors` where appropriate.\r\n3. Ensure backward compatibility with existing `pickle`-based serialized models.\r\n4. Update relevant documentation and examples to reflect the new `safetensors` option.\r\n\r\n## Expected Outcome\r\n- ZenML will support model serialization using `safetensors`, providing a faster and more secure alternative to `pickle`.\r\n- Users will have the option to choose between `pickle` and `safetensors` for model materialization.\r\n- The integration of `safetensors` will be seamless, maintaining compatibility with existing ZenML workflows.\r\n- Documentation and examples will be updated to guide users on how to utilize the `safetensors` option effectively.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Implement\r\n1. Familiarize yourself with the `safetensors` library and its usage for model serialization.\r\n2. Modify the base materializers in ZenML to include support for `safetensors` serialization.\r\n3. Identify integration-specific materializers in `src/zenml/integrations` that would benefit from `safetensors` and update them accordingly.\r\n4. Implement backward compatibility measures to ensure existing `pickle`-based serialized models can still be loaded.\r\n5. Update relevant documentation, including the user guide and API reference, to explain the new `safetensors` option and provide examples of its usage.\r\n6. Write unit / integration tests to verify the functionality of `safetensors` serialization in various scenarios.\r\n7. Submit a pull request with the implemented changes for review.\r\n\r\n## Additional Context\r\nIntegrating `safetensors` into ZenML aligns with the project's goal of providing efficient and secure tools for machine learning workflows. By offering an alternative to `pickle`, ZenML empowers users with more options for model serialization, catering to their specific needs and preferences.\r\n\r\n## Code of Conduct\r\n- [ ] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct",

      "comments" : [ "Hi @strickvl I want to work on this task. \r\n\r\nBy reading your detailed description I found out that `safetensors` could be used for `Huggingface`, `PyTorch`, `PyTorch Lightning` and `Tensorflow` integrations. And we could change the current method to use safetensors to store the model. Please correct me if I'm wrong here.\r\n\r\nHere I could add a new materialize named for eg. `SafetensorsMaterializer` similar to `CloudPickleMaterializer`.\r\n\r\nBut I'm struggling with figuring out how can we show users both the option of `pickle` and `safetensors`, I mean where can we make this change? As I'm new to this repo, please can you guide me a little on this? Thanks :)", "Hi @Dev-Khant good question!\r\n\r\nI think what would be the best first place to start would be simply to add new materializers that use safetensors. Then we can allow users to specify them as a custom materializer for their chosen outputs. (See [here](https://docs.zenml.io/user-guide/advanced-guide/data-management/handle-custom-data-types) for more details on that).\r\n\r\nWe can keep the new materializers as part of the standard library, but they just wouldn't be the default. (The alternative would be to have a config option on the materializer itself, but that's a big / complicated feature to implement and I think we shouldn't start there).\r\n\r\nSo, don't change the existing materializers but add new ones that use safetensors and update the docs so that people know how to use these parallel options. Hope that makes sense!", "@strickvl Totally Understood. As you said we will have parallel options for materialized, so correct if me I am wrong, we will have let's say two `HFPTModelMaterializer` one would be with the current approach and another one with safetensors. ", "Correct.", "@strickvl can you assign this issue to me? thanks.", "@Saedbhati sure go for it! I've assigned it to you. Please keep in mind the conversation in this thread however :-) ", "I am working on this as well! ", "@htahir1 \r\nI was looking through #2539 and am curious (in terms of a torch materializer) if it would be more efficient to use `safetensors.safe_open` and `safetensors.save_file` for load and save functionality respectively.\r\n\r\nWhile this approach would require handling single versus multiple tensors slightly differently I feel it would avoid the  problem of saving/loading models twice.\r\n\r\nWould there be a downside to this approach? \r\n\r\n", "@JasonBodzy thanks for the interest - it's an interesting suggestion! Using safetensors' native functions could potentially help avoid the double-save problem we ran into earlier.\r\n\r\nThough we'd need to solve a couple of challenges:\r\n1. Remote storage compatibility - safetensors functions need to work with ZenML's fileio wrappers to support remote artifact stores (which was a blocker in previous attempts)\r\n2. Model architecture handling - we still need an efficient way to save/load this alongside the weights\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? If you're keen to explore this approach further, would be great to see how these pieces could come together. Feel free to share more thoughts or suggestions on tackling these requirements :-)\r\n\r\n@bcdurak curious about your thoughts here too!", "Hi!i is this still being worked on? if it hasn't been resolved id love to try and resolve it ", "@Squishedmac go for it!", "Hello !! is this issue still open ?? i would like to work on it...

'ask' code doesn't seem to check for '<html>', just assumes it;s a regular link in isAutoPlayable(), but I might be wrong and it might use a different route.\n- A whitelist for some thrusted sites (marketplace and other LL resources, wiki)\n- Content attached/marked by active 'experience'.\n- HUDs (if they are somehow covered by ParcelMediaAutoPlayEnable)\n\nThis will make 'ask' option a lot less distruptive to new users experience" ],

This DAG can exist or not - the error still shows.\r\n\r\nWe have found many different topics across the Internet for various Airflow versions. Some of them from 2018. So users constantly witness these dangling messages, but there are no clarification for this case.\r\n\r\nAlso we don't have an understanding what is a source for this notification message. It sits in the Airflow DB and webserver is selecting it from there or other core components are generating it for webserver somehow.\n\n### What you think should happen instead?\n\nEven though the error message itself is far from perfect, we expect that if DAG doesn't exist anymore, the error message should disappear.\n\n### How to reproduce\n\nWe use gitsync option for storing DAGs:\r\n````yaml\r\n# DAGs Config\r\ndags:\r\n  gitSync:\r\n    enabled: true\r\n    repo: \"https://my.repo/path/name.git\"\r\n    branch: \"master\"\r\n    rev: \"HEAD\"\r\n    subPath: \"airflowk8s/dags\"\r\n    credentialsSecret: my-secret\r\n    period: 5s\r\n    maxFailures: 10\r\n````\r\nAnd our DAG is just script.py like that, nothing complicated:\r\n`print(\"D0ne!\")`\r\n\r\nSo I guess steps should be:\r\n1) Create a broken DAG in remote repository;\r\n2) Get the error message in the Airflow's web-interface;\r\n3) Delete a broken DAG in remote repository;\r\n4) Wait for your gitsync;\r\n5) The error message in the Airflow's web-interface will dangle.\r\n\r\nBut this bug appears randomly, so we don't know exact reason.\n\n### Operating System\n\nKubernetes  v1.31.0-eks\n\n### Versions of Apache Airflow Providers\n\n_No response_\n\n### Deployment\n\nOfficial Apache Airflow Helm Chart\n\n### Deployment details\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Are you willing to submit PR?\n\n- [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n",

A workaround helped.\nIn the future we will try to work like that \"you'd need to fix the dag first and then delete it\".\n\nBut I guess it would be helpful to validate entries in this table somehow?

I would like to fix it.", "Assigned.", "Hi @eanikindfi & @potiuk , I need clarification on the correct codebase version. The [ Artifact Hub](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/apache-airflow/airflow) lists the version as 2.9.3, but the description mentions 2.10.2. Should I refer to the 2.10.2 codebase for this?", "Not sure about the question. ArtifactHub mentiond \"default\" version of airflow but you can change it in the chart. So I am not sure what you are asking for. All the changes in airflow are developed in main anyway, with few exception where we cannot make a change any more and backport it, we might contribute to latest stable branch for core airflow. And we are currently in the stage where we develop Airflow 3 and the rules are slighlty different - see https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/dev/README_AIRFLOW3_DEV.md", "I am working with airflow version 2.9.3 and facing the similar issue with the dangling error message of import error. \n\nIf i exec to the pod and run: airflow dags list-import-errors i see the correct state but on web the error message is not going away. This means that the meta DB is having the right state but some how the error message is stuck with the web and restarting the pod is not resolving it. Rollout deployment is also not fixing the error. Deleting the helm release and redeploying not working.\n\nI don't find any work around to it.", "> I am working with airflow version 2.9.3 and facing the similar issue with the dangling error message of import error.\n> \n> If i exec to the pod and run: airflow dags list-import-errors i see the correct state but on web the error message is not going away.

You need an access to airflow DB itself for it.", "Hi @valentinDruzhinin, just following up ??? how are we progressing on this issue?", "Hi @vatsrahul1001 . I'm trying to catch this issue but unsuccessfully. Please unassign me from this issue, maybe someone else can catch the error and fix it. Sorry for that.\n", "Issue summary:\n1. Create a DAG with a parsing error inside files/dags/{file_name}.\n2. Wait for the bundle sync (~3???4 mins), then open the Airflow UI/reload the web interface.\n3. The UI highlights a parsing error using data from the `import_errors` table.\n4. Now delete the faulty DAG file without fixing the error.\n5. The error still shows up in the UI even though the file no longer exists.\n\nWhy is this happening ?\nThe issue lies in the `_refresh_dag_bundles` method of `DagFileProcessorManager`.\nThis condition skips bundle refresh.\n```\nif (\n    elapsed_time_since_refresh < bundle.refresh_interval\n    and current_version_matches_db\n    and previously_seen\n    and bundle.name not in self._force_refresh_bundles\n):\n    self.log.info(\"Not time to refresh bundle %s\", bundle.name)\n    continue\n```\nSo if the DAG file was deleted, but the above condition is still True, the bundle isn???t refreshed and import_errors aren???t cleared. The error disappears only after the condition eventually fails and the bundle is refreshed.\n\nAdditionally, since the frontend relies on manual reloads and has no real-time update mechanism, users keep seeing stale error messages until they refresh the page after the backend has synced.\n\nPossible Fixes:\n1. Lift the orphan cleanup logic\nMove up this logic so it runs regardless of the bundle refresh skip:\n```\nfound_files = {\n    DagFileInfo(rel_path=p, bundle_name=bundle.name, bundle_path=bundle.path)\n    for p in self._find_files_in_bundle(bundle)\n}\nknown_files[bundle.name] = found_files\n\nself.clear_orphaned_import_errors(\n    bundle_name=bundle.name,\n    observed_filelocs={str(x.rel_path) for x in found_files},\n)\n```\nThis ensures that when a DAG file is deleted, its corresponding `import_error` entries are also cleared.\n\n2. Lower refresh_interval\nReduce the `dag_processor.refresh_interval` to trigger syncs more frequently.\n\n3. Make `is_stale` column atomic:\nCurrently, the `is_stale` column in the dag table is overloaded - it tracks both deleted DAG files and parsing errors. We should make `is_stale` track only deletions and rely on `has_import_errors` for parse failures. This separation would make the DB state clearer and reduce ambiguity. Once done, the Get Import Errors API can also be tweaked to exclude entries related to deleted files.\n\n4. Event-driven UI updates\nImprove the frontend to automatically refresh when the backend updates bundle state instead of relying on manual reloads.\n\n@vatsrahul1001 @uranusjr  Let me know how we want to proceed so that I can go ahead and implement the fix." ],

      "description" : "Hello\r\n\r\nThank you for your continuous efforts in maintaining and improving Charabia. I???m writing to request support for the Persian language in your normalization and segmentation modules, similar to the existing support for Arabic.\r\n\r\n### **Background**\r\nPersian (Farsi) is a widely spoken language, using the same script as Arabic with some additional letters. Although Persian shares many similarities with Arabic, there are important differences in orthography, morphology, and syntax that require distinct handling for proper text processing, especially in tasks like tokenization, normalization, and segmentation.\r\n\r\n- Language ISO code is: `per`, `fa`\r\n\r\n### **Feature Request**\r\nI would like to request the addition of Persian language support for:\r\n\r\n1. **Normalization:**\r\n   - Handling Persian-specific characters, such as \"??\", \"??\", \"??\", \"??\".\r\n   - Differentiating between Arabic and Persian diacritics and letters where applicable (e.g., \"??\" vs. \"??\", \"??\" vs. \"??\").\r\n   - Normalizing Persian numerals (??-??) and ensuring compatibility with Arabic numerals where necessary.\r\n\r\n2. **Segmentation:**\r\n   - Properly segmenting Persian text based on its unique grammatical structure.\r\n   - Handling word boundaries and tokenization in the context of Persian, considering the language's syntax and morphology.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2024-08-12 11-57-15](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9135d070-9392-4160-bb19-988fa7e3dd47)\r\n![Screenshot from 2024-08-12 11-57-30](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e53a052-be0f-4e0b-87fc-f37147e473b8)\r\n\r\n### **References**\r\nTo aid in this implementation, here are the links to the current normalization and segmentation implementations for Arabic, which can serve as a starting point for Persian:\r\n\r\n- [Arabic Normalizer](https://github.com/meilisearch/charabia/blob/main/charabia/src/normalizer/arabic.rs)\r\n- [Arabic Segmenter](https://github.com/meilisearch/charabia/blob/main/charabia/src/segmenter/arabic.rs)\r\n\r\n### **Conclusion**\r\nImplementing Persian language support would greatly benefit users who need to process Persian text accurately. Persian is distinct enough from Arabic that this feature would significantly improve text processing capabilities for Persian-speaking users. I???m happy to contribute in any way I can to support this effort.\r\n",

Very weird.\n\nI think it depends on how you are running the `airflow` command and whether the container you are running it in has the FAB provider installed and FAB Auth manager configured. Can you check it ?\n", "First of all, and as always thank you so much for Apache Airflow :), I've depended on it for years for many projects.\n\nAnd yes, as far as I can tell we do have it installed. Some \"evidence\" that may help, short of showing the running system.\n\n1. I'm using a custom docker image (but based on apache/airflow:3.0.0-python3.12) that includes this in its requirements: **apache-airflow-providers-fab==2.0.1**. This is a gist with its definition and related files: https://gist.github.com/mrbungie/ab8e2a2104e56c7d6dc8872d01d44f9a\n2. I'm setting the following relevant values in my helm chart: https://gist.github.com/mrbungie/eaae9aed11d04b04d960376788d3e91e (here im showing it with webserver.defaultUser = false, but when I set it to true, the createUser fails)\n3. We implemented a webserver_config.py (shown in [1] gist integrated with EntraID). And it works, so FAB is working.\n\nWhen I get into most containers, they do have the users subcommand:\n<img width=\"1260\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee48e1aa-ec4a-49be-be7c-37fa666eddfa\" />\n\nBut when checking the create-user container (after setting createUser to true), it fails.\n\n<img width=\"727\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a486456-24c5-4d5e-a2b9-e918ea0416e3\" />\n<img width=\"1271\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79d1a1f3-dd36-44a3-9306-f9dd40cab6ed\" />\n\nI'm pretty sure it has to do with the fact that the env vars overriding Auth are not reaching the createUser container.\ncreate-user envvars:\n\n<img width=\"730\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abb8def2-b78c-464c-9ecd-f0317f421901\" />\n\nMeanwhile other containers (like api-server)\n\n<img width=\"731\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea1437bb-c9c1-470c-9df1-f5f74ba42b6a\" />\n\nI guess that means that that setting (i.e. airflow.core.auth_manager / AIRFLOW__CORE__AUTH_MANAGER) **should be set exclusively via airflow.cfg**, but I think docs should be clearer about that.\n\nIf that's not the hoped behaviour, I would guess AIRFLOW__CORE__AUTH_MANAGER, if set, should be propagated down into the create-user container (after all, if its going to run create-user in Airflow 3, it should have that set to FAB or it is always going to fail). Maybe the create-user container should check if FAB is on (via env var + airflow.cfg), and if not, it should just continue gracefully and maybe logging that so users are advised to set createUser = false if they are just using Simple Auth. \n\nIf anything I'm saying makes sense, I can make a PR fixing this in some direction you propose.\n\nMore info:\nHelm chart commit SHA256: https://github.com/apache/airflow/commit/3bd9746d5c30d47fec1e50cc95a3b83add1ee3e8\n \n<img width=\"1460\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24d3c3b4-bbbe-4b24-8d50-d2bc194cbaa2\" />", "OK.

Anyone is invited to fix it.", "> If anything I'm saying makes sense, I can make a PR fixing this in some direction you propose.\n\nMakes absolutely sense. Thanks for all those invstigations @mrbungie ! and Fix would be really nice!", "From version>=3.0.0, no subcommand 'users'.\n\nYou would have to use airflow standalone, which also gets an error", "@mrbungie may I ask how you added the `AIRFLOW__CORE__AUTH_MANAGER` env variable? Did you add it through the `extraEnv:`/`extraEnvFrom`, or through the `config.core:` section (or any other way)?", "I'm looking into this issue and would like to contribute if it's still unresolved.", "This happens because Airflow 3.x uses SimpleAuthManager as the default auth manager, which does not support the airflow users CLI command.\n\nEven if you try to use FabAuthManager, the system may override it back to SimpleAuthManager???especially in dev setups (like Breeze or standalone mode), where the environment is explicitly set or forced during container startup.\n\nTo fix this and re-enable the users CLI, you need to explicitly set the following environment variable:\n\nexport AIRFLOW__CORE__AUTH_MANAGER=airflow.providers.fab.auth_manager.fab_auth_manager.FabAuthManager\n\nand restarting the breeze environment \n\n<img width=\"1842\" height=\"567\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/743dd1df-95f8-440c-856c-4ddcf6c746e9\" />\n<img width=\"1263\" height=\"579\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6db6bd8-7561-4d5e-8047-333e48dee536\" />", "Changed default Breeze auth_manager to FabAuthManager (from simple_auth).

      "comments" : [ "# :wave: Important: PLEASE READ :wave:\n\nThis issue has been labeled as a **good first issue** and is available for anyone to work on.\n\nIf this is your first time contributing to an open source project, some aspects of the development process may seem unusual, arcane, or some combination of both.\n\n1.  **You cannot \"claim\" issues.** People new to open source often want to \"claim\" or be assigned an issue before beginning work. The typical rationale is that people want to avoid wasted work in the event that someone else ends up working the issue. However, this practice is not effective in open source, as it often leads to \"issue squatting\", in which an individual asks to be assigned, is granted their request, and then never ends up working on the issue. Accordingly, you are encouraged to communicate your intent to address this issue, ideally by providing a rough outline as to how you plan to address the issue or asking clarifying questions, but, at the end of the day, we will take running code and rough consensus in order to move forward quickly.\n2.  **We have a very high bar for contributions.** We have very high standards for contributions and expect all contributions???whether new features, tests, or documentation???to be rigorous, thorough, and complete. Once a pull request is merged into stdlib, that contribution immediately becomes the collective responsibility of all maintainers of stdlib. When we merge code into stdlib, we are saying that we, the maintainers, commit to reviewing subsequent changes and making bugfixes to the code. Hence, in order to ensure future maintainability, this naturally leads to a higher standard of contribution.\n\nBefore working on this issue and opening a pull request, please read the project's [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md). These guidelines and the associated [development guide](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/docs/contributing/development.md) provide important information, including links to stdlib's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), license policy, and steps for setting up your local development environment.\n\nTo reiterate, we **strongly** encourage you to refer to our contributing guides **before** beginning work on this issue. Failure to follow our guidelines significantly decreases the likelihood that you'll successfully contribute to stdlib and may result in automatic closure of a pull request without review.\n\nSetting up your local development environment is a critical first step, as doing so ensures that automated development processes for linting, license verification, and unit testing can run prior to authoring commits and pushing changes. If you would prefer to avoid manual setup, we provide pre-configured [development containers](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/tree/develop/.devcontainer) for use locally or in GitHub Codespaces.\n\nWe place a high value on consistency throughout the stdlib codebase. We encourage you to closely examine other packages in stdlib and attempt to emulate the practices and conventions found therein.\n\n-   If you are attempting to contribute a new package, sometimes the best approach is to simply copy the contents of an existing package and then modify the minimum amount necessary to implement the feature (e.g., changing descriptions, parameter names, and implementation).\n-   If you are contributing tests, find a package implementing a similar feature and emulate the tests of that package.\n-   If you are updating documentation, examine several similar packages and emulate the content, style, and prose of those packages.\n\nIn short, the more effort you put in to ensure that your contribution looks and feels like stdlib???including variables names, bracket spacing, line breaks, etc???the more likely that your contribution will be reviewed and ultimately accepted. We encourage you to closely study the codebase **before** beginning work on this issue.\n\n:sparkles: Thank you again for your interest in stdlib, and we look forward to reviewing your future contributions. :sparkles:\n", "PR raised here: #7763 ???> fixes the capitalization of \"binomial\" in the entropy package heading as noted in the commit comment.

A synchronizer node includes a Sequencer, a Mediator, and an ordering service. The ordering service can be either CometBFT or a postgresql database. Right now the postgresql database isn't supported in production in 3.x (expected in 3.2) and doesn't work in decentralized mode either (that's where you use CometBFT).\r\n> - Operates the Super Validator app, which records work performed by various nodes, and returns to those nodes the records they need in order to mint Canton Coin in return for that work, plus other network governance activities.\r\n> - Operates the Scan database and API\r\n> - Operates the Canton Name Service app.\r\n\r\nThis was prompted by @filmackay asking:\r\n\r\n> I don't quite understand the difference between a super-validator and a validator, other than the fact there is a different sequencer being used (comet-bft v reference).\r\n\r\n*Remove this line once you have selected the correct milestone.*\r\n\r\n## How important is this and why?\r\n\r\nEasier access and learning experience for newcomers, as pointed out by @iggy-da\r\n\r\n",

And from what i read [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/0fdbbbf032f06be3092cd4714378bc1c0c40caac/specification/common/mapping-to-non-otlp.md?plain=1#L75C1-L79C79) so i think based on that\n **_Jaeger's OTLP parser expects unsigned integers for fields like `droppedAttributesCount`_**\n\nI don't want to direct you into wrong direction so I hope someone from maintainers team check if i am getting it correctly?\n@yurishkuro is this correct? or are it's something that needs to be fixed on jaeger?", "also we can see here that 'droppedAttributesCount' is here unsigned int\n\nhttps://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/blob/ffade295895a2be5a6e7931eb0cda1c72bc4c0f6/opentelemetry/proto/trace/v1/trace.proto#L215-L218", "@MAX-786 thanks for your investigation.

Yeah I had also figured out the replacement character, and the location of the -1 (the 10th byte of the snippet in the log). But I don't get why the parser would replace a valid character like - or 1 by the replacement character. This is normally meant for encoding errors.\n\nYou're right that it's possible that some deserialization process just decides -1 is so outrageous that it needs to be converted to the replacement character \uD83D\uDE06 but that would be a very weird way to fail as opposed to a simple error mentioning the bounds.\n\nI'm using the opentelemetry-java library to generate these traces, so it could be a bug there if it produces negative values when it shouldn't.", "about 'error message could be better'\nI am all up for that because IT WILL REALLY HELP IN MANY SITUATION because right now we have to watch docker logs for that (which is not a bad think imho) but still something more detailed in UI will help.\nIG we can open up small issue for this", "@yurishkuro I still believe this issue warrants better error handling, but I guess it is on the Jaeger server side, not Jaeger UI.

Nothing crashes, you get an error in the UI when trying to import a malformed file.\n\nYep i think he phrased it wrong (hopefully) and he meant that it can show better error message as you already said above.", "Well there are two things here:\n  1. The UI just says \"error converting OTLP traces\". Since there is a more detailed (even though unhelpful) error message in the logs I think it would make sense for it to be reflected in the UI. That is a reasonable fix we can make.\n  2. Improving the underlying error message itself (instead of going about `\\ufffd`) - here there's not much we can do because the error is coming from a JSON parser, and quite likely from gogoproto library, which is no longer maintained.", "> What better error handing do you expect here? Nothing crashes\n\nInternal server error is a crash as far as I can tell (on server side, but still). It would be best if the server handled the error properly, and then offered an error message that the UI could display instead of the generic failure.\nIIRC I was getting an HTTP 500 (to be confirmed), so I guess it's fair for the UI to just show a generic error, but the core of the issue is that this shouldn't warrant a 500. Probably a 400 instead.\n\n> Improving the underlying error message itself (instead of going about \\ufffd) - here there's not much we can do because the error is coming from a JSON parser, and quite likely from gogoproto library, which is no longer maintained\n\nI think there is a lot that can be done here. Catching the error, parsing the error message, changing to a maintained library, etc. I'm not saying this is simple, but I don't think it's fair to say that not much can be done.", "I checked - the server already returns the best error it can muster given the underlying library's response: `{\"data\":null,\"total\":0,\"limit\":0,\"offset\":0,\"errors\":[{\"code\":500,\"msg\":\"cannot unmarshal OTLP : readUint32: unexpected character: \\ufffd, error found in #10 byte of ...|esCount\\\":-1}],\\\"links|..., bigger context ...|AR to the classpath\\\"}}],\\\"droppedAttributesCount\\\":-1}],\\\"links\\\":[],\\\"status\\\":{\\\"code\\\":2},\\\"flags\\\":257},{\\\"|...\"}]}`\n\nI agree, it should be 400 error, not 500.

      "description" : "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\n\nPorting some code from `@aws-sdk/client-s3` we have a project that uploads both publicly available resources and private resources to a bucket. In our code this is easily managed by providing a pre-defined ACL value directly:\n\n```typescript\nimport { PutObjectCommand } from \"@aws-sdk/client-s3\";\nconst uploadParams = new PutObjectCommand({\n  ACL: \"public-read\", // ??? this part\n  Body: [?????? Buffer ??????],\n  Bucket: \"my-mixed-bucket\",\n  ContentType: \"text/plain\",\n  Key: \"my-file.txt\",\n});\n```\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nJust like with the Server-Side Encryption headers, it would be nice to be able to provide an ACL value directly to `S3mini#putObject()`. Preferably with the same strings supported as in `PutObjectCommand`.\n\nThe official AWS SDK supports strings they call Canned ACLs, predefined permissions. These seem to have some cross-platform support, as we are actually using Ceph ourselves and not S3. There are 6 possible values:\n\n```typescript\nexport declare const ObjectCannedACL: {\n    readonly authenticated_read: \"authenticated-read\";\n    readonly aws_exec_read: \"aws-exec-read\";\n    readonly bucket_owner_full_control: \"bucket-owner-full-control\";\n    readonly bucket_owner_read: \"bucket-owner-read\";\n    readonly private: \"private\";\n    readonly public_read: \"public-read\";\n    readonly public_read_write: \"public-read-write\";\n};\n```\n\nAnd these [are described in the Amazon S3 documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.html#canned-acl).\n\nIt looks like the Canned ACL value can be passed directly as [an `x-amz-acl` header](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutObject.html#AmazonS3-PutObject-request-header-ACL).\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\nAn alternative solution would be to allow a much more open-ended / generic ???headers??? argument on the `S3mini#putObject`-method. But I like how explicit the current class is with what can and cannot be set.",

That being said, I recommend using this Powertoys utility as a workaround: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/awake\r\n\r\nThanks. But I don't think this is a good approach. \r\n\r\nEven with a consumer version of Windows, an app prevent the system into sleep is very common. I believe you must have used this kind of apps. For example, Video Player like MPV can prevent the system into sleep during playing movies. Music players can prevent the system into sleep when a song is played.\r\n\r\nPowertoys can prevent the system sleep when a specified process is running by its pid. But that is not what I expected. As my idea is to prevent the system sleep only when Ollama is working. If the Ollama server is started but waiting in background, it should not prevent the system into sleep. It is just like the video players, only prevent the system into sleep when a video is playing. \r\n\r\nAlso, even with a consumer version of Windows, the prevent sleep API is provided by the system. So there should no different whether the system is a consumer version or a server version.\r\n\r\nIf I design this feature in Ollama, I will extend the time length of preventing the system into sleep every time Ollama answers a question. Five minutes will be enough.", "This looks like a good first issue.\r\n\r\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-setthreadexecutionstate\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/kumako/go-win64api/blob/ddc2195639e59051ca979119193c5013bf521ef3/process.go#L144\r\n\r\nWired into the scheduler to toggle state when there is (or isn't) an active runner.", "I think it would be handy to add an option in the settings or menu to toggle \"Keep PC Awake\" in Ollama. Not everyone needs their PC to stay awake while using it, so having this option would be great for those who do and for those who don't. It's all about giving users the choice they want. What do you think?", "@owenzhao My guess based on a description of your setup, is windows machine is set up as a ollama server. The server once in a while goes to sleep as you described. You requested that when Ollama is working, Windows machine should not go to sleep and when ollama is not working Windows machine should be allowed to go to sleep.\r\n\r\nI propose a complex solution which could satisfy your needs. \r\n\r\n1. Setup Ollama as a windows service with manual startup. There's numerous ways to do that, from a single line in a terminal to packaging to an installer. Choose your preferred method.\r\n2. Run Ollama with desired settings to work with it.\r\n3. There's also numerous options how to make windows awake as long as specific PID process is awake. If powertoys or similar tools has been used, after service successfully run, get service PID and use it. Other option is to select respective previously created Power Settings on start and end of serving.\r\n4. After job required Ollama has done, created ollama service may be shut down and sleep prevention as well.\r\n5. A neat option is also to use Wake-On-Lan or similar feature to wake up server when required and sending to sleep when it's not.\r\n\r\nPlease note, that it's not common and it's not recommended to prevent sleeping when working from a service. it's generally considered a bad and dangerous practice and there's many other workarounds. Usually when a computer is in server role, it runs all the time without going to sleep (see my suggestion on power/battery settings).", "I found that many of the replies were not got what I meant. So I want to reclaim what I mean.\r\n\r\nFirst, many of you mixed Ollama server started in background and was working. So the suggestions were useless.\r\n\r\nWhen Windows system starts, Ollama server starts alone with it. There is no settings need to do on that. That is the default behavior of Ollama.exe. \r\n\r\nWhen Ollama server starts and no one is using it, I call it starts in background. \r\n\r\nIf I start my own app and use Ollama API to connect with Ollama server, I call it is working.\r\n\r\nMy intent is not kept Windows awake when Ollama server starts in background, which is many of you suggest to use PID with power toy. Again, that was not my intent. My intent is to stop Windows to sleep when I call the Ollama's API and waiting the results. \r\n\r\nCurrently, sometimes when I called Ollama API and was waiting the result or just got the result and before I called the next Ollama API, the Windows slept. That was very odd and I think should be changed.", "@owenzhao \n\n> Ollama starts when windows starts. \n\nIt could be handy when you work on the same computer. To start and stop a service efficiently there's windows services and they are universal. \n\nAlso automatic services start automatically without logging in. \n\n> my intent to stop Ollama to prevent Windows to sleep when I call it. \n\nI don't know how you use it, proposed solution should be good for others as well. I use Ollama sporadically or within IDE, e.g. I expect it running when I work, not per a _single_ request. \n\nAnd based on console logs and local tests, when I run Ollama in interactive mode it doesn't call Ollama all the time and I can restart a server in between calls. And I prefer to keep it this way. \n\nThus,proposed solution is a half-ok as server would go to sleep just after a single request goes off and it would be more frustrating as AFAIK programmatic method doesn't reset sleep timer. \n\nAdditionally, starting and stopping windows server is much easier than you think as it's an unattended action (ssh can be used as a universal solution). \n\nMore so, the best and the most manageable solution is to use required Power Settings, not changing service to prevent OS sleeping, which is the worst practice. \n\nI vote strongly against proposed and against changing how interactive mode works as well. ", "> More so, the best and the most manageable solution is to use required Power Settings, not changing service to prevent OS sleeping, which is the worst practice.\r\n\r\nCan you explain why you think it is the worst practice as many other apps can do that and the system is allowed to do that so they provided API. As I pointed out, many movie players can do that. So why that is the worst practice? I don't think there any drawbacks. As the system only awake during the working time, the system can still go to sleep if Ollama is not needed.", "> Can you explain why you think it is the worst practice as many other apps can do that and the system is allowed to do that so they provided API\r\n\r\nI don't speak for consumer apps, but for services specifically. The reason is quite simple: the administrator defines how computer should work, not a service. And you is an administrator of your computer. Also if a background app preventing computer to go to sleep and user doesn't aware of it (explicit action/setting), then it becomes a hassle to manage actual power settings and battery life, especially if we speak about laptops. For example, I as a developer usually have multiple services on my laptop and if any of them would prevent sleep without my explicit setting, I'd just remove a service, and if I'd like to run a homelab server on a laptop or desktop, I'd set my power settings in such way, that laptop won't go to sleep till I say so. One of a good examples of such behaviour is community project wsusoffline (and their derivatives).\r\n\r\nVideo players are kind'a an exception here (not really), as a user stare at screen for a long period of time and doesn't want to be disturbed from an entertainment. Not really as it is a mass user desire. \r\n\r\nSimplifying things, Ollama is an ordinary HTTP server (it's written in documentation as well), which provides a main function on the backend to ask model to produce some response on some request, nothing more, nothing else. Response is quite small and limited in time. ", "> As the system only awake during the working time, the system can still go to sleep if Ollama is not needed.\r\n\r\nthe definition of \"Ollama is not needed\" is quite vague. It serves a request/response, but don't keep connection alive (which I prefer to keep this way), so the only time Ollama actually serves something is when there's an explicit user interaction. Don't take my word and check it yourself. I tested provided commands in my terminal, you can test in any other way you'd like. \r\n\r\n1. Run Ollama serving (command `ollama serve`)\r\n2. In other terminal (or computer) run `ollama run <model>` with any model you already have.\r\n3. Run a single request to your model \r\n4. Upon request completion, stop the server\r\n5. Check in other terminal, that client tells that server is not running by running next request \r\n6. Spin up server again\r\n7. And run yet another request, it would reply as server was never offline. \r\n\r\nWith this out of the way, I'd define \"Ollama is needed\" as \"I have a session with Ollama\". The script to run Ollama serving contents and set specific predefined power settings and then stopping Ollama and revert Power Settings is more universal and easier to implement. AFAIK, PowerToys require an active GUI session\r\n\r\n* User doesn't need active GUI session to run and stop a server.\r\n* It's easy to run remotely via Open SSH as it's built in in WIndows 10+ by Microsoft itself.\r\n* It's flexible, so you know how to change it's easily by yourself and what exact settings you prefer to have.\r\n* As it's a potentially scripted solution and you know exact schedule when it's needed, Windows Scheduler could be used.\r\n* It doesn't break in a hidden way any expectations a user might have.

You suggest me to use SSH, so you supposed I am using a remote terminal. I am not. I am using an app that use Ollama's API. So there is no SSH, just http.", "Also, I think it is common that a server stops the OS from sleeping. For example, SMB, the file sharing service of the Windows, which is also the preferred file sharing service in macOS. When you play a movie from SMB, the OS runs SMB won't go to sleep as long as you playing the movie. So the SMB must have the ability to stop the OS from sleeping.\r\n\r\nWhat I want is the same. I don't think this is a bad idea. It is just like you don't want the OS to sleep when you are playing a movie on SMB.", "SMB is not the same at all. This is a low-level driver.

You can install any other HTTP servers and try yourself. Even Docker (paid) doesn't prevent computer go to sleep. (I know there's issue that some users complain that docker prevents computer to sleep, while I don't experience this issue on my systems)\r\n\r\nYou want a feature you can do as a power user (not even system administrator) if you just switch power settings to another profile. \r\n\r\nProposed solution by me is easy to implement, easy to use, intuitive and universal. You don't need special knowledge to write specific Power Shell scripts, just copy-paste from other projects including mentioned ones or from services like Stack Overflow. ", "They are just the same. They are the same until you add new rules.\r\n\r\nFirst, you say servers are not apps. Then, you say servers are not the same. So you just want to keep your point, instead of listening. You force me to user power settings, which is totally a different thing. Power setting are set for the global, what I suggest is for the local, specially for the Ollama. Why local should change global? Where are your principles now? \r\n\r\nThis thing is easy and clear. The system provides API to keep the OS awake. The decision is made by developer to improve user experience. Whether to do depends on if the solution is expected by the user. This is the only rule. Not other rules are needed. Intuitively, if a user expects the app should work, then it is a good solution. \r\n    \r\n", "1. How are they the same? You set \"rules\" that they are the same. Please, ask Google Search (or any other similar) if a HTTP server is the same as SMB service and what is a bad or good practice for keeping machine awake. \n\n2. Ollama has server component server which you want to run on a windows machine and client you want to run on a separate machine. \n\n3. That is you propose to set global thing using a non-critical service. Please, don't mess with responsibility of between service and administrator. You're an administrator of your personal computer and you are responsible of how things should be done. \n\n4. I explained how Ollama works a few times and you probably skipped these parts. At the beginning you asked to keep windows alive per request, which would not a reasonable solution and I explained why. \n\nIf change will be per request, your single request will be finished and the next may not start and you won't be happy. Again. \n\n5. You propose how to change Ollama for your specific task, but forget that others might not want to do that and prefer to set up their systems as they expect system will behave. \n\nFor example, let's imagine your proposition has been implemented and another user installed Ollama on a laptop with Windows. Ollama per your request will drain battery as computer won't go to sleep. Or let's imagine places with high electricity bill, people won't be happy that their computer drains their money as it doesn't want to go to sleep when it supposed to.

Mention the version if possible as well.\n- [x] I carefully followed the [README.md](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/blob/master/README.md).\n- [x] I searched using keywords relevant to my issue to make sure that I am creating a new issue that is not already open (or closed).\n- [x] I reviewed the [Discussions](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/discussions), and have a new and useful enhancement to share.\n\n### Feature Description\n\nThe list of supported operation in ggml per backend is maintained at https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/blob/master/docs/ops.md\n\nHow to contribute to make the list more complete:\n\n1. Pick an operation which is not implemented in a backend (pick ones marked with ???), pick only one per PR\n2. Implement the operation\n3. Test your implementation with `test-backend-ops -o <op>`\n4. If it passes test for the op, create a PR.\n5. Mention performance tests in the PR if they exist (via `test-backend-ops perf -o <op>`)\n\nNotes:\n1. The ops suffixed with _BACK are related to training which is WIP and does not require immediate attention\n2. Do not link this issue in your PR, which will lead to closing this issue when your PR is merged. Instead, just mention it. Example PRs will be linked below\n3. This list can be temporarily out of sync, you can check support by first running `test-backend-ops -o <op>` on master to confirm \n\n\n### Motivation\n\nFeature parity between backends is always desirable and it's easy to test the implementation, making it an ideal good first issue.\n\n### Possible Implementation\n\n_No response_",

      "comments" : [ "\n\nHi! I had a look at your custom `ManchuZhMT` model.  \nThe `ValueError: You cannot specify both decoder_input_ids and decoder_inputs_embeds at the same time` comes from the fact that your `forward` always passes `decoder_input_ids` to the Marian decoder, while **Trainer + PEFT (LoRA)** may inject a `decoder_inputs_embeds` entry into `**kwargs`. When both reach the decoder, Transformers raises that validation error.\n\n**Minimal fix in your custom model:** drop one of the two before calling `self.decoder` (keeping `decoder_input_ids` is the simplest). For example:\n\n```python\ndef forward(\n    self,\n    input_ids=None,\n    attention_mask=None,\n    decoder_input_ids=None,\n    decoder_attention_mask=None,\n    labels=None,\n    **kwargs,\n):\n    ...\n    # Remove conflicting argument if both are present\n    if \"decoder_inputs_embeds\" in kwargs and decoder_input_ids is not None:\n        kwargs.pop(\"decoder_inputs_embeds\")\n\n    dec_out = self.decoder(\n        input_ids=decoder_input_ids,\n        attention_mask=decoder_attention_mask,\n        encoder_hidden_states=enc_out.last_hidden_state,\n        encoder_attention_mask=extended_mask,\n        return_dict=True,\n        **kwargs,\n    )\n    ...\n````\n\nAfter adding this guard, `trainer.train()` should run normally and produce your LoRA checkpoint.\n\nIf you prefer using embeddings explicitly, you could instead set `decoder_input_ids=None` and keep `decoder_inputs_embeds`.\n\nLet me know if you???d like a small PR adding a defensive check on the library side; happy to help adjust anything if needed. Thanks!\n\n\n", "Opened PR #39566: **Ignore `decoder_inputs_embeds` when `decoder_input_ids` are present**.\n\nIt adds a small guard in `Seq2SeqTrainer.compute_loss` and a test to prevent the `ValueError`.  \nHappy to adjust if you prefer a different location for the fix. Thanks!\n", "@JoseAlvarezMedina \nThanks for your help. I edit my `ManchuZhMT` and add `kwargs = {}` (for debug).\n**However,** The `ValueError` still exists, So I found the code in `file transformers/models/marian/modeling_marian.py, line 992`:\n```Python\n        # retrieve input_ids and inputs_embeds\n        if (input_ids is None) ^ (inputs_embeds is not None):\n            raise ValueError(\"You cannot specify both decoder_input_ids and decoder_inputs_embeds at the same time\")\n        elif input_ids is not None:\n            input = input_ids\n            input_shape = input.shape\n            input_ids = input_ids.view(-1, input_shape[-1])\n        elif inputs_embeds is not None:\n            input_shape = inputs_embeds.size()[:-1]\n            input = inputs_embeds[:, :, -1]\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(\"You have to specify either decoder_input_ids or decoder_inputs_embeds\")\n```\nBy Debugging, I found that both my `decoder_input_ids` and `decoder_inputs_embeds` is `None`, as the screenshot below:\n\n<img width=\"1692\" height=\"1313\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90baacd7-588f-4422-af88-31f46c9ae097\" />\n\nSo maybe the ValueError is caused by the process that `Seq2SeqTrainer`  generate `decoder_input_ids`, or my JSONL Loader(below)?\n```Python\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\n\nmax_len = 256\nbatch_size = 16\n\nraw_ds = load_dataset(\"json\", data_files={\"train\":\"train.jsonl\",\"val\":\"val.jsonl\"})\n\ndef tokenize(batch):\n    model_inputs = manchu_tok(\n        batch[\"source\"],\n        max_length=max_len,\n        truncation=True,\n        padding=\"max_length\"\n    )\n    with chn_tok.as_target_tokenizer():\n        labels = chn_tok(\n            batch[\"target\"],\n            max_length=max_len,\n            truncation=True,\n            padding=\"max_length\"\n        )\n    model_inputs[\"labels\"] = [\n        [(t if t != chn_tok.pad_token_id else -100) for t in label]\n        for label in labels[\"input_ids\"]\n    ]\n    return model_inputs\n\ntokenized_ds = raw_ds.map(tokenize, batched=True)\n```\nIs there any solutions?

You really have to think though BibTeX and BibLaTeX for yourself! Take this issue only if you are willing to invest significant time. ???\n\nExample: \n\n```bibtex\n@online{withDate,\n  date = {2025},\n  urldate = {2025-07-05}\n}\n\n@online{withoutDate,\n  urldate = {2025-07-05}\n}\n```\n\nIn BibTeX: Only `withDate`, field: `date` should be reported, because both entries take `urldate`.\n\nIn BibLaTeX: Only `withoutDate`, field: `date` (missing) should be reported, because required field `date` is missing.\n\n## Task\n\n- Modify `org.jabref.logic.quality.consistency.BibliographyConsistencyCheck` to use a complete `BibDatabaseContext` instead of a list of entries\n- Modify `org.jabref.logic.quality.consistency.BibliographyConsistencyCheck#check` to adhere the mode\n\n## Hints\n\n- Required fields of BibLaTeX `@online`: `org.jabref.model.entry.types.BiblatexEntryTypeDefinitions#ONLINE`\n- Get used to `org.jabref.model.entry.types.BibtexEntryTypeDefinitions` and `org.jabref.model.entry.types.BiblatexEntryTypeDefinitions`\n- One can get the required fields using `org.jabref.model.entry.BibEntryType#getRequiredFields`\n- Do test-driven development. Start with enabling `org.jabref.logic.quality.consistency.BibliographyConsistencyCheckTest#unsetFieldsReported` again.\n- Do not get confused with \"library\" and \"database\".

Therefore, users of this feature should note that specifying the pod template file only lets Spark start with a template pod instead of an empty pod during the pod-building process. For details, see the [full list](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.5.3/running-on-kubernetes.html#pod-template-properties) of pod template values that will be overwritten by spark._\r\n\r\nFor example - I personally think spark are doing a huge mistake in preventing users configuring different memory request and memory limit. It is a valid config for many use cases.\r\nWith webhook we are able to override this behavior - I have an example here which I intended to push as a part of The performance PR https://github.com/kubeflow/spark-operator/pull/1990/files, You can see the changes I did in **patch.go**\r\n\r\nIn our env where there are very high memory peaks but low memory use on average, it saved a huge over allocation and the work overhead of configuring the memory request in an efficient way per spark app.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I can't participate in the community meeting as it is impossible for my timezone, so I hope my voice will be heard here\r\n\r\n@vara-bonthu \r\n\r\n\r\n", "issue needs to be updated with the features that will be part of release 1.10", "Adding to @jacobsalway 's idea list:\n- Support for spark-history-server ", "This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity.

Start JabRef\n2. Start a LibreOffice Writer document instance\n3. Connect to the document instance from JabRef's OO/LO panel\n4. Open a new library\n5. Add the following entries to your library:\n```bibtex\n@Article{????2025,\n  author = {????},\n  title  = {You},\n  year   = {2025},\n}\n\n@Article{??2025,\n  author = {??},\n  title  = {I},\n  year   = {2025},\n}\n```\n6. Select a CSL style from the \"Select Style\" dialog of the OO/LO panel\n7. Cite any of the above entries\n8. Click the \"Make/Sync\" bibliography button from the OO/LO panel (not needed if `OO Panel->Settings->Automatically sync bibliography` is enabled)\n\nYou will observe the following exception (see appendix) along with the error dialog:\n```plain\nNo cited entries found in the document.\n```\nAnd log:\n```plain\n2025-06-10 22:32:55 [JavaFX Application Thread] org.jabref.logic.openoffice.ReferenceMark.parse()\nWARN: CSLReferenceMark: name=JABREF_????2025 CID_1 e2b1z2jv does not match pattern. Assuming random values\n```\n\n### Cause\nNon-Latin characters are not recognized valid in the \"reference marks\" format used for LO/OO in JabRef\n\n### Hints to solve\nAdapt the regex in:\nhttps://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/1ba35d20dbdd0b4aac33e1e594269d76302791b0/jablib/src/main/java/org/jabref/logic/openoffice/ReferenceMark.java#L18-L19\n\n### Pre-requisite context for people not familiar with this aspect of JabRef:\n**OO/LO integration:** https://docs.jabref.org/cite/openofficeintegration\n**CSL styles - citing and generating bibliographies:** https://blog.jabref.org/2024/08/26/GSoC-CSL/\n**\"Reference marks\" in LibreOffice:** https://devdocs.jabref.org/code-howtos/openoffice/overview.html (may be slightly outdated but conceptually valid).\n\n### Test for completion:\nScreen recording of bibliography being successfully generated in the document from the entries mentioned.\n\n### Appendix\n\n...\n<details>\n\n<summary>Log

If that is the case, I'll have to repackage the Vagrant box like I did with the (now not used) OpenSUSE 12.3 box", "I've made [a branch](https://github.com/willsparker/openjdk-infrastructure/tree/1883) that has added the Vagrantfile, along with some changes to the various scripts in VPC - these are the changes I can see initially see, but I imagine that there's going to be others.\r\n\r\nI will need to add the Vagrant box to the Machine first, as the Vagrantfile assumes that (Though, maybe this could be added to VagrantPlaybookCheck.sh` ... hmm ...). \r\n\r\nI'll run VPC once I've put that in :-) ", "https://ci.adoptopenjdk.net/job/VagrantPlaybookCheck/OS=Windows10,label=vagrant/1016/ \r\nThe first instance of the vagrant machine booting, properly. having added the Vagrant box properly. I had to do this as each user has their own copy of the vagrant box, and it was more efficient to put it in VPC then it is to manually set them up. (also helps if anyone wanted to run Windows 10 on VPC locally)", "I've come to the conclusion with multiple VPC runs, that if we want Windows 10, we shouldn't be using the MCRSFT one, as it's just too slow to boot and connect. Not sure why that is, honestly, but I have  found a few others at https://app.vagrantup.com/boxes/search?order=desc&page=1&provider=&q=windows&sort=updated&utf8=%E2%9C%93 , so I'll test those.  ", "https://ci.adoptopenjdk.net/job/VagrantPlaybookCheck/1041/OS=Windows10,label=vagrant/console\r\nIt works, using https://app.vagrantup.com/StefanScherer/boxes/windows_10 ! \r\nI'll let the playbook run through to determine if there's any issues.", "I have managed to get the WinPB running up to MSVS_2019, without any issues, but it's painfully slow on my laptop (possibly due to my having to reduce the amount of memory it uses). I'll have to run a few VPC runs to double check it works okay.", "Okay - I couldn't get a single working VPC run, without it timing out, so I'll search for a different machine.\r\n\r\nI've found https://app.vagrantup.com/peru/boxes/windows-10-enterprise-x64-eval \r\nhowever, on booting, I get the following error message: \r\n```\r\n#<Vagrant::Errors::VBoxManageError: There was an error while executing `VBoxManage`, a CLI used by Vagrant\r\nfor controlling VirtualBox. The command and stderr is shown below.\r\n\r\nCommand: [\"modifyvm\", \"f32d833e-959f-4491-b172-dc254b2c83f3\", \"--clipboard-mode\", \"bidirectional\"]\r\n...\r\nVBoxManage: error: Unknown option: --clipboard-mode\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is due to my laptop having VirtualBox v6.0 on it, not 6.1. I'd rather not bump the requirement up to 6.1 for VPC stuff, if I can avoid it (considering we know all our other VFs work with 6.0), but it is an option.", "Okay, I found an alternative VF, that is more lightweight (https://app.vagrantup.com/xnohat/boxes/windows10lite). I've managed to make it boot _fairly_ often. It appears around 1 out of 4 runs, the following error occurs:\r\n```\r\n==> adoptopenjdkW2012: Waiting for machine to reboot...\r\nAn error occurred executing a remote WinRM command.\r\n\r\nShell: Powershell\r\nCommand: # Function to check whether machine is currently shutting down\r\nfunction ShuttingDown {\r\n    [string]$sourceCode = @\"\r\nusing System;\r\nusing System.Runtime.InteropServices;\r\n\r\nnamespace Vagrant {\r\n    public static class RemoteManager {\r\n        private const int SM_SHUTTINGDOWN = 0x2000;\r\n\r\n...

The forwarded port to 33899 is already in use\r\n07:37:12 on the host machine.\r\n07:37:12 \r\n07:37:12 To fix this, modify your current project's Vagrantfile to use another\r\n07:37:12 port. Example, where '1234' would be replaced by a unique host port:\r\n07:37:12 \r\n07:37:12   config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 3389, host: 1234\r\n07:37:12 \r\n07:37:12 Sometimes, Vagrant will attempt to auto-correct this for you. In this\r\n07:37:12 case, Vagrant was unable to. This is usually because the guest machine\r\n07:37:12 is in a state which doesn't allow modifying port forwarding. You could\r\n07:37:12 try 'vagrant reload' (equivalent of running a halt followed by an up)\r\n07:37:12 so vagrant can attempt to auto-correct this upon booting. Be warned\r\n07:37:12 that any unsaved work might be lost.\r\n```\r\nI believe this is due to the VM being run on a different User on the machine - once that one is closed, it works fine. Not sure of the issue, or a workaround - but I'll look around some other boxes. ", "The overarching issue I've found with Windows 10 boxes, is that they all seem to be very large and are difficult for Vagrant to boot, and if they're not, they are configured in a quirky way - such as the comments above. For now, I'm going to leave this while I figure out an alternative to a Vagrant Box (i.e. build my own box ... )", "Based on Will's experience this may be a difficult task, but adding `good first issue` in case someone wants to take it on. It should be possible for anyone with a machin able to run `vagrant` to at least take a look at it.", "We probably want this to be Windows 11 now", "We've got Windows server 2022 in there now. Tagging @steelhead31 for awareness since he's been setting up some different distributions. We could potentially add Windows 11 in place of Server 2012 now." ],

So the annotation was never on the field in the first place. While the Java syntax is not clear here (for backwards compatibility I guess), the JSpecify `@Nullable` is not applicable to fields. So we could in any case update the recipe to exclude moving annotations which don't support the `FIELD` element type.\n\nConversely, when an annotation type doesn't support the `TYPE_USE` target, I am unsure if we should move it. Even if it is moved to before the field type, it will still be a field annotation and I think it would look a bit strange to have it appear after any modifiers.\n\nFinally, we could consider only moving leading annotations, as I suspect that any annotations appearing after a modifier are meant to be TYPE_USE.

      "comments" : [ "<!-- Answer -->\nThis is a known issue: when switching from a multimodal to a non-multimodal model, the UI hides the file type switches but does not automatically reset the `file_upload.allowed_file_types` parameter. This happens because the frontend manages this parameter and currently lacks logic to clean up unsupported file types when the model changes. The backend does not enforce or recalculate this either, so stale values can persist in your config, as you observed.\n\nThere is no built-in workaround to automatically fix this after switching models. As a temporary manual fix, you can toggle the file upload switches (if visible) to remove unsupported types, or edit the configuration directly if possible.\n\nFor a robust solution, the code should be updated so that when the model changes, the allowed file types are reset to match the new model's capabilities. The best place to add this logic is in the model switching handler (such as the `setModel` function in the main configuration component or the `onChange` handler in the model picker), immediately after a model switch. This would ensure the UI and config always stay in sync with the selected model's features. See the relevant code and explanation [here](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/blob/bd5b9385719e642cad37c32e725ca8846b8d192d/web/app/components/app/configuration/index.tsx) and [here](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/blob/bd5b9385719e642cad37c32e725ca8846b8d192d/web/app/components/app/configuration/config/assistant-type-picker/index.tsx).\n\nUntil this is fixed, avoid switching from multimodal to non-multimodal models if you need the file upload config to be accurate, or manually clear the unsupported types after switching.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

I haven't explicitly experienced any dependency conflict issues with your package no because we only depend on openai and anthropic right now, but you did break our tracing when we installed you, and the API of your package isn't fully composable (it doesn't separate side effecting calls from pure functions)\n\nEdit 2: I would never in my life install an auto-instrumentation package from OT ??? the moment anything isn't working you're ****ed and have no idea where and what to investigate.", "Hi @nirga \nI would love to contribute to this, can I give it a shot?", "Of course @shabb-ir!" ],

(You can include a screenshot if it helps explain)\n\nIf you (for some reason, a bit corner casy) have an ensemble with \"all finished\" realizations, and try to run the \"evaluate ensemble\" on it, you have to specify (no default) in the \"Active Realizations\" (rename suggested in https://github.com/equinor/ert/issues/11155) \n\nWhen the experiment/simulation is finished, this fields gets updated again (with blank values) and there is a validation error that shows \"through\" to the simulation panel/window. \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ad4b8b5-2dd3-421c-bf3c-29e3a853f3f3)\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\nEither set \"all\" (eg. 0.-99) as default or don't show the validation error unless you actually interact with the \"start simulation\" panel again. Should perhaps fix the latter in any case, but a suggestion of setting the prefilled values to \"all\" is in this case discussed and kind of agreed with @dafeda and @oyvindeide \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n```Python\n\n```\n\n### Environment where bug has been observed\n\n- [ ] Python 3.11\n- [ ] Python 3.12\n- [ ] macOS\n- [ ] RHEL8\n- [ ] RHEL9\n- [ ] Local queue\n- [ ] LSF queue\n- [ ] Slurm queue\n- [ ] OpenPBS queue",

See https://medium.com/@stefanos.kalandaridis/bash-ing-your-network-f7069ab7c5f4 for a decent primer on how it works.\r\n\r\nThis is among the weakest of healthcheck options in that it simply verifies that SOMETHING is able to accept a tcp connection on the API port. It says nothing about the health of the gRPC stack or any in-memory or on-disk state. It also says nothing about DERP, which could maybe be interrogated via `/dev/udp` but doing so requires knowing a valid message to send that will elicit a response and not leak resources along the way. I haven't configured a derp check myself.\r\n\r\nThis isn't a high-quality replacement for the stronger checks proposed in other comments... but it's start that allows monitoring frameworks to check that the API is at least healthy enough to complete a 3-way TCP handshake in image-flavors that have bash available.", "> This enables using /dev/tcp to check if the API port is open via something like (assuming you're using the default API port): `bash -c 'cat < /dev/null > /dev/tcp/localhost/8080'`\n\nNo **bash** nor **sh** in `headscale/headscale:v0.25`", "What I saw in other go programs is a health check made in main of the go program.\nSo you can make use of http client.", "Hey all.

You???re now officially **assigned** to this issue under the **GSSoC'25** program. \uD83C\uDFAF???\n\n---\n\n### \uD83C\uDFAF Objective:\n\nCreate a feature that allows users on **DevElevate** to easily access **DSA-specific problems** within the **Programming** section ??? filtered and served via a dedicated backend API, then displayed on the frontend.\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDCCC Implementation Requirements:\n\n#### 1. \uD83E\uDDE0 **Database (MongoDB Atlas add it here it will store the data after you test it in local host that it is storing the data add this to store online ok - MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<your-username>:<your-password>@cluster0.0khgj.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0\n\n\n* Use the `problems` or `programmingContent` collection (as per project structure).\n* Tag each document related to DSA with a `category: \"DSA\"` or `tags: [\"dsa\"]`.\n* Sample schema:\n\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"_id\": \"...\",\n    \"title\": \"Two Sum\",\n    \"difficulty\": \"Easy\",\n    \"category\": \"DSA\",\n    \"tags\": [\"array\", \"hashmap\"],\n    \"link\": \"https://...\",\n    \"createdAt\": \"...\"\n  }\n  ```\n\n#### 2. \uD83D\uDD27 **Backend (Node.js + Express)**\n\n* Create a **new GET endpoint**:\n\n  ```\n  GET /api/programming/dsa\n  ```\n\n* Logic:\n\n  * Fetch problems where `category === \"DSA\"` or contains `\"dsa\"` in tags.\n  * Return essential fields like title, id, difficulty, and link.\n\n* Example response:\n\n  ```json\n  [\n    {\n      \"_id\": \"1\",\n      \"title\": \"Two Sum\",\n      \"difficulty\": \"Easy\",\n      \"link\": \"https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum\"\n    },\n    ...\n  ]\n  ```\n\n#### 3. \uD83D\uDCBB **Frontend (React + Vite)**\n\n* Add a **filter option** in the Programming section: `View DSA Problems`.\n* When clicked, call the new API and display only DSA-tagged content.\n* Display in grid/list with:\n\n  * ??? Problem name\n  * ??? Difficulty tag (e.g. Easy/Medium/Hard)\n  * ??? External link or solve now button\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDCC4 Documentation\n\n* Please document:\n\n  * The new API endpoint\n  * Any schema field changes or added tags\n  * How contributors can add new DSA questions in future\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDEA8 Important:\n\n* \uD83D\uDD10 Secure the endpoint (if needed for authenticated users).\n* \uD83E\uDDEA Test thoroughly on `localhost` before pushing.\n* ??? DO NOT remove or break existing Programming section functionality.\n\n\n\uD83D\uDEA8 Important Reminder Before You Start! \uD83D\uDEA8\n\nHey folks \uD83D\uDC4B,\n\n\uD83D\uDCA1 Always make sure to pull the latest changes from the main branch before you start working on your feature or bug fix!\nThis helps you avoid merge conflicts and keeps your work in sync with the current codebase. ???\n\n\uD83D\uDD04 Steps to follow:\n\n1?????? Switch to your local branch\n2?????? Run: git pull origin main ??????\n3?????? Then start working on your issue \uD83D\uDCBB???\n\n\uD83D\uDE80 When you're done and ready to push:\n\n4?????? Run: git pull origin main again to make sure it's still up-to-date\n5?????? Resolve any small conflicts (if any) \uD83D\uDD27\n6?????? Then push your work: git push origin your-branch-name \uD83D\uDCE4\n\nThis keeps the project clean, conflict-free, and easier to merge! \uD83D\uDCAF\n\nLooking forward to your amazing contributions \uD83D\uDCBB??? ??? let???s build something truly impactful together! \uD83D\uDE80\uD83D\uDD25\n\nKeep innovating, keep elevating! \uD83C\uDF1F\uD83D\uDCA1\n\n???

      "description" : "### Component(s)\n\nexporter/kafka\n\n### What happened?\n\n## Description\nAt the `kafkaexporter` is using `BaseExporter.TimeoutSettings` to set timeout for both Sarama and Franz produces.\nSee [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/exporter/kafkaexporter/kafka_exporter.go#L106) and [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/exporter/kafkaexporter/kafka_exporter.go#L119)\nThis approach works fine with the basic `kafkaexporter` usage with some defaults, for example using such config:\n```\n      kafka:\n        protocol_version: \"3.5.0\"\n        brokers:\n          - ...\n        timeout: 5s\n        producer:\n          max_message_bytes: 999999\n          flush_max_messages: 0\n          compression: gzip\n          required_acks: 1\n```\nIn this case internal `BaseExporter` pipeline will look like this:\n```\ntimeout_sender(5s) -> obs_report_sender -> kafka_client(with same timeout 5s)\n```\n\nBut, in case of usage of `BaseExporter.RetrySender` in pipeline configuration becomes unreliable.\nFor example, using such config:\n```\n      kafka:\n        protocol_version: \"3.5.0\"\n        brokers:\n          - ...\n        timeout: 5s\n        retry_on_failure:\n          enabled: true\n          initial_interval: 5s\n          max_interval: 10s\n          max_elapsed_time: 1m\n        producer:\n          max_message_bytes: 999999\n          flush_max_messages: 0\n          compression: gzip\n          required_acks: 1\n```\nIn this case internal `BaseExporter` pipeline will look like this:\n```\ntimeout_sender(5s) -> retry_sender(max timeout 1m) -> obs_report_sender -> kafka_client(with same timeout 5s)\n```\nAnd, obviously, `retry_sender` will not work correctly in this case as `timeout_sender` will stop pipeline in 5 seconds of timeout, while we expect to retry failures up to 1 minute.\nChanging `timeout` setting to `1m` will also change the timeout for Kafka Producer which is an unexpected change for this pipeline\n\nAlso this configuration approach does not allow to disable `timeout_sender` (by setting `timeout: 0`) because `Producer.Timeout` requires timeout to be non-zero\n\n## Expected Result\nExporter itself (BaseExporter) and Kafka Producer should have separate timeout configurations for proper exporter tuning in all allowed cases\n\n## Actual Result\nExporter itself (BaseExporter) and Kafka Producer are using same timeout configuration, which prevent correct work of `retry_sender`\n\n\n### Collector version\n\nv0.130.0\n\n### Tip\n\n<sub>[React](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) with \uD83D\uDC4D to help prioritize this issue.

Than I believe it should work as expected.\nThe only thing - we should adjust documentation than, because it doesn't reflect this code \"magic\" and confusing advanced users who are expecting this timeout to be for whole exporter\nSee https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/exporter/kafkaexporter/README.md?plain=1#L86", "Fair enough, I think we can clarify the documentation.\n\nThat was likely based on https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/exporter/exporterhelper/README.md#exporter-helper, which is a bit generic. We can probably make this clearer by stating that the timeout applies to a single attempt to produce to Kafka. Maybe:\n\n```yaml\n- `timeout` (default = 5s): Time to wait per individual attempt to produce data to Kafka.\n```\n\nIs that clear enough?" ],

It might make sense to translate the homepage above the fold early, but leave the rest for later. As individual pages get translated, you can change the page titles in the corresponding sidebar files. Finally, when you're translating the navigation, make sure to test both desktop and mobile layouts.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Homepage (currently in `HomeContent.js`)\r\n- [ ] Sidebars (currently in `src/sidebar*.json`)\r\n- [ ] Top-level navigation (currently in `TopNav.tsx`)\r\n\r\n### When You're Ready...\r\n\r\nAfter everything above is translated, add your language to `deployedLanguages` in `Seo.tsx` of the original [reactjs/react.dev](https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev) repository.\r\n\r\n## Secondary Content <!-- SECONDARY_CONTENT -->\r\n\r\nThese API pages should ideally be translated too, but they're less urgent and can be done after the others:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Legacy React APIs\r\n  - [ ] `Children`\r\n  - [ ] `cloneElement`\r\n  - [ ] `Component`\r\n  - [ ] `createElement`\r\n  - [ ] `createFactory`\r\n  - [ ] `createRef`\r\n  - [ ] `isValidElement`\r\n  - [ ] `PureComponent`\r\n\r\n## Optional Content <!-- OPTIONAL_CONTENT -->\r\n\r\nThese aren't the main translation targets, but if you'd like to do them, feel free to expand the list to include their subpages:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Community\r\n- [ ] Blog\r\n- [ ] Warnings\r\n",

Let's work on solving this issue together.\n\n<!-- Answer -->\nTo resolve the \"plugin_unique_identifier is not valid\" error in the docker-plugin_daemon-1 logs, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Execute these SQL commands in the dify_plugin database to clear any invalid plugin entries:\n   ```sql\n   delete from plugin_installations where plugin_unique_identifier is not null;\n   delete from plugin_declarations where plugin_unique_identifier is not null;\n   delete from ai_model_installations where plugin_unique_identifier is not null;\n   delete from plugins where plugin_unique_identifier is not null;\n   ```\n\n2. Clear the following plugin directories to remove any corrupted or invalid plugin data:\n   - `/app/storage/cwd/plugins/plugin`\n   - `/app/storage/cwd/plugins/plugin-working`\n   - `/app/storage/cwd/plugins/persistence`\n   - `/app/storage/cwd/plugins/plugin-root`\n\n3. Update the `manifest.yaml` file and any `.yaml` files under the `/provider` path in your plugin project to ensure the `author` field is set to your GitHub ID.\n\n4. Repackage the plugin and reinstall it to ensure all configurations are correct.\n\n5. Restart the plugin daemon service to apply the changes.\n\nThese steps should help resolve the error and the resulting \"Internal Server Error\" when editing models in the workflow <sup>[[1]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/14918)</sup><sup>[[2]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify-docs/blob/main/jp/plugins/faq.md)</sup>.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To continue talking to [Dosu](https://dosu.dev), mention @dosu.*\n\n---\n<sup>Help Dosu learn!

Run `npx oauth2-mock-server -p 53485`\n2. In your React app that uses @auth0/auth0-react try to login using login provider\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nUser is successfully logged in and there is no token error\n\n## Environment\n\n- `oauth2-mock-server` version: 8.1.0\n- Noje.JS version: 20.19.3\n- NPM version: 10.8.2\n- Operating System: MacOS\n\n## Additional Context\n\n### Workaround\nAs a workaround I had to manually create and start the server\n```\n  const oauth2Server = new OAuth2Server();\n  const loginProviderHost = \"http://localhost:53485\";\n\n  // Configure with trailing slash in issuer URL\n  oauth2Server.issuer.url = `${loginProviderHost}/`;\n\n  await oauth2Server.issuer.keys.generate(\"RS256\");\n\n  const [port] = loginProviderHost.split(\":\").slice(-1);\n  await oauth2Server.start(parseInt(port));\n```\n\nThe default URL is built [here](https://github.com/axa-group/oauth2-mock-server/blob/bacf8c6af265381bb1f5055b7094d3f94422dda2/src/lib/http-server.ts#L119) clearly without trailing slash so maybe it is expected behavior and works fine with other libraries. If this a case this can be converted into the feature to allow setting issuer from CLI as well as from the code",

Would you feel like sending a pull request to allow the issuer override through a cli param?\n\n@Valdermeyder I've started to work on this.\n\nHowever, after a bit of thinking, I believe this cli param should not be about replacing the issuer, but rather offering the possibility to optionally add a trailing slash to the generated issuer.\n\nThoughts? ", "@nulltoken sorry, for not responding. Adding a slash at the can be a solution for my specific issue but it will not cover the same what we can do in code. In code we can set any issuer we want, however I don't know how everything works under the hood so maybe there is a bigger impact." ],
