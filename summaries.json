      "description" : "### Apache Airflow Provider(s)\n\nhttp\n\n### Versions of Apache Airflow Providers\n\n5.3.0\n\n### Apache Airflow version\n\n3.0.2\n\n### Operating System\n\nUbuntu 24.04.2 LTS\n\n### Deployment\n\nVirtualenv installation\n\n### Deployment details\n\n- **Deployment Type**: Virtualenv installation\n- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS\n- **Python Version**: 3.12.3\n- **Airflow Version**: 3.0.2\n- **HTTP Provider Version**: 5.3.0\n- **Database Backend**: PostgreSQL 16\n- **Secrets Backend**: Microsoft Azure Key Vault\n- **Authentication**: Flask AppBuilder (FAB) with Microsoft Entra ID (SSO)\n- **SSL Configuration**: Enabled with custom certificates\n- **Timezone**: Pacific/Auckland\n- **Airflow Services Management**: systemd unit files for `api-server`, `scheduler`, `dag-processor`, and `triggerer`\n- **Custom Configuration Highlights**:\n  - Airflow configuration (`airflow.cfg`) includes:\n    - `sql_alchemy_conn_secret` for DB connection string\n    - Azure Key Vault integration for secrets\n    - SSL cert/key paths\n    - FAB auth manager\n  - Environment variables for Azure credentials (`AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`)\n  - Custom `webserver_config.py` for SSO\n  - Firewall configured to allow port 8443\n\n### What happened\n\nI encountered an issue while using a deferrable `HttpSensor` in Airflow 3.0.2. The sensor is configured to use a connection (`https_host-has-no-schema`) with the following details:\n\n- **Host**: `dummyjson.com`\n- **Port**: `443`\n- **Schema**: `https`\n\nDuring the initial execution, the sensor correctly uses `HttpHook` to send a GET request to `https://dummyjson.com:443/fake_endpoint`, receives a 404 response, and defers the task as expected.\n\nHowever, when the deferred task resumes via `HttpSensorTrigger`, the trigger internally creates an `HttpAsyncHook` object. This hook retrieves the connection using `self.get_connection(self.http_conn_id)` but appears to lose the `schema` value. As a result, the final request URL becomes `http://dummyjson.com:443/fake_endpoint`, which is incorrect and causes unexpected behavior.\n\nThis discrepancy between `HttpHook` and `HttpAsyncHook` in handling the connection schema seems to stem from how the connection object is retrieved and interpreted asynchronously. The issue may involve `BaseHook.get_connection`, `Connection`, or `TaskSDKConnection` not properly preserving or propagating the `schema` field.\n\nHere’s a log fragment showing the incorrect behavior. The first request `https` but the second request is `http`.\n```log\n[2025-06-27, 01:46:26] INFO - Connection Retrieved 'https_host-has-no-schema': source=\"airflow.hooks.base\"\n[2025-06-27, 01:46:26] DEBUG - Connection Details: 'Connection(conn_id='https_host-has-no-schema', conn_type='http', description=None, host='dummyjson.com', schema='https', login=None, password=None, port=443, extra=None)': source=\"airflow.hooks.base\"\n[2025-06-27, 01:46:26] DEBUG - Sending 'GET' to url: https://dummyjson.com:443/fake_endpoint: source=\"airflow.task.hooks.airflow.providers.http.hooks.http.HttpHook\"\n......\n[2025-06-27, 01:46:31] INFO - Connection Retrieved 'https_host-has-no-schema': source=\"airflow.hooks.base\"\n[2025-06-27, 01:46:31] DEBUG - Connection Details: 'Connection(conn_id='https_host-has-no-schema', conn_type='http', description=None, host='dummyjson.com', schema=None, login=None, password=None, port=443, extra=None)': source=\"airflow.hooks.base\"\n[2025-06-27, 01:46:31] WARNING - [Try 1 of 3] Request to http://dummyjson.com:443/fake_endpoint failed.: source=\"airflow.providers.http.hooks.http.HttpAsyncHook\"\n```\n\n### What you think should happen instead\n\nThe expected behavior is that both HttpHook and HttpAsyncHook should consistently respect the schema field defined in the Airflow connection. In this case, the connection https_host-has-no-schema explicitly sets schema=https, so all HTTP requests — synchronous or asynchronous — should use https:// in the final URL.\n\n### How to reproduce\n\n1. **Create an Airflow connection** named `https_host-has-no-schema` with the following settings:\n   - **Host**: `dummyjson.com`\n   - **Port**: `443`\n   - **Schema**: `https`\n   - Leave login, password, and extra fields empty.\n\n2. **Create a DAG** with the following code:\n\n   ```python\n   from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n   from airflow import DAG\n   from airflow.providers.http.sensors.http import HttpSensor\n   from airflow.providers.http.operators.http import HttpOperator\n\n   with DAG(\n       dag_id=\"dag_reproduce_issue\",\n       description=\"Reproduce\",\n       start_date=datetime.now() - timedelta(days=1),\n       schedule=None,\n       catchup=False,\n       default_args={\n           \"retries\": 0,\n           \"retry_delay\": timedelta(minutes=1),\n       },\n       tags=[\"reproduce_issue\"],\n   ) as dag:\n\n       https_operator = HttpOperator(\n           task_id=\"https_operator\",\n           http_conn_id=\"https_host-has-no-schema\",\n           endpoint=\"products\",\n           method=\"GET\",\n       )\n\n       https_sensor = HttpSensor(\n           task_id=\"https_sensor\",\n           http_conn_id=\"https_host-has-no-schema\",\n           endpoint=\"fake_endpoint\",\n           method=\"GET\",\n           deferrable=True,\n           poke_interval=30,\n           timeout=60,\n       )\n\n       https_operator >> https_sensor\n   ```\n\n3. **Run the DAG**. Observe the following:\n   - `https_operator` sends a request to `https://dummyjson.com:443/products` and succeeds.\n   - `https_sensor` initially sends a request to `https://dummyjson.com:443/fake_endpoint`, receives a 404, and defers.\n   - When resumed by `HttpSensorTrigger`, the request is sent to `http://dummyjson.com:443/fake_endpoint` instead of `https`.\n\n4. **Check the logs** of the triggerer process to confirm the incorrect URL schema.\n\n### Anything else\n\nThis issue occurs **every time** under the following conditions:\n\n- The Airflow connection's **host** field does **not include a URL schema** (i.e., no `http://` or `https://`).\n- The **schema** field in the connection is explicitly set to `https`.\n- The `HttpSensor` is set to `deferrable=True`. I did not test when `deferrable=False`.\n\nUnder these conditions, the `HttpAsyncHook` used by `HttpSensorTrigger` fails to apply the `https` schema and defaults to `http`, resulting in incorrect request URLs.\n\nHowever, if the host is set to `https://dummyjson.com` (i.e., includes the schema directly in the host field), the issue does **not** occur. In that case, both the host and port are correctly loaded and used by `HttpAsyncHook`.\n\nTo better observe this behavior, it is recommended to enable **DEBUG logging level** in Airflow. This will show the full request URL constructed by the hook and confirm whether the schema is being applied correctly.\n\n### Are you willing to submit PR?\n\n- [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n",

I don't think this is documented anywhere. Here are the main steps:\n\n1\\. First compile the dependency module with `mymodule.swift -emit-library -o /path/to/mymodule.dylib -emit-module-path /path/to/swiftmoduledir/`.  \n2. Compile the executable with `swiftc mymainmodule.swift -emit-object -o /path/to/mymainmodule.o -I /path/to/swiftmoduledir/`  \n3. Link with `swiftc /path/to/mymainmodule.o /path/to/mymodule.dylib -emit-executable -o /path/to/myexe`  \n4. Run the executable normally, or optionally with the new runtime `env DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/libswiftCore.dylib /path/to/myexe`.\n\nOn Linux, the file suffixes would be different (do we support dynamic linking on Linux?), and I imagine replacing DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH with LD_LIBRARY_PATH should just work.\n\nYou can also import a module directory (i.e. containing a `module.modulemap`) with `-I`, or directly import a header `-import-objc-header`.\n\nWe should probably document some examples of invoking swiftc in the help page (right now, it has no examples ❗), and this could be the final example (and the most complicated one). the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH bit is for development, so it's not super clear where we should write that down, but it's not necessarily obvious to a contributor that the locally built compiler compiler links in the OS runtime by default and not the locally built one.\n\nOne potential idea is to have simple example in `--help`, which would a subset of a new document under the `docs/` directory. We can link the document from the `--help` page, so someone can follow it in case they want more complicated examples. The DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH \"trick\" can go into the doc without going into the `--help` information. If we create this new doc, we should also link it from `docs/DebuggingTheCompiler.md`.\n\n\n   ",

I guess in theory if we're really careful about the lookup logic (and the KVStore is async) we could do the loading in parallel (though its still a few more requests) but we'd still have to wait on compaction (without a background-compaction task running, which would require a generic `spawn` method...). Seems much easier to just check the length and skip some code for the common case :)", "If I understand it correctly, this is special casing for channels at the beginning of their life and when they grow, the node will switch over to persisting updates and compaction anyway?\n\nTo me it isn't quite clear if this is really worth it. If the hit is significant, it is also a problem when the channel has outgrown the 'small' stage anyway?", "> If I understand it correctly, this is special casing for channels at the beginning of their life and when they grow, the node will switch over to persisting updates and compaction anyway?\n\nYes.\n\n> To me it isn't quite clear if this is really worth it. If the hit is significant, it is also a problem when the channel has outgrown the 'small' stage anyway?\n\nIts more a recognition of two very different cases - if you're running an \"edge node\" that is just a wallet making occasional payments, then you're likely to never hit the \"large\" stage, and thus avoiding the compaction overhead is a really nice optimization. If you're a larger node that is forwarding/processing many payments, you're very likely to hit the \"large\" stage and the compaction penalty is worth it to avoid the writes.", "At what size would the \"large\" stage be entered then typically and how many htlcs/channel updates is that? A channel monitor of a few kb, that doesn't sound like all that many updates?", "Yea, dunno, we'd have to figure that out. I imagine most mobile nodes probably make in the 100s to low 1000s of payments in their entire lifetime, probably fewer on a single channel once you consider splicing and the like. 10KiB or whatever should be plenty for 100 or 250 payments.", "> Its more a recognition of two very different cases\n\nIt sounds like if you wanted to make this automatic, the metric you'd really want to evaluate to switch this behavior isn't so much monitor size, as one of these:\n\n  - Frequency of updates to the channel\n  - Latency of updates to the channel (more difficult)\n\nThe monitor size is a decent reflection of the _number_ of updates to the channel[1], but with no perception of time it's impossible to evaluate whether it's being stored by a tenured edge node, or a routing node. I think if you took time into account, perhaps by using the block delta between the funding tx and chain tip to estimate update frequency, you could make a more informed assessment.\n\nHowever, I worry that automating the behavior selection is not really following the \"principle of least astonishment.\" \n\nI would think that routing nodes rarely move to the edge, and edge nodes rarely become routing nodes (more often, a routing node starts small and may appear like an edge). And furthermore, I know what my node is likely to be; especially if I'm a Lightning developer and managing this on behalf of users, such as in a mobile wallet.\n\nFor that matter, varying the behavior _per channel_ seems to make node persistence more difficult to reason about. Different channels could persist different ways on my node, depending on a size threshold. Which means they can change without me doing anything. I would think that if the reason for variation is the use case, then one behavior is correct for all channels stored by the node.\n\nIn that light, I'd just leave this a configurable behavior, which I think it is now.\n\n[1] I recognize that size is being used here to evaluate the storage write size, not the number of updates. But I think that is why the discussion is unclear. Compared to update count/frequency, it's much harder to know the storage configuration of a given node, and what the throughput/latency tradeoff is like.", "I think the intent of the proposed change is to optimize for the edge-node case with remote storage. Even an edge node may make enough payments to get a monitor up to 10s of KiB in size, at which point network-level effects like TCP slowstart may dominate the actual network latency. For a \"power-user\" edge node, we really want to use the `MonitorUpdatingPersister`, but paying the extra RTT cost of cleanup on load for every edge node is not a great tradeoff either.\n\nFor a routing node, it still seems to me like a size-based threshold may be something they want, purely as it (very marginally) reduces IO throughput for under-utilized or new channels. Writing out updates (padded to 4KiB or more depending on the storage medium) and then consolidating when the whole monitor is only a few KiB isn't really the right tradeoff no matter what. Of course a routing node is expected to surpass the threshold very quickly, so it shouldn't really make a substantial difference, but it seems strictly better to write out full updates in this case than not.\n\nIndeed, this does lead to a bit of behavior shift, but I think the important metrics wouldn't change - first of all, if you happened to look at storage right after compaction, the stored contents would be identical to a full monitor persistence so I wouldn't really say that this materially changes the way that logic would interact with the stored data (you already have to handle the case of having no in-flight updates!). It also shouldn't materially change the IO throughput or write count for any node, just a fairly marginal strict reduction for routing nodes with fresh channels.", "> At what size would the \"large\" stage be entered then typically and how many htlcs/channel updates is that? A channel monitor of a few kb, that doesn't sound like all that many updates?\n\nFor our probing node running ldk-node with network storage (EFS), at around 20,000 updates over the single channel the average probe duration starts to increase substantially. p75 starts to creep up after about 3,000.", "Do y'all have any further thoughts here, @domZippilli or @amackillop?" ],

Do we want to group safety with intersections or with transportation? Arguably the intersections are a type of safety callout, but perhaps the point of separating the intersection callout toggle is to allow everything except intersections to continue being called out.", "That's a great point :-) Perhaps we split out all 3 separately? All the other Callout options are quite binary whereas this one currently incorporates 3 different types...so splitting them out will allow a person to fine-tune the information they wish to hear. It will increase the panel and require more scrolling for the page...but I think it's worth doing. ", "\nI could also argue that the safety spots callout should remain on unless the user decides to turn all callouts off. In the early days of Microsoft Soundscape, there used to be a toggle switch for the Location Updates callout, but starting around the early 2020's,the Location Updates callout became permanently turned on and cannot directly be configured by the user. My argument to leave safety spots on is so that the user is always aware of anything hazardous while walking around. That way the \"Manage Callouts\" menu wouldn't be cluttered with too many configurations. If we decide to go ahead with my solution, I also wrote a revision to the help documentation explaining \"Note: some callouts essential for safe navigation do not have their own toggle switch and can only be disabled with the \"Allow Callouts\" button.\" Anyway, having all three callouts in this section or just Transportation and Intersections will be an improvement, even for sighted users.

This way BigQuery can be used as a source of truth for these values.\r\n\r\nOther database drivers could then follow a similar model, for example Postgres has comment fields which can be expected to have the same structured JSON message if the driver is switched to propagate Data Model annotations from the source system table metadata.\r\n\r\nIs this a good proposal?

Policies are defined in YAML and \nsent over gRPC to the local KubeArmor agent.\n\nSubcommands:                                                                                 <- content of long description\n  • add     Apply a new policy from a YAML file (kubearmor vm policy add <file>)\n  • delete  Remove an existing policy by its YAML file (kubearmor vm policy delete <file>)\n\nGlobal Flags:                                                                                 <- content of long description\n  • --gRPC <address>   Address of the KubeArmor gRPC server (host:port)\n\nExamples:\n  # Apply a file‑access policy on a standalone host:\n  karmor vm policy add ./file-access.yaml --gRPC 127.0.0.1:50051\n\n  # Remove that policy when finished:\n  karmor vm policy delete ./file-access.yaml --gRPC 127.0.0.1:50051\n\nSee each subcommand's help for more details:\n  karmor vm policy add --help\n  karmor vm policy delete --help\n\nUsage:\n  karmor vm policy [command]\n\nAvailable Commands:                                                                            <- generated by Cobra\n  add         add policy for non kubernetes/bare metal KubeArmor\n  delete      delete policy for non kubernetes/bare metal KubeArmor\n  get         get policy for bare-metal vm/kvms control plane vm\n\nFlags:                                                                                         <- generated by Cobra\n      --gRPC string   gRPC server information\n  -h, --help          help for policy\n\nGlobal Flags:                                                                                  <- generated by Cobra\n      --context string      Name of the kubeconfig context to use\n      --kubeconfig string   Path to the kubeconfig file to use\n\nUse \"karmor vm policy [command] --help\" for more information about a command.\n```\nManually added Long description currently contains:\n\n- Description of command\n- Subcommands: add, delete, etc.\n- Global Flags: --gRPC, etc.\n- Example Usage\n\nThese are also automatically rendered by Cobra, making their inclusion in Long unnecessary. We only need Description and Example Usage\n\n## Proposed Change:\nRefactor the Long descriptions for CLI commands to contain only:\n\n- Command overview\n- Example for usage\n\nRemove manually added subcommands and global flags from the long description.\n\nThis will ensure the CLI help remains clean, DRY, and easier to maintain.\n\nThanks!",

The X axis only shows periods present in the query result, so if the last month is missing from your chart, it's probably not included in the query output. This can happen if the time range end boundary is exclusive or if the SQL time grain logic doesn't generate a row for the last month.\n\nThere have been recent fixes that may help: one ensures all x-axis date labels for the selected time grain are displayed ([PR 33191](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/33191)), and another adds an option to show all X axis ticks on timeseries charts ([PR 33729](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/33729)). Make sure your deployment includes these changes and try enabling the new X axis tick display option if it's available.\n\nIf the issue persists, check the SQL generated for your chart to confirm the last month is included in the result set. Adjusting the time range or time grain settings may help. If you need the last month to appear even when there is no data, you would need to pad missing periods in your dataset or adjust the backend query to generate all expected periods, as the frontend does not do this automatically.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

The backend time grain logic (including \"month\") is handled in `superset/db_engine_specs/base.py` [[source]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/2e9939baf253e607a54722b1996baaf625e72133/superset/db_engine_specs/base.py).\n\nTo fix this, check the SQL generated for your chart and make sure the last month is included in the result set. If your time range is exclusive at the end, try making it inclusive. If you want the last month to appear even when there is no data, you’ll need to pad missing periods in the backend query (e.g., generate a series of all expected months and left join your data onto it). There isn’t a built-in frontend option to do this automatically.\n\nIf you want to explore a frontend solution, you’d need to modify the logic in `extractSeries` to inject missing periods, but this is usually best handled on the backend for consistency across all visualizations.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

Do you know how I can approach that?\r\n\r\nAlso correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems the intention of the ticket is the following: \r\n1) Application (Managing Appprojects) - Gets a Delete request from CLI,UI, etc.\r\n2) Application - Gets a finalizer/enters deleting state, and then starts processing it's live objects \r\n3) AppProject Deletion - Gets a finalizer/enters deleting state \r\n4) Check for Apps - Check to see if any apps reference the AppProject\r\n- If yes, skip removing finalizer + skip deletion\r\n- If no, remove finalizer + delete project\r\n\r\nFYI, I'm sure I'm slightly incorrect on some of the above details, but let me know. Thanks!!!", "Nvm, I managed to figure out/resolve the issue.

Basically, a project being removed from Pruning. Writing the e2e will allow you to test the scenarios and will also be useful to validate the implementation.\n\nI think this code will not be reached since the resource wont have a finalizer added to it.

And if you want you can join us to set https://github.com/code-charity/youtube/labels, closing issues, etc. \r\n- <b> `managing (old & new) code:`</b> [example](https://github.com/code-charity/youtube/pull/2157)", "hi! @xiomaraR,  thanks and glad if it wasn't too much to read. Let's make this list of types of tasks a [wiki page](https://github.com/code-charity/youtube/wiki) here?\r\nWe don't have a mirror button yet. (closed #80. Once added, we can checkbox it above.)  \r\n - You could start with a [copy of the rotate button](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Acode-charity%2Fyoutube+rotate_button&type=code), adjusting the names & CSS-injection. \r\n   - The function in player.js is the main thing; in our menu Mirror can be listed below Rotate (and you don't have to add it to all the language files, but only to /en/messages.json;  while the first search result (\"core.js\") is only for this: \"// REACTION OR VISUAL FEEDBACK WHEN THE USER CHANGES A SETTING (already automated for our CSS features)\" ) as written above it</i>)\r\n   - So while wanted & minimal, it is ultimately a task AI should do. And for you personally it might only serve to get familiar with webExtensions & this repo (i saw you have a github history\uD83D\uDC4D).  And mirror isn't immediately a unique feature (existing solution with 30 000 users, forgot to link it at first).  So, while i initially though of suggesting Mirror as a beginner-friendly example, it ended up as an example for this type of task instead ( `Assessing / Re-evaluating plans`) <br> and i added this sub-task: (<a href=\"https://github.com/code-charity/youtube/issues/1445#:~:text=remember%20per%20video%20or%20per%20loop%2C%20if%20a%20loop%20is%20set.%20Compare%3A%20mirrortube\"> above </a>)\r\n      - > - [ ] remember per video or per selection, if a loop is or will be set too for this video.

And `moving Subtitles/Captions` below the player will be unique too. (remembered these through checking the labels: #unique, #set&forget, #plan-ready)\r\n         - and we can search more specifically:  [is:open `milestone:\"Little or easy(?)\"` `label:\"\uD83E\uDDE9Plan ready\"` -`label:\"Rare use-case?\"`](https://github.com/code-charity/youtube/issues?q=is%3Aopen+milestone%3A%22Little+or+easy%28%3F%29%22+label%3A%22%F0%9F%A7%A9Plan+ready%22+-label%3A%22Rare+use-case%3F%22+)  \r\n           - so (surprise!) we find the frequent wish of [a shortcut for the rotate button](https://github.com/code-charity/youtube/issues/1699#issuecomment-1751485020)!, part of which you can copy paste in our [shortcuts.js](https://github.com/code-charity/youtube/blob/master/js%26css/web-accessible/www.youtube.com/shortcuts.js?rgh-link-date=2023-10-06T23%3A02%3A12Z).     \r\n         - More over the following player button will be a novelty, since YouTube didn't always provide the headmap:\r\n              - > - [ ] Skip to next key scene data-source: https://github.com/code-charity/youtube/issues/1463 \r\n           -  So this 3rd example, seemed best to suggest,  since this one could (optionally) directly inspire various `Development / engineering`-thoughts. And i and we can join the work /your PRs \r\n              - While working with the JSON will require some more lines of code, but it is typical work. (Q&A/stackoverlow & AI/ chatgpt will help at need);  (and it doesn't help to know this repo yet since we are lacking a data framework. https://github.com/code-charity/youtube/blob/9266d8dfe76eaec30936b4efffcfe931c3c60337/js%26css/web-accessible/www.youtube.com/player.js#L137 ) \r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n" ],

Comment on this issue before starting work so it can be assigned to you. Also, this issue may have been filed with limited detail or changes may have occurred that are worth sharing with you before you start work.\n 2. Drop by our [community chat](https://owncast.rocket.chat/) if you'd like to be involved in more real-time discussion around Owncast to talk about this change.\n 3. Follow the project's getting started tips to make sure you can [build and run the project from source](https://owncast.online/development).\n\n ### Notes\n\n - Development takes place on the `develop` branch.\n - We use Storybook for testing and developing React components. `npm run storybook`. A hosted version [is available for viewing](https://owncast.online/components).\n - If you need to install the Go programming language to run the Owncast backend it's simple from [here](https://go.dev/dl/).\n - Active contributors get an Owncast t-shirt! Ask about it if you feel like you've been contributing and haven't yet been given one.\n\n ### New to Git?\n\n If you're brand new to Git you may want a short primer about the Fork -> Commit -> Pull Request workflow that enables changes to get made collaboratively using git. Visit the [First Contributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) project to learn step-by-step how to commit a change to a Git repository such as this one.", "Found some:\n\n- \"The login username is admin and the password is your stream key, the default being abc123.\"\n[Quickstart Configure](https://owncast.online/quickstart/configure/)\n- \"Configuration is done through the Owncast administration page located on your server under /admin.

It will probably be cheap too since it is an open source model. Here the link - please add a rocket: \nhttps://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingface/InferenceSupport/discussions/2927\n\n",

Then if I understand this correctly, when de-serializing the persisted state, every `ChannelMonitorUpdateStep` for a `ChannelMonitor` is replayed so that we build up to the state we had before the last shutdown. Then, the solution you propose would be to\r\n- Add a new property `allow_automated_broadcast` to `ChannelMonitorImpl` that defaults to `true`\r\n- On `update_monitor`, when matching `ChannelForceClosed` with `should_broadcast: false` set the flag to `false`\r\n- On `broadcast_latest_holder_commitment_txn` check for the flag and if it's `false` then... `log_info!` and do nothing?\r\n\r\nSome questions I have:\r\n- It feels odd to have a method called `braodcast...` that won't _always_ broadcast. Should we either:\r\n  - Rename the method to `maybe_broadcast_latest_holder_commitment_txn`, so that it's explicit that under certain conditions it will not broadcast?\r\n  - Define a new method `maybe_broadcast...` that wraps up the current one but checks the flag first and use this new method in this specific use case?\r\n  \r\n  I'm also asking because the method is also called  when the de-serialized `ChannelManager` is stale compared to the `ChannelMonitor`, though in this case there is a channel in the  founding transactions set ([lines 6789-6804](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/blob/79e2af949700281b7333f202a7292e3bf81dc674/lightning/src/ln/channelmanager.rs#L6789-L6805)). I assume in that case too we want the flag to stop us, but I want to make sure I'm not changing some important semantics.\r\n- Is there any other `ChannelMonitorUpdateStep` that would imply that it's safe again to broadcast? Looking at the docs for the Enum I would guess no, but asking just in case.", "Heh, 1564 didn't resolve this, it just referenced it...", "Yes, your understanding is correct, as for your questions:\r\n\r\n> It feels odd to have a method called braodcast... that won't always broadcast. Should we either:\r\n\r\nProbably the second, its still important that users be able to broadcast the latest state if they want to, so we at least need an option to broadcast the state, though it also wouldn't be unreasonable to split it into two methods - `maybe_` and `force_..._unsafe` to indicate that the first will only work if we think its okay to do so, and the second will force it to happen even if its unsafe to do so.\r\n\r\n> I'm also asking because the method is also called when the de-serialized ChannelManager is stale compared to the ChannelMonitor, though in this case there is a channel in the founding transactions set ([lines 6789-6804](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/blob/79e2af949700281b7333f202a7292e3bf81dc674/lightning/src/ln/channelmanager.rs#L6789-L6805)).

I'll keep working on it but I'm posting my progress here in case anyone wants to throw help/comments/ideas. My idea would be to cover this new behavior with a simple unit test that:\r\n- Builds a `ChannelMonitor`\r\n- Sends it a `ForceClosed{should_broadcast: false}`\r\n- Writes and reads it again\r\n- And then tries to call the new methods and asserts whether the transaction was broadcasted.\r\n\r\nMy plan was to copy and adapt some other other unit test for `broadcast_latest_holder_commitment_txn` but couldn't find any. If I understand correctly, you write unit tests for this at the end of the module and integration tests in separate modules, mostly in `funcional_tests.rs`. I also found:\r\n- A `TestPersister` that I think implement Write And Read in-memory.\r\n- A `TestBroadcaster` that can probably help me with the assertions\r\n- A `check_closed_broadcast!` which I believe won't be useful here cause it's checking whether we broadcasted the channel closed message as a gossip update for network peers. Though I'm not really sure I understood correctly.\r\n- On your last PR Matt, you added `do_test_data_loss_protect` which seems to be a more general case integration test.

      "description" : "### Checklist\n\n- [x] I have checked [FAQs](https://github.com/fla-org/flash-linear-attention/blob/main/FAQs.md) and existing issues for similar problems\n- [x] My GPU is H100 and I have installed `triton-nightly` built by fla team, and double checked [FAQs](https://github.com/fla-org/flash-linear-attention/blob/main/FAQs.md)\n- [x] Please report this bug in English to ensure wider understanding and support\n\n### Describe the Bug\n\n1. A test was designed using the same input sequence, with two inference modes: the first involves a single full forward pass, while the second splits the sequence into multiple segments for sequential forward passes with manual cache transfer. The test checks whether the outputs of the two modes are consistent.\n2. Three models were tested: GSA, GDN, and RWKV7. The results show that GSA and GDN produced inconsistent outputs, whereas RWKV7 passed the test.\n3. In our training mission, all three models showed normal training loss and static validation results. However, the online testing performance of GSA and GDN fell far short of expectations, with results as poor as those of a random policy. By contrast, RWKV7 demonstrated normal online testing results.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce the Bug\n\n```\nimport torch\nimport fla\nfrom fla.models.gated_deltanet.modeling_gated_deltanet import GatedDeltaNetBlock\nfrom fla.models.gated_deltanet.configuration_gated_deltanet import GatedDeltaNetConfig\nfrom fla.models.gsa.modeling_gsa import GSABlock\nfrom fla.models.gsa.configuration_gsa import GSAConfig\nfrom fla.models.utils import Cache\n\nbsz = 1\nhidden_size = 2048\nseq_len = 1024\nseg_len = 128\nlr = 1.0e-3\nuse_cache = True\n\nseg_num = (seq_len - 1) // seg_len + 1\n\nmodel = \"GDN\"\nif model == \"GDN\":\n    config = GatedDeltaNetConfig(\n        attn_mode='chunk',\n        hidden_size=hidden_size,\n        num_heads=8,  \n        head_dim=int(0.75 * hidden_size // 8)\n    )\n    encoder = GatedDeltaNetBlock(\n        config,\n        layer_idx=0\n    ).to('cuda')\nelse:\n    config = GSAConfig(\n        attn_mode='chunk',\n        hidden_size=hidden_size,\n        num_heads=8\n    )\n    encoder = GSABlock(\n        config,\n        layer_idx=0\n    ).to('cuda')\n\ninputs = torch.randn(bsz, seq_len, hidden_size, device='cuda')\n\ny_full, _,  _ = encoder(\n    hidden_states=inputs,\n    past_key_values=None,\n    use_cache=False\n)\n\nb = 0\ncache = None\n\nfor seg_id in range(seg_num):\n    b = seg_id * seg_len\n    e = min(b + seg_len, seq_len)\n\n    segment_input = inputs[:, b:e]\n\n    y_segment, _, cache = encoder(\n        hidden_states=segment_input,\n        past_key_values=cache,\n        use_cache=use_cache,\n    )\n\n    err = torch.sum((y_full[:, b:e] - y_segment)**2)\n    print(f\"Segment {seg_id}: Error = {err.item()}\")\n```\n\nGot the following Output:\nGDN：\nSegment 0: Error = 0.0023405884858220816\nSegment 1: Error = 1012.900634765625\nSegment 2: Error = 1055.44775390625\nSegment 3: Error = 1116.5162353515625\nSegment 4: Error = 1089.9141845703125\nSegment 5: Error = 1107.427734375\nSegment 6: Error = 1104.24560546875\nSegment 7: Error = 1107.385986328125\n\nGSA:\nSegment 0: Error = 1.5609190313625732e-06\nSegment 1: Error = 3535.44677734375\nSegment 2: Error = 3311.689208984375\nSegment 3: Error = 3273.07568359375\nSegment 4: Error = 3326.33642578125\nSegment 5: Error = 3503.629638671875\nSegment 6: Error = 3420.8076171875\nSegment 7: Error = 3332.25048828125\n\nRWKV7:\nSegment 0: Error = 0.0\nSegment 1: Error = 0.0\nSegment 2: Error = 0.0\nSegment 3: Error = 0.0\nSegment 4: Error = 0.0\nSegment 5: Error = 0.0\nSegment 6: Error = 0.0\nSegment 7: Error = 0.0\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nError close to 0.\n\n### Environment Information\n\n1.

This regression might have been introduced in PR [#424](https://github.com/your-repo/your-project/pull/424). A possible (but unconfirmed) cause could be related to the handling of emoji suggestions for the last word — further debugging is required to verify this.\n\n#### Workaround\nExecuting the **plural** command with unknown words seems to restore the Enter key's normal behavior. This behavior is demonstrated in the attached video.\n\n#### Expected Behavior\nPressing the **Enter** key should insert a newline and move the cursor to the next line, maintaining standard input behavior.\n\n#### Attachments\n- Video demonstrating the bug and workaround\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/801cbea9-7138-4833-a1f0-dc6ca471b56b\n\n\n### Device type\n\nSamsung SM-921W\n\n### Versions\n\nandroid 15, Current version of main",

      "description" : "### Is your feature request related to a problem?\n\n- [x] Yes, it is related to a problem\n\n### Describe the feature you'd like\n\n## \uD83C\uDF1F Feature Description\nMigrate the web search functionality from Tavily Search to DuckDuckGo Search.\n\n## \uD83D\uDD0D Problem Statement\nThe current implementation of the web search feature relies on the Tavily Search API. This feature is utilized in the `handle_web_search_node` to perform web searches. The `TavilySearchTool` class in `backend/app/agents/devrel/tools/search_tool.py` directly interacts with the Tavily API. The dependency on Tavily is also specified in the project's dependencies. This migration is intended to replace Tavily Search with DuckDuckGo Search as the primary web search provider.\n\n## \uD83C\uDFAF Expected Outcome\nUpon completion, the project will use DuckDuckGo Search for all web search queries. The `langchain-tavily` and `tavily-python` dependencies will be removed from the project, and a new dependency for a DuckDuckGo search library will be added. The `handle_web_search_node` and the search tool will be updated to use the new DuckDuckGo search functionality.\n\n## \uD83D\uDCF7 Screenshots and Design Ideas\nN/A (This is a backend implementation change with no direct UI impact).\n\n## \uD83D\uDCCB Additional Context\nThe following files will be impacted by this change:\n- `backend/app/agents/devrel/tools/search_tool.py`: The `TavilySearchTool` class will need to be replaced with a new class for DuckDuckGo search.\n- `backend/app/agents/devrel/nodes/handle_web_search_node.py`: The `handle_web_search_node` will need to be updated to use the new DuckDuckGo search tool.\n- `pyproject.toml`: The `langchain-tavily` and `tavily-python` dependencies will be removed and a new dependency for DuckDuckGo search will be added.\n- `backend/app/core/config.py`: The `tavily_api_key` setting will be removed and a new setting for the DuckDuckGo API key may need to be added.\n\n### Record\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\n- [ ] I want to work on implementing this feature",

My DAG configs were: retries=1000, retry_delay=5 min (300 seconds), max_retry_delay=1h (3600 seconds). My DAG failed ~1000 times and after that Scheduler broke down. After that retries exceeded 1000 and stopped on 1017 retry attempt. \n\nI did my research on this problem and found that this happened due to formula **min_backoff = math.ceil(delay.total_seconds() * (2 ** (self.try_number - 1)))** in **taskinstance.py** file. So retry_exponential_backoff has no limit of try_number and during calculations it can overflow max Float value. So even if max_retry_delay is set formula is still calculating.

Since ProbeRunner already stores this reference internally, this integration would be straightforward.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> We should prioritize implementing **initialize** first, as it's the more critical of the two. The finalize callback can be addressed in a follow-up PR.\n\n## Example\n\nHere’s a snippet of code that would be moved into the initialize callback of the `isWeakCrypto` probe:\n\n```js\nthis.tracer = new VariableTracer()\n  .enableDefaultTracing()\n  // ↓↓↓ this part\n  .trace(\"crypto.createHash\", {\n    followConsecutiveAssignment: true, moduleName: \"crypto\"\n  });\n```\n\nWe don't need to trace `crypto.createHash` if the isWeakCrypto probe is not used.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e7dca6f-1881-423b-9fb1-ab8c55736a7a)",

      "url" : "https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy/issues/9094",
      "repositoryName" : "aquasecurity/trivy",
      "description" : "## Description\n\nThis is a feature request to add SHA-512 hash algorithm support to Trivy's SBOM parsing capabilities. Currently, Trivy only supports SHA-1, SHA-256, and MD5 hash algorithms when processing SBOM files.\n\nSome tools, particularly NPM's SBOM generation (`npm sbom`), use SHA-512 hashes for package integrity verification. Adding SHA-512 support would enable Trivy to fully process these SBOMs and preserve important security metadata.\n\n### Current limitations:\n- **CycloneDX**: SHA-512 hashes are ignored and the hashes field becomes `null`\n- **SPDX**: SHA-512 checksums are completely omitted from the output\n\n\n## Current Behavior\n\n### CycloneDX\nIn `pkg/sbom/cyclonedx/unmarshal.go:251-268`, the `unmarshalHashes` function only supports:\n- SHA1\n- SHA256\n- MD5\n\nAny other algorithm (including SHA-512) logs a warning but still creates a digest with an empty algorithm prefix (e.g., `:hashvalue` instead of `sha512:hashvalue`), resulting in malformed digest strings.\n\n### SPDX\nIn `pkg/sbom/spdx/marshal.go:501-522`, the `spdxChecksums` function has the same limitation, returning `nil` for unsupported algorithms.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe limitation stems from `pkg/digest/digest.go` which only defines three algorithms:\n```go\nconst (\n    SHA1   Algorithm = \"sha1\"\n    SHA256 Algorithm = \"sha256\"\n    MD5    Algorithm = \"md5\"\n)\n```\n\n## Desired Behavior\n\nTrivy should support SHA-512 hash algorithm alongside the existing SHA-1, SHA-256, and MD5 support. This would enable Trivy to:\n- Preserve SHA-512 hashes when processing SBOMs from NPM and other tools\n- Generate SBOMs with SHA-512 hashes when appropriate\n- Maintain full compatibility with CycloneDX and SPDX specifications\n\n\n## Impact\n\n- Loss of package integrity verification data\n- Generated SBOMs may be invalid or incomplete\n- Affects tools that rely on SHA-512 for security validation\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n1. Add SHA512 constant to `pkg/digest/digest.go`:\n   ```go\n   const (\n       SHA1   Algorithm = \"sha1\"\n       SHA256 Algorithm = \"sha256\"\n       SHA512 Algorithm = \"sha512\"\n       MD5    Algorithm = \"md5\"\n   )\n   ```\n\n2. Add SHA-512 calculation support in the digest package\n\n3. Update `unmarshalHashes` in CycloneDX:\n   ```go\n   case cdx.HashAlgoSHA512:\n       alg = digest.SHA512\n   ```\n\n4.

It adds to the overhead of getting started with the tool and also complicates simple experiments (I never did the s3 setup, so don't know how it looks like)\n\n> Alternatively, if we really wanted to increase speeds, the payload could be uploaded to a single node first, then they would gossip the payload via a simple predefined route, rest rpc, and even verified via a known hash.\n\nThe problem with this is if we want to go this route, we will need to create a fresh ssh key and authorise it in all nodes to be able to send the data. Alternatively, we could tinker with sending the data using `netcat`, but we won't expect much security from that but maybe that's fine.\n\nCurrently, with `xz` compression, the deployment takes ~4min, I think that's fine, no? ", "> This adds the requirement to always configure s3 buckets\n\nif you set them up on your machine once, then every talis init will grab them. Since this work must be redone for tracing an entire network (every engineer needs to do this imo if we want an actual understanding of what is happening), it seems okay. that's what the original reasoning was at least.\n\n> The problem with this is if we want to go this route, we will need to create a fresh ssh key and authorize it in all nodes to be able to send the data\n\nyeah true but adding ssh keys to operators such as digital ocean and linode is already automated w/ talis. Also doesn't inherently need to be fresh each time.\n\n> Currently, with xz compression, the deployment takes ~4min, I think that's fine, no?\n\nits fine if one has a beefy machine and internet connection and only small talis networks yeah. for example, currently a 16GB laptop cannot run talis for a 20 node network. It's also difficult to run in an office which has ~20MB/s upload per device. For 100+ node networks we likely need a solution or just need to ensure its done efficiently. \n" ],

But I also don't want the alert notification to be obnoxious, so that I can retain my focus.\n\nSome ideas for a better UX:\n- Make the recurring events darker (using the same colors as the events in the past). This will help prevent the problem of the user trying to make an edit in the first case.\n- Replace the regular `alert()` with a toast (use `react-toastify`, which we already use in the `SomedayEventForm`)\n\n### Use Case\n\nThis'll help users still see all their events while also making it less punitive when they naturally attempt to edit a recurring event.\n\n### Additional Context\n\nWe currently only support viewing recurring events in Compass; we do not support making a change to a recurring event (yet). \n\n\nThe current UX:\n\n<img width=\"1914\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9a8d676-f938-4881-bc71-9bfd4f4321f5\" />",

I believe it is okay to stack toast error messages in certain UX scenarios.\n\nI can sort of relate to the annoyance behind stacking repeated identical toasts for this particular UX experience (recurring events) but I don't think we should go and apply it everywhere without careful consideration.\n\nCan you please refactor the code to:\n\n- Provide a parameter like preventDuplicate to the toast function to optionally prevent duplicate messages\n- Have the prevent duplicate toast messages change apply only to recurring events for now. We can discuss preventing duplicate error messages in other places later.\n```", "On it, Thank youuuuu ", "phewww, just created a pr. might wanna check it out.

      "description" : "### Title\n\n[Heading Level] Headings are not properly nested\n\n### Description\n\nTo facilitate navigation and convey the overall document structure, authors must use headings in a properly nested order (for example, an `<h1>` should be followed by `<h2>`, an `<h2>` may be followed by another `<h2>` or `<h3>`, an `<h3>` by another `<h3>` or `<h4>`, and so on). Improper nesting can confuse assistive technology users and impair content discoverability.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. go to a tutorial page (e.g., /tutorials/get-started/).\n2. Locate each heading\n3. Inspect the sequence of heading levels and observe instances where the heading level jumps by more than one (e.g., `<h1>` directly to `<h6>`), indicating improper nesting.\n\nfor example:\n\n#### page 1\n1. Go to /tutorials/setting-up-your-environment/\n2. Locate to the following elements\nPosition 1: h6 element “By Layla Quiñones, Jaleesa Trapp“\n\n#### page 2\n1. Go to /tutorials/get-started/.\n2.  Locate to the following element:\n* Position 1: h4 element \"Default Code\" in Step 1 section\n \n#### page 3\n1. Go to /tutorials/variables-and-change/.\n2.  Locate to the following element:\n* Position 1: h5 element \"Variables\" in Step 1 section\n* Position 2: h5 element \"String Interpolation\" in Step 1 section\n* Position 3: h5 element \"Custom Variables\" in Step 3 section\n* Position 4: h5 element \"Variable Scope\" in Step 3 section\n* Position 5: h5 element \"Using Variables for Animation\" in Step 3 section\n* Position 6: h5 element \"Animation and draw()\" in Step 4 section\n* Position 70: h5 element \"frameRate(), frameCount and console.log()\" in Step 4 section\n* Position 81: h5 element \"Error Messages\" in Step 7 section\n\n#### page 4\n1. Go to /tutorials/organizing-code-with-functions/.\n2.  Locate to the following element:\n* Position 1: h6 element \"By Greg Benedis-Grab, Layla Quiñones\"\n* Position 2: h5 element \"Or Try This Spicy Challenge!\" in Conclusion section\n* Position 3: h1 element \"Next Steps\"\n* Position 4: h1 element \"References\"\n\n#### page 5\n1. Go to /data-structure-garden/.\n2.  Locate to the following element:\n* Position 1: h6 element \"By Portia Morrell, Jaleesa Trapp, Kate Maschmeyer\"\n\n#### page 6\n1. Go to /tutorials/animating-with-media-objects/.\n2.  Locate to the following element:\n* Position 1: h6 element \"By Joanne Amarisa, Jaleesa Trapp, Greg Benedis-Grab\"\n* Position 2: h4 element \"Image files\" in step 1 section\n* Position 3: h3 element \"Conclusion\"\n* Position 4: h3 element \"Resources & References\"\n\n#### Page 7\nGo to route (p5js.org)\n2. Try to find h1 element in the page\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThose headings are not nested according to the heading-level hierarchy. For details, see the ‘Steps to Reproduce’ section above.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nAll headings should follow a logical, nested structure.\n\n### Environments\n\n_No response_\n\n### Suggested Fix\n\n_No response_\n\n### Reference\n\nWCAG: [Success Criterion 1.3.1 Info and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#info-and-relationships)\nWCAG-T: [G141: Organizing a page using headings](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/general/G141)\nother:[Headings and paragraphs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Headings_and_paragraphs)\n\n### What is your operating system?\n\nNone\n\n### Web browser and version\n\n_No response_",

It seems the goal of this optimization is to simplify the comparisons involving ANY or SOME operators when the left hand is constant and the right side contains a constant that can evaluate the operation to be True.\n\nTo achieve this, I was considering adding a function called FoldAnyWithConst in [fold_constants.opt](https://github.com/ahuangg/cockroach/blob/master/pkg/sql/opt/norm/rules/fold_constants.opt) \n```\n# FoldAnyWithConst simplifies a scalar ANY operation when the left side is constant\n# and the right side contains a constant that can determine the result, like this:\n# 0.1 < ANY (c0, 0.4) can be simplified since 0.1 < 0.4 is True\n[FoldAnyWithConst, Normalize]\n(AnyScalar\n    $left:* & (IsConstValueOrGroupOfConstValues $left)\n    $right:* &\n    (Let\n        ($result $ok):(FoldAnyWithConst (OpName) $left $right) $ok\n    )\n)\n=>\n$result\n```\nthen doing the actual implementation of the function in [fold_constants_funcs.go](https://github.com/ahuangg/cockroach/blob/master/pkg/sql/opt/norm/fold_constants_funcs.go) in a similar fashion to how the other functions are implemented in the file. \n\nPlease let me know what you think, feedback is appreciated.\n", "That sounds like the correct approach to me.\n\nOne thing we'll have to be mindful about is `NULL` values. We should be find as long as we only fold to `true`, and never `false`.\n\n```sql\nSELECT 1 < ANY (2, NULL), 1 < ANY(0, NULL);\n--   ?column? | ?column?\n-- -----------+-----------\n--      t     |   NULL\n-- (1 row)\n```", "Seeing as this issue has been inactive for a month - can this be assigned to me?\n\n@DrewKimball @mgartner ", "Hi @DrewKimball and @rytaft,\n\nI'd like to work on this issue.

My plugin is loaded (I see my logs), but the [extendMarkdownPageData](vscode-file://vscode-app/usr/share/code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html) function is never called during the build, even though I have many markdown files in my [docs](vscode-file://vscode-app/usr/share/code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html) folder.\n\nHere’s a minimal version of my plugin:\n\n```\n// src/plugins/git-commit-info/index.js\nconst { exec } = require('child_process');\n\nfunction getLastCommitHashAsync(filePath) {\n  return new Promise((resolve) => {\n    exec(`git log -n 1 --pretty=format:%h -- \\\"${filePath}\\\"`, { encoding: 'utf8' }, (err, stdout) => {\n      if (err) return resolve(null);\n      resolve(stdout.trim());\n    });\n  });\n}\n\nconsole.log('[git-commit-info] Plugin loaded');\n\nmodule.exports = function (context, options) {\n  return {\n    name: 'docusaurus-plugin-git-commit-info',\n    async extendMarkdownPageData(mdData) {\n      console.log('[git-commit-info] mdData:', mdData);\n      // ...rest of logic...\n      return mdData;\n    },\n  };\n};\n```\n\nAnd in my docusaurus.config.js I add it like this:\n\n```\nplugins: [\n  require.resolve('./src/plugins/git-commit-info'),\n  // other plugins...\n],\n```\n\nBut the hook is never triggered.\n\nWhat I have tried so far:\n\nI confirmed that my plugin is being loaded by adding [console.log('[git-commit-info] Plugin loaded');] at the top level, and I see this message during the build.\nI added multiple [console.log]  statements inside the [extendMarkdownPageData] function to check if it is ever called and to inspect the [mdData] object.\nI verified that I have many markdown files in my [docs] directory, and they are referenced in my sidebar.\nI tried running the build with different Docusaurus versions.\nI also considered moving the plugin to remarkPlugins, but I understand this is not the correct approach for Docusaurus content plugins.\nDespite these steps, the extendMarkdownPageData function is never called during the build.\n\nMy questions:\nIs [extendMarkdownPageData](vscode-file://vscode-app/usr/share/code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html) only called for plugins loaded as part of the docs content pipeline (e.g., via docs.plugins in [docusaurus.config.js](vscode-file://vscode-app/usr/share/code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html)), and not for plugins in the main plugins array?\nShould I add my plugin to the docs.plugins array instead?\nIs there a recommended way to hook into the docs processing pipeline to add metadata to each doc page?\nIs there anything else I might be missing?\nThank you for your help!\n", "Thank you!

I don't have a \"plan\" in the standard sense. I am working on software that provides a GUI for \"plan builder\" for running my experiment. \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/498da074-9fd5-45e4-90ca-0caf5061c4b0)\n\nIn general, it can be summarized to the plan like this:\n\n```\ndevices = [motor0, motor1, motor2, detector0,....]\nmonitor = [motor0, motor1, motor2,...]\nunmonitor_before_read = [motor2,motor1]\ndef plan():\n    yield from bps.open_run()\n    yield from bps.trigger_and_read(devices)\n    for motor in monitor:\n        yield from bps.monitor(motor, name=motor.name+\"_monitor\")\n\n    # >>> generated by \"plan builder\"\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            for m in unmonitor_before_read:\n                yield from bps.unmonitor(m)\n            yield from bps.trigger_and_read(devices)\n            for m in unmonitor_before_read:\n                yield from bps.monitor(m,name=m.name+\"_monitor\")\n    # << generated by \"plan builder\"\n    \n    yield from bps.close_run()\n```\nSo I start and interrupt the monitors depending on the inner plans. As I said before, the error appears randomly, so I can't reproduce it in the simplified plan. I do not exclude that \"plan builder\" generates code with errors, as this project is in its early stage.\nA simple copy of the `_listeners` dict solves the problem, so I decided to share it with the community...\n" ],

Schema Refactor (Supabase)\n- Identify all instances of `owner_id` across the Supabase schema (tables, relationships, foreign keys).\n- Rename the columns to `kinder_id`, preserving existing constraints.\n- Create a properly versioned SQL migration file using Supabase CLI and place it under `services/supabase/migrations/`.\n- Validate database consistency after the rename through Supabase CLI and dashboard tools.\n\n### 2. Backend Adjustments (`services/supabase`)\n- Refactor all code references to `owner_id` across query logic, types, and service utilities.\n- Ensure all affected endpoints and mutations behave as expected with the updated schema.\n\n### 3. Frontend Integration (`apps/web`)\n- Update Supabase queries, types, and hooks that reference `owner_id`.\n- Refactor relevant components or forms handling project ownership or user metadata.\n- Run and update any impacted unit tests or mocks accordingly.\n\n### 4. Documentation\n- Update schema diagrams, ERD references, and technical documentation under `docs/` to reflect the updated field naming and align with project terminology.\n\n###  Deliverables\n- Fully working PR with schema + code changes.\n- A Supabase CLI-compatible SQL migration script.\n- Clear changelog and commit breakdown.\n- Optional: Schema diff or notes for internal dev reference.\n\n**ETA:** I estimate 36–48 hours for full implementation, testing, and documentation updates.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to take it! \nHappy to help standardize and improve the DB structure.\n", "# Hi there, @4c1d-V \uD83D\uDC4B You've been assigned this issue.\n\nOne invite is waiting for you in your email.

      "description" : "**Describe the problem**\n\nEdit 4/11/2025:\n\nThis issue should be scoped to just updating how we're defining the default value of the aria-label on Spinner. Ideally we want the default value to be rendered in the props table, rather than rendering as though there isn't any default value currently.\n\n\nOriginal comment:\n\nThe `Spinner` component hardcodes `aria-label` attribute when neither `aria-label` nor `aria-labelledby` is provided.\n\nhttps://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/blob/3ba79b0c6c6e750996f6134251dc6c6bd5eeb28a/packages/react-core/src/components/Spinner/Spinner.tsx#L47\n\n**How do you reproduce the problem?**\n\nMount a `Spinner` without providing an `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`.\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nA spinner without a hardcoded English value. The component should allow consumers to use it without `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`. It might be just a complementary visual hint hidden from the a11y tree using `aria-hidden` when rendered alongside relevant text.\n\n**Is this issue blocking you?**\n\nSomehow. A workaround exists by setting `aria-labelledby`, but it would be preferable if, as said above, the spinner could be used as a visual hint for sighted users while being excluded from the a11y tree.\n\n**Screenshots**\n\nN/A\n\n**What is your environment?**\n\nN/A\n\n**What is your product and what release date are you targeting?**\n\nN/A\n\n**Any other information?**\n\n- The [Spinner props documentation](https://www.patternfly.org/components/spinner#spinner) does not mention a default value for `aria-label`.\n- This behavior was introduced in commit 09733cb4f0fc5cd67f5df284 as part of https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/pull/6730, but I was not able to find the reasoning there.\n- `aria-valuetext` also has a hardcoded default value, even when it may not be applicable.\n\n  > `aria-valuetext` is only needed when the numeric value of `aria-valuenow` is not meaningful.  \n  >\n  > [MDN Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-valuetext)\n",

Main reason being is that the spinner will convey that the loading progress is \"indeterminate\", which surrounding text may or may not do. Semantically having the Spinner exposed may make more sense as well than just plain text.\n\nAt least according to MDN, either aria-label or aria-labelledby is also required on the progressbar role. That I think makes sense since just the aria-valuenow content (be it \"Loading\" or something similar) doesn't provide great context (what exactly is loading?).\n\nThough I might strongly recommend against it, if `aria-hidden` is being passed to a Spinner, that should somewhat resolve the issue of having a default aria-label applied.

Semantically having the Spinner exposed may make more sense as well than just plain text.\n> \n> At least according to MDN, either aria-label or aria-labelledby is also required on the progressbar role. \n\nArg! My fault! I completely overlooked the `progressbar` role that the Spinner SVG is using! That’s why I wasn’t fully understanding the decision of going for these default values.\n\nRegarding having both the `aria-label` and the static text, I thought it might be redundant and possibly annoying for screen reader users, especially if both contain the same message. In any case, now that I have a better understanding, I’ll rework my use of the Spinner to include only one descriptive text. Either by using `aria-labelledby` or by adding `aria-hidden` to the static text if it doesn’t provide any additional value.\n\n> That I think makes sense since just the aria-valuenow content (be it \"Loading\" or something similar) doesn't provide great context (what exactly is loading?).\n\nFully agree. \"Loading\" alone lacks the necessary context.\n\n> \n> Though I might strongly recommend against it, if `aria-hidden` is being passed to a Spinner, that should somewhat resolve the issue of having a default aria-label applied. While the aria-label will still be there, the Spinner won't be in the a11y tree.\n> \n\nNo doubts, I’ve got a long road ahead on my accessibility learning journey, as this issue has proven. That said, in my tests, when `aria-hidden` is applied, the entire Spinner is removed from the accessibility tree, including its `aria-label` (checked with Chrome and Firefox developer tools) .\n\n> I do think we can tweak the Spinner code so that the default value of aria-label is rendered in the props table, though.\n\nAgain, thank you for your enlightening explanation and please excuse me for reporting this as an issue when it clearly wasn’t one \uD83D\uDE4F ", "It's better to raise an issue that may turn out to be intended behavior than have something sneak by us, so absolutely no worries opening this! We don't know what we don't know and all, and whether it leads to us fixing/adding something to improve the user experience or just a good discussion, it's worth it.\n\nI'll edit your original comment just to note what this issue should go towards resolving (updating how we're defining the default value). If you'd be interested in working on it just let me know and I can assign you (no pressure to, though), otherwise I can put a \"good first issue\" label for others to pick it up.", "> If you'd be interested in working on it just let me know and I can assign you (no pressure to, though), otherwise I can put a \"good first issue\" label for others to pick it up.\n\nI fear I'm a bit busy these days \uD83D\uDE22 for investing the time it needs to be not only changed but also properly tested. So, I'd label it as good first issue and give others a chance to work on it.\n\nThat said, just in case could be useful for others, as far as I could check, https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-org is relying on https://github.com/reactjs/react-docgen for generating the [PropsTable](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-org/blob/main/packages/documentation-framework/components/propsTable/propsTable.js#L18). Thus, I guess it could be as simple as moving the default value to the props initialization as shown in below diff\n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/packages/react-core/src/components/Spinner/Spinner.tsx b/packages/react-core/src/components/Spinner/Spinner.tsx\nindex 77e599773..4099da094 100644\n--- a/packages/react-core/src/components/Spinner/Spinner.tsx\n+++ b/packages/react-core/src/components/Spinner/Spinner.tsx\n@@ -32,7 +32,7 @@ export const Spinner: React.FunctionComponent<SpinnerProps> = ({\n   'aria-valuetext': ariaValueText = 'Loading...',\n   diameter,\n   isInline = false,\n-  'aria-label': ariaLabel,\n+  'aria-label': ariaLabel = 'Contents',\n   'aria-labelledBy': ariaLabelledBy,\n   ...props\n }: SpinnerProps) => (\n@@ -42,9 +42,7 @@ export const Spinner: React.FunctionComponent<SpinnerProps> = ({\n     aria-valuetext={ariaValueText}\n     viewBox=\"0 0 100 100\"\n     {...(diameter && { style: { [cssDiameter.name]: diameter } as React.CSSProperties })}\n-    {...(ariaLabel && { 'aria-label': ariaLabel })}\n-    {...(ariaLabelledBy && { 'aria-labelledBy': ariaLabelledBy })}\n-    {...(!ariaLabel && !ariaLabelledBy && { 'aria-label': 'Contents' })}\n+    {...(ariaLabelledBy ? { 'aria-labelledBy': ariaLabelledBy } : { 'aria-label': ariaLabel })}\n     {...props}\n   >\n     <circle className={styles.spinnerPath} cx=\"50\" cy=\"50\" r=\"45\" fill=\"none\" />\n```\n\nHowever, this approach puts the component at risk of having neither `aria-label` nor `aria-labelledby` if the consumer passes an empty string for the former and omits the latter.

      "description" : "**Describe the bug**\r\nTalk back is not reading Arabic language in Audio Language dialog box \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Go to 'Place Values'\r\n2. Double tap on 'What are place values'\r\n3. Double tap on 'Audio' button\r\n4. Double tap on 'Change language' icon\r\n5. Audio Language dialog box appears\r\n6. Swipe across the various languages\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nTalk back to read all the language names including Arabic\r\n\r\n\r\n**Environment**\r\nDevice name: One plus Nord2 5G\r\nAndroid version : Android 11\r\nApp version : 0.7-alpha-d1b2827517\r\n\r\n**Explanation and suggested solution**\r\nIn `LanguageDialogFragment`, we use ` appLanguageResourceHandler.computeLocalizedDisplayName(audioLanguage)` to get the display name for ecah language. The Arabic language therefore is displayed in Arabic characters, which talkback, when localized to English, cannot read. \r\n\r\nTalkback relies on content descriptions where available, but since this list is dynamic, we can use an accessibility delegate to instruct talkback on how to read Arabic(and Hindi too).\r\n\r\nWhen creating the dialog, override the accessibility properties of the list items by accessing the AlertDialog's ListView after creation:\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\nval options = languageNameArrayList.toTypedArray<CharSequence>()\r\nval languageInterface: LanguageInterface = parentFragment as AudioFragment\r\n\r\nval alertDialog = AlertDialog.Builder(ContextThemeWrapper(activity as Context, R.style.OppiaDialogFragmentTheme))\r\n  ...\r\n    .create()\r\n\r\nalertDialog.setOnShowListener {\r\n    val listView = alertDialog.listView\r\n    for (i in 0 until listView.childCount) {\r\n        val item = listView.getChildAt(i)\r\n        item?.setAccessibilityDelegate(object : View.AccessibilityDelegate() {\r\n            override fun onInitializeAccessibilityNodeInfo(\r\n                host: View?,\r\n                info: AccessibilityNodeInfo?\r\n            ) {\r\n                super.onInitializeAccessibilityNodeInfo(host, info)\r\n                // Get the item text\r\n           \r\n                // Set content description for TalkBack\r\n                        }\r\n        })\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nreturn alertDialog\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nUI tests are expected for the submitted code.\r\n",

For devices where this setting is not set to Arabic, this results in any Arabic words being skipped.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-07-12 at 12 38 19 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17b33f5d-1e10-4ab2-b33b-042bbd90f4c9)\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the current behavior means that the other languages in the list _aren't_ being read in their native TTS languages, which can be confusing to understand (eg. the Chinese characters for Mandarin Chinese are read in a hard-to-understand English TTS 'accent'). \r\n\r\n**Proposed Approach**\r\nUpdate `AppLanguageResourceHandler::computeLocalizedDisplayName` so that it returns a `SpannableString` instead of a `String` and wrap the returned string with `LocaleString.` By doing so, we can specify a locale that allows TalkBack to dyanmically switch to the proper TTS voice based on the language. This change would also require updating the `OptionsAudioLanguageViewModel` and `AudioLanguageSelectionViewModel` display language property to use `SpannableString` instead of `String.` \r\n\r\nLet me know if these are the methods/files that should be updated in this fix, thanks!\r\n\r\n", "Hi @elin4046, thanks for researching this. I have a few follow ups:\r\n- Typically, we don't use Locale directly in the codebase. However, if you can create a function in  the `OppiaLocale` class, it might work.\r\n- Configuring locale specific tts voice is technically out of scope for this issue. However, if it is an automatic side effect of the fix, then we can test it out and get product feedback on it. \r\n\r\n\r\nDo you mind  trying this fix and doing a screen recording so we can see what it is like?\r\n\r\n**Additional Context**\r\nThe Oppia app is set up to use the device language by default, and if the device is configure in mandarin for example, most tts will be in mandarin. However, for app strings, mandarin is not one of the translated languages we currently support, and talkback relies on content descriptions to describe the app, so for untranslated strings will default to English.", "@theayushyadav11, here's another issue to look at.

Then, I [reference](https://github.com/rmartin16/briefcase-test/blob/467fafe36679c579c0400f20603654295785e2a1/docs/index.rst?plain=1#L18) the `common-1.rst` file from the Briefcase's `index.rst`.\r\n\r\nproject repo: https://github.com/rmartin16/briefcase-test\r\ncommon doc repo: https://github.com/rmartin16/beeware-common-docs-test\r\n\r\nThis all works rather seamlessly, IMO. There will need to be a workflow to bump the submodule commit in the project repos when the common doc repo is updated, though.\r\n\r\n[edit] I guess a major issue this is likely to create is unaware contributors trying to build docs without the submodule....since `git` apparently doesn't clone submodules by default. So, anyone trying to build docs will need to run `git submodule update --init` or have run `git clone --recurse-submodules` initially...", "> What if we leverage git submodules?\r\n\r\nThat's definitely one way to avoid reproducing content; I'm not sure how I feel about it, though. I've historically avoided submodules unless I absolutely have to use them - I've found them to be one of those features that superficially works, but ends up making your life a whole lot more complicated in the long run (especially for contributors that haven't got experience with submodules - which is most of them).\r\n\r\nAt the risk of re-inventing the wheel - I wonder if it might be more reliable to use the same general approach, but build the subrepo cloning part as a build pre-processing step using regular git cloning.", "> I've found them to be one of those features that superficially works, but ends up making your life a whole lot more complicated in the long run (especially for contributors that haven't got experience with submodules - which is most of them).\r\n\r\nThis is fair and definitely one of my concerns for a submodule.\r\n\r\n> At the risk of re-inventing the wheel - I wonder if it might be more reliable to use the same general approach, but build the subrepo cloning part as a build pre-processing step using regular git cloning.\r\n\r\nhmm...this definitely ventures in to wheel reinvention territory.\r\n\r\nWhile this approach avoids the submodule, it introduces ambiguities that the submodule makes explicit. Notably, the current version of the \"common docs\" incorporated in to any single project's published docs is implicit. Now, we can create workflows around ensuring any updates committed to the \"common docs\" are more or less immediately pushed to dependent repos....but that doesn't remove the inherent implicit nature of which version of the \"common docs\" is being used.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if we're willing to automate the management of pulling and building docs from a remote repo, then it seems much more trivial to simply have `tox` ensure the submodule is initialized and updated prior to building the docs....rather than trying to manually clone a repo and add it to the project's docs.\r\n\r\nBut, even then, the \"common docs\" commit used for the submodule in a project repo still needs to be maintained. So, either way, we need a process to ensure updates in the \"common docs\" are disseminated to relevant repos and their docs are republished.\r\n\r\nGiven the submodule is only necessary to build the docs...and the only real way to build the docs is to run `tox`, I think much of the concern of contributors getting caught up in having to understand submodules can be avoided. That said, I don't have strong feelings and don't have much experience managing a submodule over time.", "> > At the risk of re-inventing the wheel - I wonder if it might be more reliable to use the same general approach, but build the subrepo cloning part as a build pre-processing step using regular git cloning.\r\n> \r\n> hmm...this definitely ventures in to wheel reinvention territory.\r\n> \r\n> While this approach avoids the submodule, it introduces ambiguities that the submodule makes explicit.\r\n\r\nThat would depend a bit on the implementation - we could make our implementation use specific git hash or similar. However, at the very least, a non-trivial re-implementation of a not-insignificant portion of git submodules would be required.\r\n\r\n> Given the submodule is only necessary to build the docs...and the only real way to build the docs is to run `tox`, I think much of the concern of contributors getting caught up in having to understand submodules can be avoided. \r\n\r\nThat's a fair point. My experience is that the core git submodule implementation \"works\" - it's just near-impossible for a normal human to consistently drive correctly. These problems stem from the fact that submodules aren't deeply integrated into the \"default\" git workflow, so you end up with stale checkouts, or incompatible checkouts, or something else like that. \r\n\r\nIf we can make the existence of the submodules completely transparent to the end user - so running `tox e docs/docs-lint/docs-live` *completely* manages submodule cloning, updating, etc; and the existence of the submodule doesn't impact on any other development behavior (e.g., causing issues switching between branches), then this might be an approach worth pursuing.\r\n", "A sync between the Toga and Briefcase contribution guides is in progress. \n\nThere is a somewhat significant amount of duplicated content between the two code contribution guides, and the documentation guides are 99.9% the same. I feel the idea of consolidating content is a discussion worth continuing.\n\nI put some time into looking into whether there were any options, inherent to Sphinx, available for consolidating content. As far as I can tell, Sphinx does not support any features that would do this natively. Directly cloning the repo would avoid submodules, but the issue of being able to edit the common docs in the wrong location seems as possible with this method as with submodules. Other than this issue, the rest could be made relatively transparent to the user.\n\nAnother issue that came up is searchability. Users have reported that it's difficult to find info with the docs being spread across multiple repos. Something that is worth looking into for this are [Read the Docs subprojects](https://docs.readthedocs.com/platform/stable/subprojects.html). This would require having a \"primary\" documentation repo, perhaps on `beeware/beeware`, that the rest of the tools are added to as subprojects. Then, the docs would be searchable across all projects - the project-wide search is available from the \"primary\" project, as well as any of the subprojects. The search has a checkbox for \"Include subprojects\" and that is how you choose to search all the projects at once - there is an [active issue](https://github.com/readthedocs/addons/issues/22) open to add the ability to configure it to be checked by default. This change may effect some of the plan [here](https://github.com/beeware/beeware/discussions/522#discussioncomment-13502604), so it's something we would need to discuss.

Users have reported that it's difficult to find info with the docs being spread across multiple repos.\n\nOnce the docs are all moved to beeware.org subdomains, it'll become possible to do this with an external search engine that supports filtering by domain, e.g. Google has `site:beeware.org`." ],

      "description" : "### Problem: What is happening?\n\nDevopness provides a tutorial that guides users through key workflows, such as adding projects, environments, servers, applications, and more. The tutorial is available in the [Devopness Guide][1]. To support users during these workflows, help documentation is displayed via the `?` buttons on various pages.\n\nHowever, several challenges have been identified:\n1. **Missing Documentation**: Some pages accessed during the tutorial do not have associated help documentation, leaving users without guidance when they need it most.\n2. **Incorrect Documentation Paths**: Certain help articles exist but are not properly linked, making them inaccessible via the `?` button.\n3. **Outdated Instructions**: Some help documentation reflects older UI/UX flows that have since been updated, causing confusion for users who rely on these instructions.\n\nThis issue aims to address these challenges by ensuring all tutorial steps and key pages have complete, accurate, and actionable help documentation. By doing so, we can enhance the onboarding experience, provide clarity, and ensure users can complete workflows efficiently.\n\n---\n\n### **Task List**\n\n#### Missing Documentation\n- [x] #1203\n- [x] #1206\n- [ ] #1207\n- [ ] #1208\n- [x] #1209\n- [x] #1210\n- [ ] #1211\n- [ ] #1212\n- [ ] #1213\n- [ ] #1214\n- [x] #1215\n- [x] #1216\n- [x] #1217\n- [x] #1204\n- [ ] #1205\n\n\n---\n\n#### Path Fixes\n- [ ] #1218\n- [ ] #1219\n\n---\n\n#### Improvements to Existing Documentation\n- [x] #1220\n- [x] #1221\n- [x] #1223\n\n[1]: https://devopness.com/docs\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nAll tutorial steps and key pages should have complete, accurate, and actionable help documentation accessible via the `?` buttons. Users should be able to follow workflows without confusion or interruption.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Go to the [Devopness tutorial](https://devopness.com/docs).\n2. Navigate through the tutorial steps (e.g., projects, environments, servers).\n3. Click on the ? button for help documentation on pages listed in the issue (e.g., projects/list-projects, teams/list-teams).\n4. Observe whether the expected help documentation is available or accessible.\n\n### Which Devopness module(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nDocumentation\n\n### Package Version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Reproduction link\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional details\n\n_No response_",

We’ve noticed that other users have reported similar issues, as seen in the forum thread you are mentioning. However, we kindly ask that such discussions be continued there in order to keep issues at one place and as this tracker is intended for framework-related issues. Once solution is found and its only a matter of integration, a PR https://github.com/armbian/build/pulls should be opened - by anyone.\n\nThis particular bug appears to be tied to the specific hardware/kernel combination and not related to Armbian OS or assembly itself. It's worth noting that this issue does not manifest on Raspberry Pi or x86 platforms, which benefit from significantly larger development resources — for instance, Raspberry Pi OS has a dedicated full-time staff and a yearly budget exceeding 1 million USD. In contrast, Armbian relies heavily on community support and volunteer contributions with budget ([taken from here](https://github.com/sponsors/armbian)). And we compile 80 different kernels for docents of platforms. Most of them are not even close to level of Raspberry Pi. And even there, users finds issues https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/issues\n\nAs frustrating as it may be, the reality in open source is that some issues—especially those requiring deep investigation—can take years to resolve. We fully understand the inconvenience and appreciate your patience and contributions." ],

      "description" : "# Bug\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  I'm trying to play a video in a real iOS device that is too heavy (2 min length) and it size is 429.7 MB. In Android i was able to change the bufferConfig prop and i tested in a real Android device and it works, but in iOS, i changed the prop `preferredForwardBufferDuration` but the video still stop playing after some seconds because the loaded buffer isn't enough to continue playing the video. Moreover, i tested setting `automaticallyWaitsToMinimizeStalling` to false but it doesn't work. \r\nWhat i understood is that if i put `preferredForwardBufferDuration=15` it means that the player will load 15 video seconds into the memory before continue playing the video but it doesn't work like that. It seems that preferredForwardBufferDuration is always in 0\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Platform\r\n<!--\r\niOS AVplayer\r\n-->\r\nWhich player are you experiencing the problem on:\r\n* iOS real device (iPhone 11).\r\n\r\n## Environment info\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Run `react-native info` in your terminal and copy the results here.

Like how anyone can make a Docker image without publishing it to the Docker Hub.\n\nAnother metric could be the interaction with the [`appimage.github.io` repo](https://github.com/AppImage/appimage.github.io/), where users can submit PRs to include AppImages in the list.", "Google trends:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa9182f0-3ecf-4a56-adc4-618a25fe6dab)\n\nWill this do?", "Yep, that certainly looks good enough to me, @prem-k-r \uD83D\uDC4D\uD83C\uDFFB " ],

However, when editing the name of the task, sometimes the app lets you keep the line break on it.\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d4a8beb-35d4-4f34-8042-5e5e31deeaaa\n\nThis example was a simplification of the issue, but some apps / sites add a invisible line break after the copied text, so this issue might appear more often.\n\n(TBH it doesn't seem like this is a deal breaker, but I can imagine this having some potential issues if any other area of the app is not expecting line breaks at all on this field, so I am creating this issue just in case).\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Open any Note-taking app to test this out\n2. Write any sentence in two lines, with an Enter line-break. Example:\n\n```\nthis is \na test\n```\n\n3. Copy this text\n4. Add a new task in Super Productivity\n5. Paste the text on the name field of the task, and save (pressing Enter or clicking away from the task field)\nYou will notice that the line breaks got stripped down and the text is in a single line\n7. Select the name field of the task again, and paste the text again on it.\nYou _should_ notice that the text is now in multiple lines.\n\n### Can you reproduce this reliably?\n\nYes, I can reproduce it reliably.\n\n### Console Output\n\n```shell\n\n```",

This causes delays, unnecessary follow-ups, and risks around incorrect or incomplete releases.\nWe believe we already know the core information needed to initiate a release (e.g., release identifier, target component, identity version). By formalizing how this is collected, we can empower engineers to submit higher-quality requests and reduce the coordination burden on the release manager.\nWhat we aim to do in this task:\nDefine the minimum required fields engineers must provide when requesting a release (e.g., release identifier, target component, identity version). Create a lightweight, accessible format for collecting this information, for example a Slack form. Align with the release manager to ensure this structure covers all needed details.\n\n## Goal\n\nA clearly documented and easy-to-use mechanism for engineers to request a release, integrated into our current channel #top-monorepo-release.\n",

I will write a brief TypeScript test to confirm that math.unit(5) compiles and yields a dimensionless Unit, and update the docs to illustrate this use. I’ve spent years refining TypeScript declaration files for React and Express libraries, navigating monorepos and CI pipelines, and I’m confident I can deliver a clean, well-tested solution that improves the developer experience for everyone using math.js." ],

", "@pepicrft  \nThank you for the response.\n\nI've reviewed your advice alongside the codebase, and I'm currently organizing what needs to be done before diving into the implementation.  \n\nIt might take me a couple of days, as I need to wrap my head around how the SPM plugin system itself works, and a few other things.\n\nBefore I start coding in earnest, would you mind reviewing my current understanding and planned approach? I'd really appreciate your feedback.", "@pepicrft \nLet me check some word definitions in this [message](https://github.com/tuist/tuist/issues/6096#issuecomment-2995627336).\n## Q1\n\n> The official one where Xcode takes care of everything \n\nIs this referring to the process to `add .package(url:) to Project's property of packages in Project.swift` as following ?\n```swift\nlet project = Project(\n    name: \"Framework\",\n    packages: [\n        .package(url: \"https://github.com/ordo-one/package-benchmark\", .upToNextMajor(from: \"1.4.0\")),\n    ],\n  // ...\n```\nFor this case, after `tuist install` `tuist generate`:  plugin is treated as a native package dependency. \n\n<image src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68e39d6e-8149-40ca-9e93-bf7d12b86adb\" width=350>\n\n\n\n\n## Q2 \n\n> the one where Tuist converts everything into Xcode targets.\n\nDoes this mean we must convert SPM plugin dependency `defined in Package.swift` into Xcode Projects, create targets, and  set up dependencies between those targets ?", "> Is this referring to the process to add .package(url:) to Project's property of packages in Project.swift as following ?\n\nRight, that use case is already supported.\n\n> Does this mean we must convert SPM plugin dependency defined in Package.swift into Xcode Projects, create targets, and set up dependencies between those targets ?\n\nThat's exactly right. An important piece is the [PackageInfoMapper](https://github.com/tuist/tuist/blob/main/cli/Sources/TuistLoader/SwiftPackageManager/PackageInfoMapper.swift) that does the majority of the mapping from SwiftPM definition to the Tuist definition. This mapping currently does not support SwiftPM plugins. If you search for `macro` in that file, you'll see the important bits for converting a macro into the Tuist definition.", "Hi!\n\nI’m doing some experiments and would like to clarify one point.\n\nI selected [SwiftLintPlugin](https://github.com/lukepistrol/SwiftLintPlugin/blob/main/Package.swift#L26) as a sample and noticed that the plugin depends on `SwiftLintBinary.artifactbundle.zip` instead of an xcframework.\n\nDoes this mean we would need to introduce a new architecture to handle this pattern properly? Or is there an existing approach that I might have overlooked?", "> Does this mean we would need to introduce a new architecture to handle this pattern properly? Or is there an existing approach that I might have overlooked?\n\nYou will need to unzip the bundle when generating the project – and then grab the `.xcframework` that should be inside the archive. It might be good to start with that in a separate PR _or_ choose a different plugin that doesn't depend on a zipped binary target." ],

The [W3C specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context-2/#trace-flags) for the flags only contains two flags, and it's my understanding that the `sampled` flag isn't particularly meaningful at the point where we're processing data in the Collector (it must necessarily be `1` since we have the trace).\r\n\r\nFrom what I can tell, we should offer a read-only `flags.random_trace_id` field or similar that provides a boolean representation of the `random-trace-id` flag.", "Reading more of the [field definition](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/blob/main/opentelemetry/proto/trace/v1/trace.proto#L114), it looks like there are a few more flags that can be stored in the field, but I still think we should consider offering paths for each flag. We could potentially offer something like `flags.raw_value` or similar for direct access to the bit sequence.", "@evan-bradley to start can we implement it like we implemented [flags for logs](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/421d710d3d8ceb28e375f57109ae976423713f9d/pkg/ottl/contexts/ottllog/log.go#L468-L480)", "Didn't realize logs had a flags field as well, thanks for pointing that out. Are you ware of any usages of that field? I think the UX is likely not very good:\r\n\r\n1. Reading out the flags as an integer doesn't seem immediately useful to me, I'm not clear what a user would be able to do with the raw value. Also since there are only a limited set of flags, it would probably make sense to have OTTL pull them out individually since we don't have the bitwise operations necessary to allow users to read them in a statement.\r\n2. Right now [the logs proto field](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/blob/main/opentelemetry/proto/logs/v1/logs.proto#L185) says it only contains W3C trace context flags, which I've been told should be considered read-only in Collector processors until someone comes to us with a compelling use case for writing to them. At a minimum, without bitwise operators they're going to be hard to work with.\r\n\r\nUnless users are looking for only access to the raw bit sequence, I think we should consider implementing something different for traces and look to update the logs context to match once we're happy with it.", "> Are you ware of any usages of that field\r\n\r\nI am not.\r\n\r\nIf the current logs implementation is not useful I am ok with implementing flags for spans with specific flags in mind, but I do think we should make a generic path like logs in case there is some custom function someone wants to build that does something with the raw flags.", "This issue has been inactive for 60 days.

It has good browser support and would allow us to marginally reduce the bundle size.\n\n---------------\n\n_Do not alter or remove anything below. The following sections will be managed by moderators only._\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n\n* Use of `cloneDeep` within the codebase should be replaced with `structuredClone`.\n\n## Implementation Brief\n\n* Wait until we upgrade our version of Node to at least `17` (probably `18`), see #6026.\n* Replace every import of `cloneDeep` with `structuredClone`, eg `cloneDeep( object )` to `structuredClone( object )`.\n* At the time of writing, we have usage in the following files:\n  * `assets/js/modules/analytics-4/datastore/properties.test.js`\n  * `assets/js/modules/analytics-4/components/module/ModulePopularPagesWidgetGA4/index.js`\n  * `assets/js/modules/analytics-4/components/dashboard/DashboardAllTrafficWidgetGA4/UserCountGraph.js`\n  * `assets/js/modules/analytics-4/components/dashboard/DashboardAllTrafficWidgetGA4/UserDimensionsPieChart.js`\n  * `assets/js/modules/analytics-4/utils/data-mock.js`\n  * `assets/js/modules/reader-revenue-manager/components/settings/SettingsEdit.stories.js`\n  * `assets/js/modules/reader-revenue-manager/datastore/publications.test.js`\n  * `assets/js/components/GoogleChart/utils.js`\n  * `assets/js/components/wp-dashboard/WPDashboardPopularPagesGA4.js`\n  * `storybook/utils/resetGlobals.js`\n\n### Test Coverage\n\n* Tests should continue to pass without change; no new tests are needed.\n\n## QA Brief\n\n* <!-- One or more bullet points for how to test that the feature works as expected. -->\n\n## Changelog entry\n\n* <!-- One sentence summarizing the PR, to be used in the changelog. -->\n",

At the time LTS was 16, but I think it's worth exploring an upgrade to 18 as some other updates depend on a newer version as well.\r\n\r\nThen we can implement this according to the IB.

Still, the issue remains that once you press `Enter` in any of the input fields (or click the arrow button) there is no easy way to undo any changes - as @yskwon38  also stated.\r\n\r\nBut to me it seems now that the missing `Cancel` button is only a symptom of a larger issue, namely that the user editing UI is not very intuitive and actually confusing.\r\nI think the fact that you had to create an elaborate screenshot and write some text explaining how user editing works kind of supports my opinion.\r\nI know, one should read the manual, but I would think that editing a user should be a straight-forward task that requires little to no documentation at all.\r\n\r\nAnother example: I edit a user, change the user name, and click on `Done`. I reload the page and my change is gone / hasn't been saved. In this case the `Done` button actually **is** the `Cancel` button. No other form I used so far behaves this way.\r\n\r\nIn other (user) editing forms I usually see two different approaches:\r\n1. Editing a field and moving on to the next field (`onblur`) directly persists the changes\r\n2. Changes are only persisted after clicking a `Save` button at the end of the form. Clicking the `Cancel` button resets all changes made so far.\r\n\r\nI would like to suggest to change the NC user editing to the second approach. The currently used approach where one has to manually \"apply\" changes for every single input field by clicking the `arrow` button (without having the chance of undoing it) is - at least for me - a counter-intuitive approach, which leads to a sometimes frustrating user experience. Because it is so different from what I am used to from other forms and user editing is not a task that I do so often that I will get used to this approach. Basically, I have to think \"how did this work again?\" every time I start using NC's user management.\r\n\r\nAnd I am not sure if a simple re-labelling or adding tooltips to buttons will actually be enough to improve this. See my example above where the `Done` button label would actually have to get a different label depending on whether any input fields were edited **and** saved (`Done`) or just edited but **not** saved (`Cancel`).", "> But to me it seems now that the missing `Cancel` button is only a symptom of a larger issue, namely that the user editing UI is not very intuitive and actually confusing.\r\n> I think the fact that you had to create an elaborate screenshot and write some text explaining how user editing works kind of supports my opinion.\r\n> I know, one should read the manual, but I would think that editing a user should be a straight-forward task that requires little to no documentation at all.\r\n\r\nI think there might have been a misunderstanding. I'm a new contributor looking for interesting tickets to work on, I am not defending the current UI or trying to tell people to read the manual - I have actually had to go onto the users page and try every button before I realised the original feature request makes some incorrect assumptions about how things work.\r\n\r\n> Another example: I edit a user, change the user name, and click on `Done`. I reload the page and my change is gone / hasn't been saved. In this case the `Done` button actually **is** the `Cancel` button. No other form I used so far behaves this way.\r\n\r\nI agree with you - this is exactly how I found out the `Done` button does nothing. I was changing field values and then clicking the `Done` button and it was very confusing that my updates were not being saved.\r\n\r\n> And I am not sure if a simple re-labelling or adding tooltips to buttons will actually be enough to improve this.\r\n\r\nI didn't say that it was enough - rather that it would be an incremental improvement over what is there now. But a more substantial UI change should probably be discussed with the designers - perhaps you could bring it to their attention in #22864 which is an umbrella issue for design improvements in Nextcloud 20?

My apologies.\r\n\r\nYou are also correct, that when writing the original feature request I missed that there already is kind of a `Cancel` button. It just has a confusing label: the checkmark icon and the `Done` tooltip.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is only true for the text fields. The multi-select fields for group and group admin persist any changes immediately.\r\nSo that is another confusing inconsistency, I think.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I would still prefer a solution that gets rid of the `arrow` buttons and any auto-save-on-change completely, and just uses one `Save` and one `Cancel` button for the whole form.\r\n\r\nBut as you said, it might make sense to discuss such a change first with the nextcloud team before starting to work on it.\r\n", "I think there should be only one way to save changes and the \"done\" checkmark should be the way to go. Providing multiple ways could confuse the user, as it already does contributers here.

To remove this dependency from `Account/index`, create a new `StudioCopyToken` component with:\n- `KTextbox` as basis\n- `KIconButton` copy button and logic\n- `KCircularLoader` for loading state\n\nThen use `StudioCopyToken` in `Account/index` instead of `CopyToken`.\n\n## How to get there\n\n- Login as `user@a.com` with password `a`\n- Go to _Settings > Account_\n\n## Guidance\n\n- Read [the project](https://github.com/learningequality/studio/issues/5060) this issue is part of\n- When implementing the copy button, pay attention to a11y.

See the `*ngIf=...`\n\n<img width=\"1100\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3075c04-2f08-4e52-a55d-82d425131116\" />",

This is a place to report bugs to developers, after your server has been debugged. You can find help debugging your system on our home user forums: https://help.nextcloud.com or, if you use Nextcloud in a large organization, ask our engineers on https://portal.nextcloud.com. See also  https://nextcloud.com/support for support options.\r\n\r\nNextcloud is an open source project backed by Nextcloud GmbH. Most of our volunteers are home users and thus primarily care about issues that affect home users. Our paid engineers prioritize issues of our customers. If you are neither a home user nor a customer, consider paying somebody to fix your issue, do it yourself or become a customer.\r\n\r\nGuidelines for submitting issues:\r\n\r\n* Please search the existing issues first, it's likely that your issue was already reported or even fixed.\r\n    - Go to https://github.com/nextcloud and type any word in the top search/command bar. You probably see something like \"We couldn’t find any repositories matching ...\" then click \"Issues\" in the left navigation.\r\n    - You can also filter by appending e. g. \"state:open\" to the search string.\r\n    - More info on search syntax within github: https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues\r\n    \r\n* This repository https://github.com/nextcloud/server/issues is *only* for issues within the Nextcloud Server code. This also includes the apps: files, encryption, external storage, sharing, deleted files, versions, LDAP, and WebDAV Auth\r\n  \r\n* SECURITY: Report any potential security bug to us via our HackerOne page (https://hackerone.com/nextcloud) following our security policy (https://nextcloud.com/security/) instead of filing an issue in our bug tracker.  \r\n\r\n* The issues in other components should be reported in their respective repositories: You will find them in our GitHub Organization (https://github.com/nextcloud/)\r\n  \r\n* You can also use the Issue Template app to prefill most of the required information: https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/issuetemplate\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--- Please keep this note for other contributors -->\r\n\r\n### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the \uD83D\uDC4D [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add. It's just extra noise for everyone subscribed to this issue.\r\n* Subscribe to receive notifications on status change and new comments. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n1. create a folder \"test\"\r\n2. create a group \"test\"\r\n3. share folder \"test\" with group \"test\"\r\n4. delete group test\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\ndelete shares of group if group get deleted.\r\nif later same group name get created again (maybe with other members) it will automatically have all the shares from the past\r\n(this is also a \"security\" topic)\r\n\r\n### Server configuration\r\n\r\n**Nextcloud version:** 21.0.1\r\n",

In this section are entries like `Google Chrome - 132 (Linux)`. The entry is added as soon as the Nextcloud mobile app is connected to the Nextcloud installation and the username and password is entered in the mobile Chrome browser.\n\nThis is misleading. I think, it should be `Google Chrome - 132 (Android)`. Linux makes me think of a desktop computer or laptop running Linux.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Set up a recent Nextcloud AIO\n2. Login into the Nextcloud web interface on a desktop computer or laptop that is not running Linux and go to `/settings/user/security`\n3. Install the Nextcloud app on an Android device\n4. Make sure Google Chrome is the default browser on the Android device\n5. Enter the server address in the Nextcloud app to connect to it\n6. Wait for the Chrome browser on the Android device to open\n7. Authenticate yourself and grant access to the Nextcloud app\n8. Reload `/settings/user/security` on your desktop computer or laptop and you will see `Google Chrome - <version> (Linux)`\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nGoogle Chrome on Android should be reported as `Google Chrome - <version> (Android)' \n\nI don't have appropriate test devices but on iOS and iPadOS I would expect something like `Google Chrome - <version> (iOS)`,  `Apple Safari - <version> (iPadOS)`, and so on\n\n### Nextcloud Server version\n\n29\n\n### Operating system\n\nOther\n\n### PHP engine version\n\nNone\n\n### Web server\n\nNone\n\n### Database engine version\n\nNone\n\n### Is this bug present after an update or on a fresh install?\n\nFresh Nextcloud Server install\n\n### Are you using the Nextcloud Server Encryption module?\n\nEncryption is Disabled\n\n### What user-backends are you using?\n\n- [ ] Default user-backend _(database)_\n- [x] LDAP/ Active Directory\n- [ ] SSO - SAML\n- [ ] Other\n\n### Configuration report\n\n```json\n\n```\n\n### List of activated Apps\n\n```shell\n\n```\n\n### Nextcloud Signing status\n\n```shell\n\n```\n\n### Nextcloud Logs\n\n```json\n\n```\n\n### Additional info\n\n_No response_",

Every batch takes longer than the previous batch, and at this point each batch is taking around 1-2 minutes. This is much much slower than Spark, which remains consistent throughout the entire insertion. How can I speed this up? The Parquet files already have metadata so perhaps that could be exploited somehow?

If anybody wants to take a stab, you can search for `scrollUpMain` in the codebase to see how that works. We need versions of `scrollUpView` and `scrollDownView` in `pkg/gui/global_handlers.go` that take the scroll amount as a parameter, rather than hardcoding to use `gui.UserConfig.Gui.ScrollHeight` internally. Then we can pass them the height of the view as that parameter to have us scrolling by a whole page.", "btw @sdegutis if you want to get your hands dirty with Go, this would be a good first start!", "Sorry, to clarify, I'm requesting we use <kbd>Shift-PageUp</kbd> and <kbd>Shift-PageDown</kbd> (or Ctrl-).", "Tbh I mainly solved this by just setting scroll amount to 10 in config instead of the default of 2 and using the mouse wheel to scroll, so this can be closed if you want.", "By the way @jesseduffield when I looked through the src earlier, I was surprised this was written in Go.

I've had enough exposure to Rust to feel that Go is sorely lacking in features. Especially when it comes to code re-use, Go just doesn't have much (if anything) to offer due to lack of both inheritance, mixins/traits, and generics (though generics are on the way). I've done a fairly extensive writeup on my thoughts [here](https://jesseduffield.com/Gos-Shortcomings-1/) \r\n\r\n@glendsoza Nice one. I've left a comment on that PR. As commented, there's another PR in flight that's going to make it easier to use shift/ctrl modifiers, and hopefully that'll let us use pgdown/pgup.", "@jesseduffield I agree, I came to that conclusion maybe 7 years ago. I tried Rust out and I guess it's fine if you need low-level and lightning-fast and ultra-safe code, which I do 0% of the time (and apparently neither does VS Code but it works well enough). I'm going to try my hand at a quick Electron git client in TypeScript one of these days using [simple-git](https://www.npmjs.com/package/simple-git).", "I also vote for hotkeys for whole page scrolling. `C-f/C-b` (like manpage)  and `C-u/C-d` (like tig) both feels right to me. It should be configurable so there should just be a default one and let users choose what they like.", "@jesseduffield -- any update on this one? It'd be really lovely to be able to scroll by whole pages.", "As of v0.50 you can now focus the main view (by pressing `0`), and then you can navigate it using all the normal navigation keys like `.` and `,` for scrolling by page, or `<` and `>` for beginning/end.", "Given that we do now have a way of scrolling the main view both by line and by page via focusing it, I wonder if we should update the page-up/page-down keys to actually scroll by page now. Seems like lots of people are surprised that it currently defaults to only scrolling by line.\n\nOn the other hand, lots of lazygit users (myself included) have become accustomed to page-up/page-down only scrolling by lines", "@jesseduffield In this comment you only talk about scrolling by line vs. scrolling by page, but isn't the bigger difference which view they operate on? I'd expect pgup/pgdown to scroll the _current_ view (by page of course, not by line), not the main view. They would then do exactly the same as `,` and `.`, in the same way as home and end do the same as `<` and `>`.\n\nThis change makes a lot of sense to me, and I'm in favor. We still have two other ways of scrolling the main view (ctrl-d/u and J/K; they are both listed in the keybinding cheat sheets, but are otherwise not very discoverable).\n\nBut I'm probably not qualified to judge, because I rarely use the keyboard to scroll the main view; I use two fingers on the trackpad for that.", "As a vim user, I'm accustomed to `ctrl+u` and `ctrl+d` scrolling by _half pages_, and that is what I expected in the lazygit diff view (instead, it scrolls one line, just like pg up/dn). I'm very much in favor of making these scroll by page in the diff view. \n\nWhen I'm staging files for a commit, I'd like to quickly move from file to file, while being able to scroll quickly in the diff without having to switch focus back and forth between the panes. \n\nIdeally, scrolling by line should also be available somehow in this view. One suggestion would be to use `ctrl+e` and `ctrl+y` to scroll by line, just like in vim, however, I see that `ctrl+e` is already in use. `ctrl+j` and `ctrl+k` could also be agreeable, and seems to be available.", "We could also scroll alternative views by alt+down/up or ctrl+down/up", "I think a modifier + any-navigation keys applying to the current view would be good.\n\n`ctrl + ,` or `ctrl + .` applying to current view would be great. I also think we should have an alternative for line scrolling on the current view, page-up/down should really do what they say on the box imo.\n\n... I should really offer a PR rather than my opinion", "> As of v0.50 you can now focus the main view (by pressing `0`), and then you can navigate it using all the normal navigation keys like `.` and `,` for scrolling by page, or `<` and `>` for beginning/end.\n\nThanks, that's perfect!" ],

We need to add more to cover all the code in vllm-ascend, and there are several principles to follow:\n\n1. The overall file tree should be consistent with `vllm_ascend`\n2. The file name should be the original file name with a prefix `test_`\n3. Use `unittest` framework, make good use of mock\n4. The UTs are all running on cpu node, mock the function related to device to host\n\n### Unit tests need to add\n\n- [ ] |-- test__version.py\n- [x] |-- test_ascend_config.py\n- [ ] |-- test_attention\n- [ ] |   |-- test_attention.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_attention_v1.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_mla_v1.py\n- [ ] |-- compilation\n- [ ] |   `-- test_piecewise_backend.py\n- [ ] |-- core\n- [ ] |   |-- test_schedule_config.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_scheduler.py\n- [ ] |-- device_allocator\n- [ ] |   `-- test_camem.py\n- [ ] |-- distributed\n- [ ] |   |-- test_communicator.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_device_communicators\n- [ ] |   |   |-- test_pyhccl.py\n- [ ] |   |   `-- test_pyhccl_wrapper.py\n- [ ] |   |-- kv_transfer @Agonixiaoxiao \n- [ ] |   |   |-- test_simple_buffer.py\n- [ ] |   |   |-- test_simple_connector.py\n- [ ] |   |   |-- test_simple_pipe.py\n- [ ] |   |   `-- test_utils.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_llmdatadist_connector.py\n- [x] |   `-- test_parallel_state.py   @wangyanhui-cmss \n- [ ] |-- test_envs.py\n- [ ] |-- lora\n- [ ] |   `-- punica_wrapper\n- [ ] |       `-- test_punica_npu.py\n- [ ] |-- models\n- [ ] |   |-- test_deepseek_dbo.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_deepseek_mtp.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_deepseek_v2.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_qwen2_5_vl.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_qwen2_5_vl_without_padding.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_qwen2_vl.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_qwen3_moe.py\n- [ ] |-- multistream\n- [ ] |   |-- test_base.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_context.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_decorator.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_layers.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_metadata.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_ms_split.py\n- [ ] |-- ops\n- [ ] |   |-- test_activation.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_attention.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_cache.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_common_fused_moe.py\n- [x] |   |-- test_expert_load_balancer.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_fused_moe.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_layernorm.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_rotary_embedding.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_vocab_parallel_embedding.py\n- [ ] |-- patch\n- [ ] |   |-- platform\n- [ ] |   |   |-- patch_0_9_1\n- [ ] |   |   |-- patch_common\n- [ ] |   |   |   `-- test_test_patch_distributed.py\n- [ ] |   |   `-- patch_main\n- [ ] |   `-- worker\n- [ ] |       |-- patch_0_9_1\n- [ ] |       |-- patch_common\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_distributed.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_eagle.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_minicpm.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_multi_step_worker.py\n- [x] |       |   |-- test_patch_sampler.py\n- [ ] |       |   |-- test_patch_spec_decode_worker.py\n- [ ] |       |   `-- test_patch_utils.py\n- [ ] |       `-- patch_main\n- [ ] |-- test_platform.py @zhanghw0354\n- [ ] |-- quantization\n- [ ] |   |-- test_func_wrapper.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_quant_config.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_quantizer.py\n- [ ] |   |-- test_w8a8.py\n- [ ] |   `-- test_w8a8_dynamic.py\n- [ ] |-- sample\n- [ ] |   |-- ops\n- [ ] |   `-- test_rejection_sampler.py\n- [x] |-- test_utils.py\n- [ ] `-- worker \n- [ ] |-- test_cache_engine.py @machenglong2025\n- [ ] |-- test_draft_model_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_model_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_model_runner_v1.py\n- [ ]  |-- test_mtp_proposer_v1.py @machenglong2025\n- [ ] |-- test_multi_step_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_multi_step_worker.py\n- [ ] |-- test_pooling_model_runner.py\n- [ ] |-- test_worker.py @zhanghw0354\n- [ ] `-- test_worker_v1.py @zhanghw0354\n",

Having multiple inputs, such as for the NWP forecast grid + raw observations to generate the next analysis grid to more closely match how analysis files are actually generated could be helpful. Additionally, multiple outputs would be helpful, for example for #20 to output both the next NWP state and satellite image, potentially at different resolutions (i.e. HRV vs non-HRV channels for EUMETSAT), or for having more dense local outputs, it could be the global graph, and a local graph output in the decoder.\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n<!--- Why is this change important to you? How would you use it? -->\r\n<!--- How can it benefit other users? -->\r\n\r\n## Possible Implementation\r\nUpdate the latent graph processor to take multiple encoders. Multple outputs can be achieved by taking the output from the graph processor and giving it as inputs into multiple decoders. There would just need to be a way to give multiple decoder configs to the overall model.\r\n",

      "description" : "# Introduction\r\nWelcome to the project, if you pick up this Issue because of the \"GOOD FIRST USE\" label. You will be mentored through the process if you want. First the Issue is explained. At the end you will find some guidance for first contributors. Please do not hesitate to ask questions. Your solution don't need to be perfect.\r\n\r\nParticipation or contribution is not recommended unless you are familiar with Back In Time and are an active user. This project is not intended for learning basic Python skills or enhancing your profile at Microsoft GitHub.\r\n\r\n# Problem & suggested solution\r\nIn the Shortcuts pane, there is Root and Home that open the respective content lists. When BiT is run as user, it points to the user's home folder, which is fine. Run as root, \"Home\" points to root's home folder, which is also fine, but the name is misleading here. It would be more clear to rename that pointer to \"Root\" or \"/root\". To avoid confusion of `/` \"Root\" and `/root` \"Root\", what is now \"Root\" (`/`) ought to be named more specifically, e.g. \"Filesystem\" or \"Root Filesystem\" or \"Filesystem Root\". If space is at a premium, omit the icons.\r\n\r\n# Your next steps\r\n1. If this is your first contribution in this project please introduce your self and tell us about your skills, wishes and plans. Also let us know how you found the issue and the project.\r\n2. Read the existing [contributors documentation](https://github.com/bit-team/backintime/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md).\r\n3. We can develop the next steps in the further discussion. Don't hesitate to ask.\r\n\r\n# Original post\r\n\r\nTwo cosmetic points that might make their way into a general GUI overhaul.\r\n\r\n- Get rid of that pesky \"Main profile\". The name is not meaningful and not editable, so one has to take notes what that profile actually does, or disable it altogether. Still when the GUI is launched, \"Main profile\" is opened first and complains if it can't find its backup folder. That in turn can be mitigated with a dummy backup folder that is always available (I use `/root/.backintime-dummy/` and  `/home/user/.backintime-dummy/`), but this is an ugly situation. I guess \"Main profile\" is a leftover from very early days of BiT when it had a more limited functionality. It' done it's job and can go now.\r\n\r\n- In the Shortcuts pane, there is Root and Home that open the respective content lists. When BiT is run as user, it points to the user's home folder, which is fine. Run as root, \"Home\" points to root's home folder, which is also fine, but the name is misleading here. It would be more clear to rename that pointer to \"Root\" or \"/root\".

You can't be sure anymore. And especially in open source projects, there is a lot of AI generated code from star-catching kids around. Sometimes it is hard to distinguish.\n\nOK, than go for it.\n\nFirst of all please check the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/bit-team/backintime/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nThe original issue is a bit broad and confuse because I wasn't sure myself how to solve the problem. It contains several issues and tasks. First of all I would say you can ignore the \"shortcuts pane\" and just work on the \"Root-Mode\" label in the status bar. This is a quit easy and tiny task to begin with. After that we can think about the \"shortcuts pane\".\n\nThe elements in the main window (including the status bar) are all defined in `qt/app.py` ([statusbar is here](https://github.com/bit-team/backintime/blob/de0838beedf8fae7e8970b8f76d37a0af2b2a906/qt/app.py#L287-L295)).

      "description" : "### Prerequisites\n\n- [x] I have written a descriptive issue title\n- [x] I have searched existing issues to ensure the bug has not already been reported\n\n\n### Fastify version\n\n5.2.1\n\n### Plugin version\n\n11.0.2\n\n### Node.js version\n\n22.14.0\n\n### Operating system\n\nmacOS\n\n### Operating system version (i.e. 20.04, 11.3, 10)\n\n15.5\n\n### Description\n\n## Background\n\nWe have a test scenario where our server immediately sends a websocket protocol \"ping\" upon a client connecting as part of starting a heartbeat. Currently the client created by `.injectWS()` does NOT register `ws.on(\"ping\", () => ws.pong())` causing this ping to be lost.\n\n## Attempted Workarounds\n\nWe've tried immediately registering it, but this causes a race condition as we don't get access to the websocket until after the connection has completed:\n\n```ts\nconst ws = server.injectWS(\"/ws\")\nws.on(\"ping\", () => ws.pong())\n```\n\nGiven the flakiness of this, we added a server side delay to starting the heartbeat. This is not ideal but is a sufficient workaround until a proper fix can be done.\n\n## Suggested Fix\n\nIt seems like a one line addition of `ws.on(\"ping\", () => ws.pong())` could be done here where `.on(\"open\", ...)` is already set:\n\nhttps://github.com/fastify/fastify-websocket/blob/90ac47d51d7b72c186311d0c58ded1af42a92a76/index.js#L67-L70\n\n## Impact & Risk of Change\n\nThis seems like a low impact change as no other aspects of testing the websocket outside of the built in ping/pong protocol seem to be impacted by this, as best I can tell. If that impact is still deemed too substantial then the desire to enable ping/pong could be done as part of the data handed to `.injectWS()`.\n\n## Closing Remarks\n\nJust wanted to say thank you for all the great work on `fustily-websocket`! We rely on it for production uses and have been extremely happy with it \uD83D\uDE04 I'm happy to open a small PR for this if desired. \n\n### Link to code that reproduces the bug\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/code-ape/bc6199713f9fee8415b6998db1b1f9fa\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe client created by `.injectWS()` should have `.on(\"ping\", () => ws.pong())` set by default.",

Please describe.\n\nCurrently, we allow descriptive stream names such as `NPP, ATMS` following a known convention in the satellite world. See [this example](https://github.com/ecmwf/WeatherGenerator/pull/328/files#diff-f893baba4f83facdfc557997e6bf4b389b927123e41035d4450fbb06e957b5f7). However, logging systems only want simple names for metrics such as `a.b.c`. where `a` is `a-zA-Z0-9-_` . It could be more but I would not push because it would break pandas column selection.\n\nAs a result, we cannot really have per-stream metrics, which would be useful for example to track how many samples are being ingested per stream. In this case it would be `streams.NPP, ATMS.count_samples` which would cause issues with WandB or MLFlow.\n\nI see 3 ways forward:\n\n- magic: conversion of `NPP, ATMS` to camelCase `NppAtms` for example\n- convention: only allow names that follow the convention above and return error instead\n- extra info: when defining a stream name, require a user to set an `stream_id` as a unique machine-ready identifier (for example `NPP_ATMS`)\n\nIn any case, I believe this name should be `a-zA-Z0-9_` (no _ to prevent weird issues with databases or pandas)\n\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/47964380/pandas-dataframe-column-naming-conventions\n\n\n\nDo you have any thoughts on that?\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Organisation\n\n_No response_",

During the first stage of training, the strong information bottleneck created by the VQ-VAE codebook forces the learned latent actions to capture only the information not inferable from task instructions—resulting in task-irrelevant latent actions.\n\nIn the second stage, with these task-irrelevant latents frozen, the newly initialized latent actions are trained to replace the role of language, allowing them to learn task-centric dynamics.\n\nThis also explains why, in naive latent action learning approaches like LAPA and Genie, latent action tokens mostly encode motion/dynamics—since texture information is already preserved from previous frames for future frame prediction in the decoder. ", "If your goal is to learn task-relevant tokens, why not directly use contrastive learning to encode those tokens and perform a soft alignment with the text instruction features? Have you tried this approach? It seems like a more straightforward way to achieve your objective.\n", "@retsuh-bqw Thanks for your detailed explanation.\n\nTo support your claims, I think it would be helpful to demonstrate what kind of behavior the latent actions actually exhibit.

Today the gateway gives up on the first failure, crashing with `psycopg2.OperationalError: connection … refused`.

      "description" : "### \uD83E\uDDED Epic\n\n**Title:** Test Server Connectivity from Gateway UI  \n**Goal:** Help administrators debug server setup issues by interactively sending custom HTTP requests to configured MCP servers  \n**Why now:** When adding a new MCP server, it's often unclear if a given URL or endpoint is live, secure, or responding as expected. Today, users must use curl/Postman to debug. This feature allows testing any method, path, headers, or body directly from the Gateway UI.\n\n---\n\n### \uD83E\uDDED Type of Feature\n\n- [x] New functionality\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDE4B‍♂️ User Story 1\n\n**As a:** Gateway administrator  \n**I want:** to send custom HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.) to any path on the server I'm configuring  \n**So that:** I can debug connectivity, validate endpoint behavior, and inspect the actual server responses before saving\n\n#### ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n```gherkin\nScenario: Send a custom request to the server before saving\n  Given I am adding a new server in the Gateway UI\n  And I enter a server base URL\n  When I click \"Test Server\"\n  Then I should be able to:\n    - Choose an HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)\n    - Enter a relative path (e.g., /health)\n    - Provide optional headers and request body\n  When I click \"Send\"\n  Then the system sends the request to base_url + path\n  And I should see:\n    - HTTP status code\n    - Total response time (latency)\n    - Response body (pretty-printed JSON if possible)\n```\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDCD0 Design Sketch (optional)\n\n```\n+-------------------- Gateway UI ---------------------+\n| Server URL: https://api.example.com                |\n|                                                    |\n| [ Test Server ] ← opens test panel                 |\n+----------------------------------------------------+\n\n⇣ click\n\n+-------------------- Test Server --------------------+\n| Method: [GET ▼]                                     |\n| Path: /version                                      |\n| Headers (JSON): { \"Authorization\": \"Bearer xyz\" }  |\n| Body (JSON): { \"foo\": \"bar\" } (for POST, PUT...)   |\n| [ Send ]                                            |\n|                                                    |\n| ⇣ Results                                           |\n| ➤ Status: 200 OK                                    |\n| ➤ Latency: 120 ms                                   |\n| ➤ Response:                                         |\n| {                                                   |\n|   \"version\": \"1.0.0\",                               |\n|   \"status\": \"healthy\"                               |\n| }                                                   |\n+-----------------------------------------------------+\n```\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDD17 MCP Standards Check\n\n- [x] No impact on protocol or server discovery logic\n- [x] Safe, diagnostic-only feature\n- [x] Follows existing conventions for JSON and HTTP tooling\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDD04 Alternatives Considered\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons |\n|--------|------|------|\n| Predefined test list (/health, /version) | Simpler UI | Not flexible, less useful for real-world debugging |\n| Silent background ping | No UI work | Less control, can miss issues with specific headers/methods |\n| CLI-only debug tools | No frontend work | Fragments experience, not user-friendly\n\n---\n\n### \uD83D\uDCD3 Additional Context\n\n- This is especially useful when:\n  - Testing authenticated or proxied servers\n  - Verifying custom response structures\n  - Diagnosing CORS or TLS errors from browser context\n- Future enhancements could include:\n  - Copy-as-curl button\n  - History of past test requests\n  - Auto-fill common headers like `Content-Type: application/json`\n",

Update the docs/docs/using/.pages file to add a link to this new mcp-cli documentation page for discoverability.\n\n3. Verify the instructions by testing mcp-cli usage with MCP Gateway and mcpgateway-wrapper locally if feasible.\n\nlet me know your thoughts and I can start working on it. ", "Sounds good, thanks!

      "description" : "This is a feature request to track a potential PR to implement it. I'm also looking for feedback for both naming and implementation preference.\n\nUsers can currently speed up Target Quality by only encoding down to only 1/4 of the frames in a chunk by specifying `--probing-rate 2..4`. We'll call this current behavior the \"rate\" strategy. We find this strategy acceptable because we consider that not all frames in a scene/chunk are necessary to accurately probe it and the speed-accuracy tradeoff is worth it. With that in mind, I propose a different strategy for reducing the computation in Target Quality probing: the \"subset\" strategy. This strategy would probe only the middle N frames in a chunk. Users can specify the number of frames to probe with `--probe-strategy subset --probing-subset N`. So for a given chunk of 400 frames, users can specify `--probing-subset 50` to probe only 50 frames in the middle.\n\nIt's possible to implement both strategies simultaneously but for simplicity we can only support just one strategy at a time. For now, I initially propose 2 new options: `--probe-strategy` (or alternatively `--probe-type`) and `--probing-subset <INT>`. The value for `--probe-stategy` can be `rate` or `subset` and defaults to `rate` to match the current behavior. `--probing-rate <INT>` will be ignored when using `--probe-strategy subset` and vice-versa for `--probing-subset <INT>` and `--probe-strategy rate` (default).\n\nI understand there are valid reasons to avoid using subsets in Target Quality mode, but I have had satisfactory results with this strategy in my own custom reimplementation of Target Quality and would like to see it implemented in the core product as an optional feature. I personally use ~20 frames per chunk so it's significantly faster than 1/4 of a very long chunk.\n\nThanks,\n\\- Boats M.",

Given that, it might be helpful to make this redirection behavior customizable.\n\nSuggestion:\nAdding an optional setting to disable pie menu redirection and instead allow the assigned command to execute would be very useful—especially for users who customize many shortcuts or manage complex menu systems.\n\nThis would remove unnecessary limitations and offer more flexibility in how users design their workflows.\n\n### Affected Desktop Environments\n\nWindows\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_",

The difference is only their color but the design is the same.\n\nUsually, when I have this initial theme with gruvbox color:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9622e6b-c044-4847-9b16-7f5f30ec06c7)\n\nwith the related icon files `blueteam.svg`, you can see it is right.\n\nNow I change my theme and I also replace my icon files, like `blueteam.svg` with red colors (so the existing yellow one will be replaced/deleted). When I do this, and I invoke Kando, Kando still remains with the old non-existing icons (probably because it uses a cache):\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dcc1eb3c-0054-4029-b9a0-f3520c3cbe4e)\n\nI also tried to use `kando --reload menu-theme` but it does not refresh the icons. I'm forced each time to close kando completely and reopen it.\n\n\n### Kando Version\n\n1.8.0\n\n### Installation Method\n\nVia a package manger\n\n### Desktop Environment\n\nGNOME on X11\n\n### Environment Version\n\nAthena OS (Arch-based) GNOME 48\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_",

Forked and cloned the repository, then searched the codebase for `readline` usage to find the core input handling logic.\n2.  Identified `useKeypress.ts` (for raw keypress events) and `InputPrompt.tsx` (for input logic) as the key files.\n3.  To see what the application receives, I temporarily modified the code to log every keypress event to a `debug.log` file.\n4.  **Key Finding:** My initial debugging proved that on a default macOS Terminal, `Shift+Enter` sends the exact same sequence (`\\r`) as a regular `Enter` press, making the two indistinguishable.\n\n### Attempted Fix & The Final Discovery\n\nBased on the initial finding, I attempted a code-only fix by teaching the application to listen for a different key combination, `Shift+Down`, which often sends a unique sequence on other terminals.\n\n1. The Code I Tested\nI modified `useKeypress.ts` to listen for the `Shift+Down` sequence (`\\x1b[1;2B`) and `InputPrompt.tsx` to handle a `key.shift` flag.\n\n```typescript\n// In useKeypress.ts, I added a check:\nif (key.sequence === '\\x1b[1;2B') {\n  key.name = 'return';\n  key.shift = true;\n}\n```\n```typescript\n// In InputPrompt.tsx, I added the key.shift check:\nif (key.ctrl || key.meta || key.shift || charBefore === '\\\\' || key.paste) {\n  // ... newline logic\n}\n```\n\n2. The Result: It Also Failed\nThis proof-of-concept did not work. To understand why, I used the `cat` command to see what my terminal was actually sending when I pressed `Shift+Down`.\nFinal Proof: The terminal sent `^[[B`, which is the standard escape code for a plain Cursor Down key.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis investigation leads to a definitive conclusion: the default macOS Terminal is more limited than anticipated. It appears to strip the `Shift` modifier information from both the `Enter` key and the arrow keys, making a code-only fix for a `Shift+Key` newline combination unfeasible on this specific platform, although i think this might work on other platforms which by default register shift + down as '\\x1b[1;2B' but i cant really test it.\n\nThis might explain why `Ctrl+J` is a common suggested alternative, as it sends a universal newline character (`\\n`) that doesn't rely on modifier key parsing.\n\nAs this is my first contribution, my analysis could be wrong, and I apologize for the detailed-but-failed attempt. Given these findings, what is the desired path forward? Any information from the internal `b.corp.google.com` link about how other terminals are supported would still be very helpful.\n\nThank you for your time and guidance.", "Just to add, I personally use the Warp Terminal on Mac.

All attempts fail. It is unknown what triggered this, perhaps an update to the model on hugging face?\n\n## To Reproduce\n\nRun this test:\n\n`cargo test -p runtime --test integration_models --features models,metal -- huggingface_test_nsql --nocapture`\n\n```text\n2025-06-29T07:57:04.889440Z  INFO runtime::init::dataset: Dataset taxi_trips registered (s3://spiceai-demo-datasets/taxi_trips/2024/), acceleration (arrow), results cache enabled.\n2025-06-29T07:57:04.891103Z DEBUG runtime::accelerated_table::refresh: Starting scheduled refresh\n2025-06-29T07:57:04.891221Z  INFO runtime::accelerated_table::refresh_task: Loading data for dataset taxi_trips\n2025-06-29T07:57:04.908717Z  INFO object_store::aws::builder: Using Instance credential provider\n2025-06-29T07:57:08.618318Z TRACE runtime::accelerated_table::refresh_task: [refresh] Received 10 rows for dataset: taxi_trips\n2025-06-29T07:57:08.618519Z  INFO runtime::accelerated_table::refresh_task: Loaded 10 rows (18.43 kiB) for dataset taxi_trips in 3s 727ms.\n2025-06-29T07:57:08.618572Z DEBUG runtime::accelerated_table::refresh_task_runner: Refresh task successfully completed for dataset taxi_trips\n2025-06-29T07:57:08.618886Z DEBUG runtime::accelerated_table::refresh: Received refresh task completion callback: Ok(())\n2025-06-29T07:57:08.619354Z DEBUG runtime::init::scheduler: Dataset 'taxi_trips' has no refresh cron specified, skipping schedule creation\n2025-06-29T07:57:08.697600Z  INFO integration_models::models::nsql: Running test cases hf_with_model\n2025-06-29T07:57:08.698388Z  INFO runtime: All components are loaded.

If you are planing on helping out will multiple sections, then submit 1 or 2, and I will review them and then you can do more. Because the rst2myst does make mistakes, the reviewer(probably me) needs to click on every link and check carefully line by line.  \n\nJust add a comment to what section you are working on. \n\nAn unfortunate downside is that the git blame will be reset for the docs files. \n\nThe index.rst file needs to be the last file converted since I cannot figure out to have rst files and a md file as the index.

A higher accuracy score indicates better performance ([ref](https://github.com/securefederatedai/openfl/blob/develop/openfl/component/aggregator/aggregator.py#L1154)). This is good practice in general, but is limited to metrics where higher score indicates better performance. There will be cases where a user will use a loss metric for validation. In this case, lower values indicate better performance and the Task Runner will not save the best model since it is looking for the highest value.\n\nThis configuration should be via the enabled via `plan.yaml`\nA natural location to consider would be the `task_*.yaml` ([ref](https://github.com/securefederatedai/openfl/blob/develop/openfl-workspace/workspace/plan/defaults/tasks_torch.yaml#L6))\n",

(need action1 done)\n\nMove the connector creation logic from `Connector` to `ConnectorFactory`.\n\n\nThe benefits:\n- Know the relationship between parameters. Use the `optionRule` check the config before create connector instance.\n- This can be used in SeaTunnelWeb.\n\n\nWelcome to do this with me\n\n### Task list\n\n\n| type       |

accomplish?\n\n- List and describe the connector parameters in the `Factory.optionRule()` method.\nWhile doing so, we can move all parameters into the XXXXOptions class to unify the code style and centralize the parameters into a single file.\n\n- Move the connector creation logic into `Factory.createSource/createSink`.\nImplement the `createSource/createSink` methods in Factory and instantiate the corresponding connector.\n\n\n\n### Are you willing to submit PR?\n\n- [x] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!",

What it would be look like?\n\nAbout proposal2\nnow some connector implement the `TableSourceFactory`, but they not implement `createSource` method. so we still has 2 way to create the `Connector` instance.\n- one is use `tableSourceFactory.createSource/Sink()` it return the connector instance.\n- one is use `ServiceLoader.load` to load all implement and use `pluginIdentifier` to find the connector instance.\n\nSo I suggest we unified the behavior, implement the `createSource/Sink` method. use `Factory` to create the connector instance. \n\n\n```\n    private static boolean isFallback(Optional<Factory> factory) {\n        if (!factory.isPresent()) {\n            return true;\n        }\n        try {\n            ((TableSourceFactory) factory.get()).createSource(null);\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            if (e instanceof UnsupportedOperationException\n                    && \"The Factory has not been implemented and the deprecated Plugin will be used.\"\n                            .equals(e.getMessage())) {\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n```\n", "Oh I got it.

      "description" : "### Description\r\nWe currently include the default layout of [tagify](https://github.com/yairEO/tagify/) by copying the original CSS file from the npm package [in gulp](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-server/blob/1acd2ff884e176aa2434d5527fd05f4eb7ecd717/gulpfile.ts#L136). However, the tagify package also provides a [source SCSS file](https://github.com/yairEO/tagify/blob/v4.22.2/src/tagify.scss). It would be interesting to use the SCSS file instead and adapt the styling to our new website design.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Solution\r\n1. Use tagifies' SCSS file as a modifiable base instead of the pre-built CSS file\r\n1. Update the styling to match our new website design.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n- Consistent styling with our website design.\r\n- Easier maintenance and customization using SCSS.\r\n\r\n### Implementation Steps\r\n1. Create a new SCSS file, which included the tagify SCSS file.\r\n1. Use that SCSS file instead of the CSS file in Gulp, so it's copied to `css/dist/tagify.css` during build\r\n1. Update the styling as needed.\r\n\r\n### Additional Notes\r\n- Ensure compatibility with other components and styles in our project.",

It draws a straight line between the cursor position last time the lasso was removed and when it's now restored, allowing the user to also use this as a technique for drawing straight line sections of the lasso, but also just to decide to use box selection instead of lasso at any time.\n- Ctrl+dragging an *object* currently drags its layer(s) but we want to make it instead always lasso select. This lets the user perform a lasso selection over an existing layer, or a box selection but releasing Ctrl as in the previous bullet point.\n- Lasso selection has a bug that should be fixed: aborting the lasso selection (RMB or Esc) then creating a new lasso selection ends up erroneously extending the previously drawn lasso path because abort fails to clear the lasso data (which also wastes memory!).

      "comments" : [ "Hi there! \uD83D\uDC4B\n\nI’d love to work on this “TypeScript mock implementations” task so our frontend & backend teams can develop against the StarkHive contracts before deployment. Here’s my high-level plan:\n\n1. **Interface scaffolding**  \n   - Pull the exact `NFTContractInterface`, `JobContractInterface`, etc. from Issues #440 & #441.  \n   - Generate TS stubs for each contract method & event signature.\n\n2. **Mock implementations**  \n   - For each contract interface, create a `MockXyzContract` class that simulates state in-memory (e.g. `Map<…>`).  \n   - Implement all methods with realistic return types, incrementing IDs or toggling states as needed.  \n   - Include optional IPFS-style metadata where applicable.\n\n3. **Configurable delays & errors**  \n   - Add a shared `MockConfig` where teams can set per-contract or per-method delays (in ms) and error rates.  \n   - Wrap methods in a helper that injects `await sleep(config.delay)` and randomly throws when `config.errorRate > 0`.\n\n4. **Dockerized local server**  \n   - Spin up an Express (or Fastify) HTTP+JSON-RPC server exposing each mock contract under distinct endpoints (e.g. `/mock/nft/mint`).  \n   - Write a `Dockerfile` that installs dependencies, builds TS, and starts the mock server.  \n   - Expose ports & volume-mount docs for easy local use.\n\n5. **Documentation & examples**  \n   - Add a `README.md` with:\n     - Installation via `docker build` + `docker run`\n     - Environment variables or JSON config format\n     - Sample TS code showing how to `import { MockNFTContract }` or call the Docker-based RPC.  \n   - Provide a small `example/` folder with a Next.js or Node script that mints a token, polls for events, and demonstrates error injection.\n\n6. **Testing**  \n   - Write unit tests (Jest) to assert that each mock follows its interface and respects delays/errors.  \n   - Add a CI step in `mock/` that runs these tests.\n\nI’ll follow the project’s CONTRIBUTING guidelines, commit under a branch named `mock-contracts-setup`, and open a draft PR once I’ve scaffolded the first two mocks. Please assign this issue to me or let me know if there’s any other setup I should follow first.

I think the bug is in [this](https://github.com/fjall-rs/lsm-tree/blob/main/src/compaction/fifo.rs#L72) line. It is calling `levels.size()`, but that doesn't include the size of the blobs. We can see [here](https://github.com/fjall-rs/lsm-tree/blob/main/src/blob_tree/mod.rs#L562) that the `BlobTree::disk_usage()` considers both the size of the index (keys) & blobs (values).\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n1. In the [rolling-log](https://github.com/fjall-rs/fjall/blob/main/examples/rolling-log/src/main.rs) example, enable kv separation & change inserted value to `[0; 1024]`\n2. Run the example & watch it crash on the assert after 5 steps.\n\n**Expected behavior**\nThe partition should be compacted as per the docs.\n\n**Additional context**\nI'm using fjall, not this crate directly. But since `Fifo` is defined in this crate, I'm opening this issue here.\n",

Issues with outdated version will be REJECTED.\r\n- Search the bugtracker for similar site feature requests: http://yt-dl.org/search-issues. DO NOT post duplicates.\r\n- Finally, put x into all relevant boxes (like this [x])\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] I'm reporting a site feature request\r\n- [x] I've verified that I'm running youtube-dl version **2021.12.17**\r\n- [x] I've searched the bugtracker for similar site feature requests including closed ones\r\n\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nProvide an explanation of your site feature request in an arbitrary form. Please make sure the description is worded well enough to be understood, see https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl#is-the-description-of-the-issue-itself-sufficient. Provide any additional information, suggested solution and as much context and examples as possible.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWith the latest google search versions, one can look up \"NFL\" (for example), and the schedules, players and teams pop-up as well as (and this is what I'm suggesting to implement) previews or highlights. When trying to download them from the Google page, it does not recognizes it, the user needs to get into the actual video (youtube in most cases) to get it. Implementing this would mean much faster access to videos and the users not having to navigate several layers of webpages to download them.\r\nI tried creating a general \"google extractor\" but couldn't manage to do it. Other option I thought about but could not put into practice was to handle that webpage forwarding (google search -> youtube) within the program\r\n",

Some changes will be specific to yt-dlp and need to be adapted so as to run on both Python 2 and 3. For example, the linked commit includes these lines that will fail in Python 2 \r\n```\r\n                'http://www.google.com/search', f'gvsearch:{query}',\r\n                note=f'Downloading result page {pagenum + 1}',\r\n```\r\nYou'll need to change this in some way, say:\r\n```\r\n                'http://www.google.com/search', 'gvsearch:' + query,\r\n                note='Downloading result page %d' % (pagenum + 1, ),\r\n```\r\n\r\nSome IDE plug-in or judicious use of _vi_ and _diff_ could achieve the same result.\r\n\r\nIf there is a specific change, a commit or set of commits, that should be applied, you can use _git_ magic to apply such commits while preserving the commit details. In GH you can add `.patch` to commit and PR URLs to generate a patch file that you can pass to the `git am` command: to make the patch applicable you first have to edit it to replace the `yt_dlp/` in pathnames with `youtube_dl/`. After applying the patch to your branch you can make any additional changes in your own subsequent commit. Eventually when this gets merged we would probably `squash` the commits in the PR so that the resulting commit appears as `Co-authored by:` all the people whose commits are included.\r\n\r\nAs above, test the modified extractor in your patch branch (there's a small test in the linked commit). Then push the branch to your yt-dl fork. You should be able to enable the server-side tests that ensure your changes work in a variety of supported environments.

However, the `ccusage blocks --live` monitor in the terminal shows the session ending at a different time (8 PM in the attached screenshot).\n\nThis difference can be a bit confusing as it's not clear which timer to follow. Could you please clarify if this is the expected behavior?\n\n#### **Steps to Observe the Behavior**\n1. On macOS with the latest version of VS Code.\n2. Have the Claude Code extension installed.\n3. In the VS Code integrated terminal, run the command `ccusage@latest blocks --live`.\n4. The time displayed by the extension in the editor's top bar (\"resets at 6pm\") differs from the \"Remaining\" time in the `ccusage` monitor (e.g., shows end time of 8:00:00 PM).\n\n#### **My Expectation**\nFor clarity, I would expect both timers to be synchronized and reflect the actual session end time.\n\n#### **Screenshots**\nAs shown in the screenshot, the top right of the IDE indicates a reset time of 6 PM, while the `ccusage` session monitor in the terminal shows a session end time of 8 PM.\n\n#### **Environment**\n* **OS:** macOS\n* **IDE:** Visual Studio Code (Latest Version)\n* **Tool:** `ccusage@latest`\n* **Extension Name & Version:** Claude Code `[Please add extension version if known]`\n\nThank you for looking into this.　",
